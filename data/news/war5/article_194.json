    "text": "Trending: Bulgarian PM: \"We do not need any other peace in Ukraine if it is not a just and fair one\" Bulgarian Prime Minister Nikolai Denkov emphasized that Ukraine is fighting not only for its independence and territorial integrity but also for Europe. Peace in Ukraine after the war with Russia must be just and based on the international order. The Bulgarian Prime Minister said this in an interview with [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/01/17/bulgaria-pm-ukraine-is-fighting-for-europe.html) at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday, January 18. At the same time, he noted that Europe must be \"united to be strong.\" Answering a journalist's question about how European leaders could convince Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban to support Ukraine, Denkov said that \"logical arguments\" should be used. One such argument is that the war in Ukraine started by Russia should end as soon as possible on fair terms, not on Moscow's demands. \"We do not need any other peace rather than a just, fair and consistent with the international order. This is the only way it can be sustainable. If Hungary is isolated in this process, it will create problems for this country, not just for Europe. Therefore, I believe that the states located on the eastern flank, in particular Hungary, will benefit from being united in this matter,\" Denkov emphasized.
