    "text": " MCLEAN, Va., Jan. 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HII HII announced today that its Mission Technologies division was awarded a $197 million recompete task order contract to conduct research and development for the Joint Training Synthetic Environment (JTSE), which blends live and virtual training into a single synthetic environment that enables joint force readiness.\nAdministered by the Joint Staff J7, Deputy Director of Joint Training, HII will develop, maintain, support and provide joint training in a synthetic environment across combatant commands, military service branches, federal agencies, academia, industry and multi-national partners. The JTSE is designed to evolve with changing operational needs, providing accessible exercises that mirror the complexity of real-world scenarios.\n\"As the battlespace becomes more complex, so does the need for warfighters who are fully equipped to handle any challenge,\" said Glenn Goodman, president of Mission Technologies' LVC Solutions business group. \"We are committed to the development and delivery of a truly integrated, high-fidelity training capability that supports the future fight.\"\nHII was awarded this task order under the Department of Defense Information (DoD) Analysis Center's (IAC) multiple-award contract (MAC) vehicle.
