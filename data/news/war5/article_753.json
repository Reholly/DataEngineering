    "text": "NEW DELHI: The UK's ministry of defence (MoD) has recently achieved a significant breakthrough in testing a military laser capable of engaging any visible targets in the air or at sea.The global interest in directed energy weapons has seen a notable increase, with significant advancements also being made in the United States.The DragonFire laser, a high-precision energy weapon developed by the MoD, can strike targets with the speed of light. This weapon is so precise that it can hit a target as small as a coin, approximately 2.3 centimeters in diameter, from a distance of over 1 kilometer (0.6 miles). Moreover, the operational cost of the DragonFire laser is considerably lower than that of conventional air defense systems, a Newsweek report said.A significant milestone was reached with the UK MoD's announcement of the first high-power firing of the laser weapon against an aerial target. However, the full extent of DragonFire's range remains classified.In a recent address in London, Britain's defense secretary Grant Shapps highlighted the transformative potential of such advanced weaponry. He said, \\\"This type of cutting-edge weaponry has the potential to revolutionize the battlespace by reducing the reliance on expensive ammunition, while also lowering the risk of collateral damage.\\\"The MoD has revealed that the cost per shot of the DragonFire is under Â£10 [$12.70], positioning it as a cost-effective alternative for certain missions currently undertaken by missiles. Both the British Army and the Royal Navy are considering incorporating the DragonFire into their future air defense strategies.The development of the laser is a collaborative effort involving the MoD's Defense Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) and several British industry partners. The project marked its initial success with the first high-power static firing of the laser in November 2022, demonstrating its capability to track and engage aerial and sea targets with remarkable precision.Paul Hollinshed, the head of Dstl, emphasized the significance of these trials, saying, \\\"These trials have seen us take a huge step forward in realizing the potential opportunities and understanding the threats posed by directed energy weapons. With our decades of knowledge, skills, and operational experience, Dstl's expertise is critical to helping the armed forces prepare for the future.\\\"The Government Accountability Office (GAO) in the United States has noted that the US military has been exploring various prototypes of directed energy weapons, primarily for counter-drone operations, over the past decade. According to a report from May 2023, these weapons offer a cost-effective air defense solution with virtually unlimited firing capacity. However, they generally have a shorter range compared to traditional missiles and artillery and can be affected by adverse weather conditions. The GAO has also expressed concerns regarding the potential long-term health impacts of exposure to directed energy weapons.",
