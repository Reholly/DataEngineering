Since the launch of a new round of east-west collaboration in 2021, the collaborating provinces have given full play to the comparative advantages of each region, strengthened industrial cooperation, resource complementarity, labor docking, and talent exchanges, forming a multi-level, multi-form, and all-round collaborative assistance pattern. At present, East-West cooperation has become an important force in consolidating and expanding the results of poverty alleviation and promoting comprehensive rural revitalization. In 2023, 8 eastern provinces and cities will invest 23.19 billion yuan in financial assistance to 10 western provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities, and the two parties will exchange 3,045 temporary party and government cadres and 25,000 professional and technical personnel.

Complementary regional advantages and two-way flow of factors Complementary regional advantages and two-way flow of factors Promote the vigorous development of industries that strengthen the county and enrich the people Promote the vigorous development of industries that strengthen the county and enrich the people In Kuiduo Town, Jiulong County, Sichuan Province, there are 3,900 acres of alpine tea gardens covered with greenery. At the beginning of winter, Xihu District of Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province and local tea experts jointly held a preliminary winter management research and judgment meeting, organizing tea farmers to carry out deep plowing, pruning, rejuvenation and other management and maintenance operations to lay the foundation for the germination of new tea in spring. In the live broadcast room not far away, a black tea jointly produced by West Lake District and Jiulong County is selling like hot cakes - Kowloon local tea is combined with the production technology of West Lake Jiuqu Red Plum, and the tea has a particularly long-lasting aroma. \"A leaf on the southern slope of Gongga condenses the deep tea relationship between the two places.\" Qin Xiuzhen, secretary of the Party Committee of Kuido Town, said that the local area has many original ecological ancient tea trees and the tea is of good quality, but the mountains are high and the roads are far away, so sales have always been slow. On one side is a high-quality raw material production base, on the other side is mature technology and marketing experience. With the cooperation and assistance of Xihu District, Manshan Tea has become a gold-producing \"tea industry.\" Qin Xiuzhen introduced that in the past two years, an all-weather grid monitoring system and a comprehensive big data analysis platform have been built in the ancient tea garden to realize the full traceability of tea growth and refined management of the tea garden, turning traditional planting into a standardized and sustainable \"tea factory\" . Through in-depth surveys, protection and development of ancient tea trees, and the exploration of historical and cultural connotations such as the Ancient Tea Horse Road culture, tea villages and tea towns have also become popular tourist check-in destinations. In 2023, the comprehensive output value of Jiulong County Ecological Tea Modern Agricultural Industrial Park will be 70.83 million yuan, and tea sales revenue will be nearly 55 million yuan. Complementary advantages and resource aggregation will inject impetus into the industrial development of poverty-stricken areas.

Currently, 130 guitar production and supporting companies have settled in the park, with exports exceeding US$100 million for three consecutive years. Zhao Liang, leader of the Zunyi-based working group of the Guangdong-Guizhou Cooperation Task Force, said that this year will continue to invest 2 million yuan in cooperation funds to implement projects such as comprehensive promotion and exhibition of guitar culture, and increase support for the development of guitar culture industry in Zhengji. Strengthen labor docking and train vocational skills Strengthen labor docking and train vocational skills Ensure stable employment for people lifted out of poverty Ensure stable employment for people lifted out of poverty At Guangdong Xinbao Electric Co., Ltd., most front-line workers come from outside the province. \"I have been working here for four years, and my job has always been stable.\" Li Zhenlian, a 48-year-old assembly worker from Yuandong Village, Beishi Town, Xingye County, Guangxi, was promoted to a technician through skills training in 2021, and his current monthly salary reaches more than 5,000 yuan. In response to the employment needs of the rural labor force in the 99 poverty-stricken counties in Guangxi and Guizhou, Guangdong Province has established a \"one county, one enterprise\" rural labor stabilization employment base in both directions through east-west collaboration, highlighting the role of long-term recruitment and continuous job stabilization. \"We have established labor cooperation relationships with many counties in Guangxi and Guizhou to promote targeted employment of people who have been lifted out of poverty.\" said Ma Jing, manager of the Human Resources Center Office of Xinbao Electric Company.

The relevant person in charge of the Regional Cooperation Promotion Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said that after years of assistance, poverty-stricken areas have made great progress, but the overall level still lags behind. In addition, some labor forces who have been lifted out of poverty have insufficient skills, and more assistance is needed. Li Qiusheng, director of the Shandong Provincial Counterpart Support Office, said that in the past three years, Lugan and Gansu provinces have focused on brand building and established the Lugan “Artisan Alliance” to target rural migrant laborers, rural “second-generation students”, unemployed college graduates, and returning farmers.

The owner, Ma Wendong, participated in the \"Lanzhou Ramen Master\" training organized by the local social affairs department two years ago. After returning to the village, he opened a farm noodle shop and created employment for 12 rural laborers. At present, Lugan and Gansu provinces have collaborated to develop a number of special vocational training projects such as Lanzhou Ramen Master, Linxia Brick Carving, and Dongxiang Embroiderer. A total of about 40,000 people have been trained, and the employment rate has stabilized at more than 90%. Employment is the foundation of people's livelihood. As of the end of November 2023, the number of people lifted out of poverty nationwide was 32.939 million, exceeding the annual target of 2.747 million, stabilizing the income of more than 60% of the people lifted out of poverty. This year, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs will work with the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security to implement in-depth efforts to prevent people from returning to poverty and ensure that the number of employed people who have been lifted out of poverty remains stable at more than 30 million people. The relevant person in charge of the Regional Cooperation Promotion Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said that in terms of stabilizing the scale of migrant work, it is necessary to further give play to the role of the east-west labor cooperation mechanism, urge the eastern provinces to implement assistance responsibilities, increase the cultivation of rural craftsmen and labor brands in poverty-stricken areas, and strive to The labor force that has been lifted out of poverty is stable in their jobs, enterprises, and local areas, and their ability to promote employment is improved; the central and western regions are urged to implement the main responsibilities, strengthen the docking of labor services, and improve the degree of organization of labor export.

In the past two years, Shandong-Chongqing cooperation has innovatively carried out activities for village party secretaries to go to Shandong to learn from experience. Chongqing City has selected a total of 660 village party organization secretaries from 14 districts and counties to work in villages (communities) with strong comprehensive strength in paired cities in Shandong Province. “Focusing on aspects such as industrial revitalization, rural governance, and environmental improvement, Shandong and Chongqing have jointly agreed to receive villages and arrange one-on-one training locations and positions.

Last year, the village's collective economic income exceeded 200,000 yuan. In addition to grassroots governance, \"group-based\" assistance for cadres and talents in medical, education and other fields also continues to meet the all-round development needs of collaborative areas.
