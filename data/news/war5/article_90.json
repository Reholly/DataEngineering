    "text": "Call of Duty: Warzone's massive arsenal of guns features a wide array of choices, but assault rifles and LMGs are king, especially when it comes to guns like our best Holger 556 loadout in Warzone. One of the best assault rifles in CoD: Modern Warfare 3, the Holger 556 translates pretty well into Warzone as either a mid-range or long-range option depending on what attachments you put on it. It's a highly flexible gun that caters to different playstyles, making it a strong option in the meta. Here are the attachments we love to use in the best Holger 556 loadout in Warzone. Best Holger 556 loadout in Warzone Long-range damage. Screenshot by Dot Esports After a buff in Season One Reloaded, the Holger 556 is a pretty good option in Warzone, and there are multiple ways to use it thanks to its flexibility. It's decent at long-range but will often struggle against LMGs. Best Holger 556 build in Warzone Muzzle: VT-7 Spiritfire Suppressor Barrel: Chrios-6 Match Optic: Corio Eagleseye 2.5x Underbarrel: Bruen Heavy Support Grip Magazine: 40 Round Mag The Holger 556 can hold its own at long-range now, thanks to some buffs. The Chrios-6 Match barrel is the key here, which buffs its Bullet Velocity & Range, which is a must for long-range weapons in Urzikstan. The VT-7 Spiritfire Suppressor does the same, and the Corio Eagleseye 2.5x is the meta scope when it comes to long-range guns. This alternative build below, though, is an entirely different way to use the gun, and one that's still pretty fun. Excellent mid-range firepower. Screenshot by Dot Esports Muzzle: VT-7 Spiritfire Suppressor Stock: RB Addle Assault Stock Underbarrel: XRK Edge BW-5 Handstop Magazine: 40 Round Mag Rear Grip: Morn-20 Grip Alternatively, this particular build for the Holger 556 is a Sniper Support and really strong at mid-range, so it's best when paired up with either a short-range weapon or another long-range gun, like a sniper rifle in the other slot in your loadout. As for its attachments, these will help buff the Holger's Accuracy and Recoil Control, while adding more firepower with the 40 Round Mag. I like the VT-7 Spiritfire Suppressor especially, thanks to its ability to keep your red dot off of the radar when firing, and also providing a nice boost to Bullet Velocity and Damage Range. Best Holger 556 perks and equipment in Warzone Perk Package Perk 1: Double Time Perk 2: Sleight of Hand Perk 3: Tempered Perk 4: Ghost Secondary weapon: KATT-AMR or WSP Swarm Lethal: Semtex Tactical: Smoke Grenade This perk package is a well-balanced attack that focuses on speed and survivability. Tempered will make it so you only need two armor plates to be at full armor, while Double Time, Sleight of Hand, and Resolute can help you move quickly and remain in the fight. The secondary weapon slot depends on how you use the Holger 556. If you're looking to snipe some domes in Urzikstan, the KATT-AMR is your best bet and the Holger 556 works great in the other slot as support. But if you want to slap a long-range scope on the Holger, then back it up with the WSP Swarm as your close-range option.",
