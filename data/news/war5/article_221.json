    "text": "The unique avatar of Mohanlal and his intense look has always created much anticipation among the superstar’s fans as they eagerly awaited the release of the trailer of Malaikottai Valliban. While it was hinted several times that the actor will be seen performing stunts like a warrior, audiences got a first-hand sneak peek into the same as the makers unveiled the trailer on January 18, a week before the period drama’s release. Malaikottai Valliban Trailer: Mohanlal is a rebel, messiah for the oppressed and wages a war against the British Raj Mallaikottai Valliban trailer opens up with sequences that set the apt tone for the intense drama, which promises to be a period actioner filled with treacherous twists and ample bloodshed. It takes you right into the era when India was controlled by the British Raj, the emergence of rebels, the traitors whose greed only fuels up the power of the controlling British Raj, and other challenges faced by the masses. The grand entry of Mohanlal in the teaser is definitely a treat for his fans as the rebel decides to fight the war and become messiah to the oppressed. Although the trailer is expected to set the mood for the film, it fails to provide any details about the plotline. Set across picturesque locales of Rajasthan, Chennai, and Pondicherry, the screenplay is co-written by P.S. Rafeeque along with Lijo Jose, whereas the music is composed by Prashanth Pillai. Speaking about the film, Mallaikottai Vaaliban is directed by Lijo Jose Pellissery and it also stars Sonalee Kulkarni, Hareesh Peradi, Manoj Moses, Katha Nandi, Danish Sait, Manikandan R. Achari, Hariprashanth M. G., Suchithra Nair, among others. Produced under the banners Century Films, Maxlab Cinemas and Entertainments, along with Yoodlee Films, as the latter marks their first collaboration with Lalettan, the film is slated to release on January 25, 2024 in multiple languages.
