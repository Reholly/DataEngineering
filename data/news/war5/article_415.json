    "text": "It is important for Ukraine's allies to support our country so that Russian aggression does not spread to other countries. This was stated by First Lady of Ukraine Olena Zelenska in an interview with Corriere della Sera, one of the most popular newspapers and information platforms in Italy.\n“After the Chornobyl explosion, when the outdated Shelter was gradually crumbling and there was a threat of collapse, the international community allocated more than one and a half billion euros for a new, safe confinement. It was clear to everyone that Chornobyl was located on the territory of Ukraine, but radiation would reach everyone in Europe in case of an accident. So it seems to me that after two years of full-scale invasion, it is already clear to everyone: the Russian invasion is like radiation that will spread far beyond Ukraine if it is not contained now. And it's not just about the literal invasion of Russia itself. Just as the civilized, democratic world is inspired by the courage of Ukrainians, dictatorships around the world are inspired by the example of Russia. They believe that they can seize neighboring territories and destroy nations with impunity. They believe that the world can be divided in a new way,” the First Lady noted.\nOlena Zelenska emphasized that now that Ukraine is successfully holding back the army of one of the most powerful dictators on the battlefield, the world has a chance to overcome this aggression.\n“And we can do it only together. And then all the aggressors in the world will see that war will not help them achieve their goals. Because the free world is still stronger,” the First Lady said.",
