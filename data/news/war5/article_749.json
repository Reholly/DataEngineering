    "text": "By Kazeem Ugbodaga\nImpressive Cape Verde have qualified for the round of 16 at the ongoing African Cup of Nations (AFCON) after thrashing Mozambique 3-0 on Friday.\nCape Verde now have six points and are Group B winner after just two matches. They will remain top of the group even if they lose their last match to Egypt as they are unassailable.\nBebe opened the scoring for the tiny Island country in the 32nd minute of the match. He sent the ball into the net from a long-distance direct free kick. It went exactly inside the right post.\nCape Verde doubled their lead six minutes into the second half. A mistake from the defence gifted a chance to a lurking Ryan Mendes, who kept his cool and rolled the ball into the net from close range.\nIn the 59th minute of the game, Geny Catamo took a mid-range free kick and his effort flew straight, but crashes against the crossbar.\nMidway into the second half, Cape Verde were 3-0 up. Kevin Lenini scored one of the best goals in his career. His rocket of a shot from distance went straight inside the left post.\nEarlier, Bebe tried his luck from a long-range free kick, but the effort came back off the crossbar.\nProvided by SyndiGate Media Inc.
