    "text": "Jordan Love and the Green Bay Packers are set to take on the San Francisco 49ers in the NFL Divisional Playoffs Saturday night . Whether Green Bay’s season comes to an end remains to be seen. But when it does, the Packers are expected to negotiate a long-term contract with the quarterback. NFL Media’s Ian Rapoport reports that Love is expected to receive a lucrative long-term contract that will pay him franchise quarterback money. Love, 25, has one more year remaining on his contract after agreeing to an extension last offseaon. His deal is worth $13.5 million next season with incentives that could pay the former first-round pick north of $21 million. He’s obviously outplayed that figure. The question here is Love’s value. He’s highly unlikely to receive a deal similar to what Justin Herbert signed with the Los Angeles Chargers last offseason (five year, $262.5 million). With one year of starting experience and without the sample size of Herbert or Cincinnati Bengals star Joe Burrow, any Love extension will end up being tricky. We could very well be looking at a deal similar to the five-year, $230.5 million contract Kyler Murray signed with the Arizona Cardinals ahead of the 2022 season. That is to say, a massive total figure with limited guarantees.

Over the course of his final eight regular season starts, the former Utah State standout tallied 20 total touchdowns compared to just one interception.
