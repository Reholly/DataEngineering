    "text": "Wanindu Hasaranga’s lower-order demolition eased Sri Lanka to a 2-1 series win against Zimbabwe on Thursday after the tourists were bowled out in Colombo for 82, their worst-ever T20 total.\nThe home skipper’s 4-15 included two scalps on his final two deliveries and Sri Lanka cruised to a nine-wicket victory inside 11 overs.\n“Today we bounced back,” all-rounder and ex-skipper Angelo Mathews told reporters after the win.\n“We have a very attacking captain who wants to achieve bigger things. He has created a good environment. That is the key.”\nPathum Nissanaka (39 not out) and Kusal Mendis (33) added 64 runs in 46 balls before a deceptive turner from left-arm spinner Sean Williams took the latter off-stump for Zimbabwe’s sole breakthrough.\nNissanka sealed Sri Lanka’s win by launching Sikandar Raza for six over long-on when the scores drew level.\nZimbabwe had a creditable start with 56-3 after the first six overs of power play but struggled to score boundaries once fielding restrictions eased.\nNumber three batsman Brian Bennett top-scored with 29 off just 12 balls, including four boundaries in the second over, before a Hasaranga catch off Mathews sent him back.\nBut a quick collapse saw the tourists lose their last six wickets for just 11 runs including three in the final three balls of the innings.\nSri Lanka’s fielding stepped up after a shambolic show in the second match handed them a four-wicket defeat and Zimbabwe their first T20 win in the island nation.\n“We didn’t turn up today,” Zimbabwe captain Raza said after the disappointing finish to the series.\n“When we needed courage and fighting spirit it wasn’t there,” he added. “There has been lot of good and bad in this series. We have been either really good or really poor.”\nHasaranga’s 4-15 was backed up with a return to form by ex-skipper Mathews, who shared the new ball and finished with two wickets.\nMathews had conceded 24 runs in the final over of the second match to gift Zimbabwe their come-from-behind win.\nOn Thursday marked the first T20 series win for Sri Lanka after a drought stretching back to their Asia Cup win in 2022.\nThey next host Afghanistan for a one-off Test and six white-ball matches.\nBRIEF SCORES\nZimbabwe 82 all out in 14.1 overs (B. Bennett 29; W. Hasaranga 4-15) v Sri Lanka 88-1 in 10.5 overs (P. Nissanka 39 not out, K. Mendis 33; S. Williams 1-13)\nToss: Sri Lanka\nResult: Sri Lanka win by nine wickets\nSeries: Sri Lanka win three-match series 2-1\nSri Lanka’s Wanindu Hasaranga celebrates after taking the wicket of Zimbabwe’s Tony Munyonga during the third and final T20I at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on Thursday.
