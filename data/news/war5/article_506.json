    "text": "The beginning wasn’t pretty, and the ending was downright scary, but there was enough good stuff in between to allow the Idaho State men’s basketball team to escape with a 64-59 win over instate rival Idaho at Reed Gym Thursday night.\n“Honestly, I didn’t feel good about our first four minutes and our last four minutes,” said ISU Coach Ryan Looney, “but everything else in between there was pretty good.”\nThe Bengals played poor defense and got in early foul trouble early in the contest, allowing the Vandals to build a 27-20 lead with 4:30 to in the half. ISU had three players, all of whom play the small forward position, in foul trouble with two fouls each n the period, the Vandals were a perfect seven for seven from the foul line, and Looney got hit with a technical foul for protesting too vigorously.\nYet ISU was able to go on an 8-3 run to close the halftime margin to 30-28, and re-establish some footing heading into the second period.\n“We had some big-time foul trouble, especially early in the game,” said Looney, noting that Isaiah Griffin, Trent Johnson and Briggs Ranstrom all had two fouls in the first half. “We just literally had to get through some minutes to get to halftime, so we could get our regular lineup back on the floor.”\nOnce they did, the Bengals went on a 14-0 run in the second half to build as much as a 17-point lead with 5:42 to play in the game. Maleek Arington was dispensing his usual magic at point guard, center Brayden Parker got hot at the free throw line, and Miguel Tomley and Kiree Huie joined the offensive parade.\n“At the end of the day, Maleek Arington is becoming a really good point guard,” said Looney, after the sophomore from Auburn, Wash. finished the night with 14 points, six rebounds, four assists and no turnovers while playing all 40 minutes. “We have nine turnovers in the last 80 minutes of basketball, and a lot of that has to do with him.\n“And I think everyone in our program has confidence that Maleek can guard the other team’s best player every team we play as well,” Looney added. “Those two things are giving us a chance in every game we play now.”\nUnfortunately, the Bengals reverted to sloppy late-game habits that allowed the Vandals to make the game much closer than it needed to be. One play in particular was disconcerting. With 23 seconds left and ISU up 62-54, the Bengals inbounded the ball against pressure, getting the ball in the front court to Trent Johnson. Instead of backing the ball out and waiting to get fouled, however, Johnson tried to make a spectacular dunk. He missed and came crashing down, clutching his knee at the end of the play. He later hobbled off the court at the end of the game, limping but under his own power.\n“That’s one of the mistakes we made at the end of the game,” Looney said. “We executed an inbounds play against pressure perfectly, we just needed to pull it out, get fouled, make some free throws and the\ngame would have been over right there. And then shortly after that, we blew a coverage on defense and gave them a wide-open three-pointer. Those two plays make the game a lot closer than it should have been.”\nBut the Bengals managed to hang on to claim their seventh straight win against the Vandals. Coupled with the ISU’s women’s win in Moscow Thursday night, it guaranteed that the King Spud Trophy, which goes to the school that wins the most men’s and women’s games in the ISU-Idaho rivalry each season, will remain in Pocatello. Since the Bengals won it last year, the worst they can do is split the four-game set this year, meaning the trophy will stay in Pocatello for another year.\nThe Bengals had three players beside Arington score in double figures, led by Parker with 18, including 10 of 13 from the foul line. He added eight rebounds, an assist, a steal, three blocked shots and did not commit a turnover. Huie had 12 points, four rebounds and three blocks, and Tomley had 12 points.\nGuard Quinn Denker led Idaho with 14 points, all in the second half, forward Tyler Linhardt added 13 and Julius Mims 12.\nThe Bengals improved to 2-3 in conference play, 7-11 overall, while Idaho fell to 1-3 in the league, 7-10 overall. ISU hosts defending league champion Eastern Washington, who beat Weber State in Ogden, 80-78 Thursday night, at 6 p.m. Saturday in Reed Gym.\nWomen’s Basketball: Idaho State 61, Idaho 56\nThe Idaho State women won their third Big Sky Conference game in a row, and their first on the road with a rivalry win in Moscow Thursday night.\nThe Bengals put four players in double figure scoring, led by true freshman forward Piper Carlson and guard Maria Dias, who both had 12 points off the bench. Starters Tasia Jordan and Nicka Lokica had 10 points apiece, with Jordan adding seven rebounds and Lokica five rebounds, two blocks and two steals.\n“The game lived up to how a rivalry game should be,” said ISU Coach Seton Sobolewski. “Hard fought on both ends.”\nIdaho State led 19-13 at the end of one quarter, 34-28 at half and 52-44 at the end of three periods. The Vandals outscored ISU 12-9 in the final quarter, as ISU went cold, hitting just two of ten shots in the final quarter, to narrow the final margin.\nCarlson has put together back-to-back solid performances off the bench, having scored 13 points and not missing a shot in ISU’s win over Sacramento State on Saturday. She has totaled 25 points on 11 of 13 shooting and seven steals in the last two games.\n“Piper has made huge strides the last two games,” Sobolewski said. “So fun to watch her develop.”\nThe Bengals played without forward Halle Wright, who fell ill on the trip. She practiced Wednesday night, but then got sick on game day. It’s unknown if she’ll be available for ISU’s game at Eastern Washington Saturday afternoon. Tip-off is 3 p.m. MT.\nThe Bengals hit five of ten three-pointers, one of their better efforts from beyond the arc on the season, including two of four by Lokica, who hit four of six from distance in the win Saturday over Sac State. ISU also had only 13 turnovers on the night, one of their better efforts in that category.\nSarah Brans led Idaho with 16 points, including four three-pointers, and Asha Phillips added 12 points. The Vandals outrebounded ISU, 41-35.\nWith the win, ISU moves to 3-2 in the Big Sky, 7-9 overall. Idaho falls to 2-2 in league, 9-7 overall.",
