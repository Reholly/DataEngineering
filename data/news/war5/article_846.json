    "text": "At the beginning of the new year, Dave Kovalchick traveled to Ukraine, the first time he was in the country since spring 2022, shortly after Russia invaded its neighbor. Kovalchick, a bartender with Cabarrus Brewing Company who founded the nonprofit [Blue Team International](https://www.blueteaminternational.org/index.php), which provides humanitarian aid to refugees and those in need, wanted to do all he could, yet again, to provide assistance to people struggling and suffering after almost three years of war. Kovalchick helped [organize a Ukrainian charity festival](https://independenttribune.com/news/local/to-ukraine-with-love-concord-bartender-works-to-deliver-aid-and-hope-to-refugees-people/article_eae14fce-7ce4-11ee-977f-d32cb4bfef15.html) at Cabarrus Brewing in November, which raised more than $12,000. This allowed BTI to purchase two medical evacuation vehicles, which were delivered from Poland to Ukraine in early December. People are also reading… As international attention has gradually shifted to the Israel-Gaza war, with many Americans focused heavily on the November elections, Ukraine is in dire need of sustained support, as Russia continues to routinely bombard cities across the country with unrelenting air strikes and after a promising large-scale counteroffensive has largely stalled. Since the start of the war in February, 2022, there have been roughly 30,000 civilian casualties, according to the United Nations human rights office, OHCHR, including more than 10,000 people killed and 19,000 injured. In 2024, roughly 14.5 million people will need “multisectoral humanitarian assistance” in Ukraine, including 3.7 million people internally displaced by the war, according to the [U.N. refugee agency, U.N.H.C.R.](https://reporting.unhcr.org/ukraine-situation-unhcr%C3%A2%C2%80%C2%99s-2024-plans-and-financial-requirements-summary) “A lot of volunteers leave in the winter months, so we decided this would be a good time to help due to less support being given,” said Kovalchick, who is staying in Odessa, in the western part of the country, far from the frontlines. “More and more people come to Odessa each day, so more resources are needed here.” He is staying in a small hotel room, owned by a church that he is working with. Kovalchick, who arrived in the country on Jan. 4 and plans to stay until the end of February, interacted with the Independent Tribune through Facebook Messenger over the course of a few days, as he provided updates and answered several questions. Kovalchick is collaborating with all sorts of groups including local churches, military personnel and nongovernmental organizations such as the Danish group [Foodforukraine](https://www.facebook.com/FoodforukraineDK?__cft__[0]=AZUuiFG-HvHDk0k2EM3KIvMyikR-W3_YvZpJkMH_Ew1l4YNcgqLlskc4fBG4qOhHS1vI0LhAzthYw81w0e0gEZniBrIkpaCNfIipCrO51QrgiSQo9cArJJiMBEyL8e_IBc4U4SeFBDzO7y-l-7cqSgB20ClsCE4PQh6ckMLTIDXrFNAEsfk98ON5qvRLg2dbGL8&__tn__=-]K-R). His current projects include renovating a home for elderly refugees in Odessa that has fallen into disrepair and building a new roof for 11 orphans residing in a home in Artsyz. He has enjoyed his interactions with the kids, who gradually opened up to him. “They’ve had a rough few years and shy away from strangers,” he said. “You can see they are weary of constantly moving around due to Russian attacks.” Kovalchick and other volunteers have also made [two trips to Kherson](https://www.facebook.com/dave.kovalchick/videos/1558326284925421), a major port city in southern Ukraine, to provide meals to people in need. They delivered 40 bags of food during the first trip and 200 bags during the second. Each bag costs about $6 U.S. dollars, he said, and can feed a single person for two weeks. A friend from Denmark is being backed by a food manufacturer called Danish Crown, Kovalchick said. They provide free meat while Kovalchick and others provide items such as flour, buckwheat, oatmeal, tea, beans, pasta, rice and tomato paste. He has also gotten involved with a program that provides food for 200 refugees at a time in Odessa and is working to send communication equipment and clothing to soldiers near Kherson. “The feeling of helping people is very humbling,” Kovalchick said. “The appreciation these people have is overwhelming, but it’s also upsetting in a way, knowing that others are left without help.” Kovalchick is aware of the risks he faces, as cities like Kherson, captured by Russian forces early in the war and liberated by Ukrainian troops in November 2022, are still regularly targeted by airstrikes launched by Russians soldiers stationed across the Dnipro River. “I’m playing the odds,” Kovalchick told the paper. “I know it’s dangerous, but it’s also dangerous walking around American cities with the crime. The feeling is ever changing. One day, I’m feeding the poor and watching a 10-year-old girl help her grandparents get a free meal knowing her parents were lost in the war…Then the next day, I see an apartment building destroyed and innocent people injured.” Earlier this week, Russia launched a drone strike on Odessa, injuring three people and damaging an apartment building. Kovalchick witnessed firsthand the aftermath. Brazen attacks like these against innocent civilians makes Kovalchick even more determined to do everything in his power to help. “Nobody was killed but many people lost their homes and belongings,” he said of the strike, “This is why I am here.” Despite the daily struggles and constant fear of Russian airstrikes, Kovalchick has found that people are still optimistic and have not lost hope. “Morale is high because they have not been defeated,” he said. “A citizen here showed me video of a highly populated area with people singing their national anthem as Russia launched a major drone and missile attack. They have no interest in being connected to Russia.” Ukrainians are especially responsive to him once they learn he is American. Ukraine has received funding from numerous countries since the war began, though the United States has by far provided the most aid. Since Russia’s invasion, the United States has committed $44 billion in security aid, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky having met with President Joe Biden several times in Washington and Biden making a secret trip to Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, last February. Biden’s proposal to send more than $60 billion in aid to Ukraine is in serious jeopardy due to political infighting. “When these people find out I’m from America, they get a look in their eye that I can’t describe,” Kovalchick said. “They look at Americans as if we are some kind of gift sent from heaven. It makes me proud to represent my country in this way and at the same time, I feel bad that my country cannot do more.” For people wanting to help, visit [www.blueteaminternational.org](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http://www.blueteaminternational.org/?fbclid=IwAR39YI2vS52hO5Cb49TJrxVKiYb2Qx6S8vFSlxqCDN8eoqJ05u8Ml_g1suI&h=AT2g0H_VI7PQc1JmlbIZiKAEvIY1KkoKDR42fyMVAmp4VS3ITf0Tcrav5F22ItWjpoVX8ueHsdLQv-yen6u7xaUpwpHpqughdU6Vx2YahBkjT8f5U0JinBMW9eO0bMC8Loxa&__tn__=-UK-R&c[0]=AT3Errb5Nt8XNhPP9UKEO6Qic1dplryRAgkLVSe12wnlnsHGFxKN9elgGBeUBaT7AMmaN5Qxm2tTq7rYl957Xxqy_u2HMYMJZeO1IwOS5dddDBVRSb3kEiS4nwnY8yQu3KGavxJM9DbMAz5tSEuaiKzVYTJBLBjsiV8ki9kBDIvWhBMq8Xa-OYO2geA8KB1cBS2hxUxJaDhzdQ) and click the donate button.
