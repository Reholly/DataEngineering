    "text": "The Nigeria Police Force has thwarted a kidnapping operation and rescued the victim amidst a tense exchange of gunfire. According to Mansir Hassan, the Police Public Relations Officer, Kaduna Police Command, the gunmen opened fire during the rescue of Segun Akinyemi, an Abuja resident, on Thursday. “The rescue mission unfolded on January 18, 2024, after the Kawo Divisional Headquarters in Kaduna received a distress call regarding a kidnapping incident originating from Abuja. “Operatives swiftly responded to the alert, discovering that the kidnappers and their victim were passing through Kaduna. In the early hours, at approximately 0010, the police intercepted a grey Toyota Hilux van with registration number Abuja RBC 90 DC. The vehicle, suspected to be transporting the kidnappers and their victims, was blocked by the authorities. “A tense exchange ensued when one of the kidnappers fired at the police officers in an attempt to escape. “The officers retaliated, resulting in a gun duel. Fortunately, Segun Akinyemi, residing at block 10, flat 2 FCDA quarters Area 3 Garki, Abuja, was successfully rescued during the confrontation,” Hassan stated. He further stated that the arrest of one of the kidnappers, identified as Chinaza Philip, 28-year-old from Life Camp Abuja, marks a significant development in the ongoing investigation. Presently, authorities are actively pursuing the three remaining suspects who evaded capture. The recovered items from the kidnappers include the victim’s vehicle, two Retay G17 model pistols, one Beretta pistol, ten 9mm P.A.K ammunition, and five 9mm special ammunition. Hassan disclosed that findings indicate that Akinyemi was abducted on January 17, 2024, as he departed from his residence. The police thwarted the kidnappers’ journey to Kano in a commendable interception. Commending the operatives for their courage, A.D Ali, Commissioner of Police for Kaduna State, encouraged persistent efforts to pursue criminal elements within the state. He further urged the public to utilize security agencies’ hotlines for swift responses to distress calls.",
