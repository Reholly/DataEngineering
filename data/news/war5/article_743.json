    "text": "SHILLONG: Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday said the last 10 years under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi have been significant for the development of the NorthEast with an unprecedented focus on infrastructure development and conflict resolution.If these 10 years for the North-East are compared with the 75 years after the country's Independence, then this decade will definitely be considered as the golden era of the North-East, the Union minister said while addressing the 71st plenary session of the North Eastern Council (NEC) here in Meghalaya.Shah said under the Modi government, not only has the distance from the North-East to Delhi and the rest of India reduced due to the creation of infrastructure, but the difference of hearts has also come down.The North-East, which was struggling with various ethnic, linguistic, border and extremist groups-related problems, has also had the beginning of a fresh and durable era of peace in the last decade, he said.\\\"We have always considered the North-East as an important part of India. During the time of Atal ji, by giving it priority, a separate ministry was created for the North-East and today under the leadership of PM Modi, the three mantras of 'Act East', 'Act Fast' and 'Act First' are being implemented. Along with this, impetus is being given to the North-East by giving priority to it in all the ministries of the Government of India,\\\" said Shah.In the 50 years of its establishment, the North Eastern Council (NEC) has increased the pace of development of the region by providing a policy-related platform to all the states and simplifying the solutions to their problems, he added.\\\"In these 50 years, more than 12,000km of roads have been constructed in this region, 700MW power plants have been established and many institutes of national excellence have also been set up under the guidance of NEC. Under the leadership of Modiji, the scope of NEC has been increased under the Act East Policy,\\\" Shah said.",
