    "text": "Thank you for reading this post, don't forget to Share! A member of Israel’s war cabinet broke ranks by declaring that only a ceasefire agreement will help secure the release of the hostages. Former army chief Gadi Eisenkot cast doubt on the terrorist group’s strategy of subduing Gaza and trying to eliminate its rulers, saying: “Whoever talks about absolute defeat [of Hamas] He is not telling the truth. The opposition politician’s comments were a veiled attack on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s policies. On Thursday, Netanyahu dismissed the US view that Israel’s military action should lead to the creation of a Palestinian state. He said Israel “must have security control over all territory west of the Jordan River,” adding: “That conflicts with the idea of [Palestinian] sovereignty.’ Former army chief Gadi Eisenkot questions the strategy of subduing Gaza Eisenkot told Israel’s Channel 12: “The hostages will only return alive if there is an agreement, linked to a significant pause in the fighting.” In the photo: Gaza City on January 6. Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed the US view that Israel’s military action should lead to the creation of a Palestinian state. Yesterday, the UK Foreign Office said: “A two-state solution, with a viable and sovereign Palestinian state living alongside a safe and secure Israel, is the best path to lasting peace.” Eisenkot told Israel’s Channel 12: “The hostages will only return alive if there is an agreement, linked to a significant pause in the fighting.” He said this would have to be “three or four times” longer than the week-long pause in fighting in November, which saw a limited release of hostages. He added that stating that they can be released by other means “is spreading illusions.” Eisenkot, whose 25-year-old son Gal was killed in the conflict last month, called for elections to be held soon so Israelis could deliver their verdict. He said: “Israel needs to ask itself… ‘How do we continue from here with a leadership that has failed us miserably?’",
