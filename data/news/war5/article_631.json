    "text": "Apple TV+ has dropped a new Masters of the Air video for the upcoming historical drama, which chronicles the bravery and struggles of a group of Air Force soldiers during World War II. The featurette provides a preview of the show’s epic scale and scope. It features commentary from the main cast and creative team, including executive producers Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg , as they discussed what is the show about. This marks Hanks and Austin Butler’s latest collaboration following 2022’s Elvis. The series will start streaming January 26. Check out the Masters of the Air video below ( watch more trailers ): “It follows the men of the 100th Bomb Group (the ‘Bloody Hundredth’) as they conduct perilous bombing raids over Nazi Germany and grapple with the frigid conditions, lack of oxygen, and sheer terror of combat conducted at 25,000 feet in the air,” reveals the synopsis. “Portraying the psychological and emotional price paid by these young men as they helped destroy the horror of Hitler’s Third Reich is at the heart of Masters of the Air. Some were shot down and captured; some were wounded or killed. And some were lucky enough to make it home. Regardless of individual fate, a toll was exacted on them all. Ranging in location from the bucolic fields and villages of southeast England, to the harsh deprivations of a German prisoner-of-war camp, and depicting a unique and crucial time in world history, Masters of the Air is enormous in both scale and scope, and a genuine cinematic achievement.” Based on Donald L. Miller’s 2007 book of the same name, Masters of the Air depicts the heroic actions of the men of the 100th Bombardment Group of the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. The ensemble cast includes Austin Butler as Major Gale Cleven, Barry Keoghan as Lt. Curtis Biddick, Callum Turner as Major John Egan, Anthony Boyle as Major Harry Crosby, Nate Mann as Major Robert Rosenthal, Raff Law as Sgt. Ken Lemmons, and more. The series is executive produced and directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga from a screenplay adapted by John Orloff, who is also producing. Executive producers are Tom Hanks, Gary Goetzman, Grahan Yost, Steven Spielberg, Darryl Frank, Justin Falvey, and Steven Shareshian, with Dee Rees, Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck serving as directors.
