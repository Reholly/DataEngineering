    "text": "Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone admits the fans inspired their Copa del Rey victory over Real Madrid .\nAtletico won 4-2 with two goals in extra-time at the Wanda Metropolitano.\nSimeone later said: \"We left the hotel for here and we found something wonderful that excites you and pushes you to continue working, seeing your people involved in even a second round of the Cup and so it is impossible not to give your heart, we interpreted the game better and we were better in extra-time.\n\"This victory is much more important for the people than for us, because it is only a quarterfinal.\n\"I always say that in football there are no deserves or revenge, it is a new game and a way of playing it. The three games were very similar. with us trying to play in a certain way and them, who are the best team in the world because they dominate all the records and that is why they win. It's not luck, they are very good, but we also compete well and that's why we win.\"\nHe added, \"The stadium, when we arrived, reminded me of the Liverpool game, which seemed impossible to defeat, but our people give us a lot of energy. Today after 1-1 was a complicated moment, but we continued working as we wanted, with Molina, Marcos' legs, Griezmann on the left, Jos√© incredible, Witsel broke it... The changes gave us vitamins and a magical footballer appeared like Griezmann.\n\"He won the duel against Vinicius and scored a great goal, we are lucky to have him and that he wants to be with us.\" Video of the day:\nAbout the author Carlos Volcano",
