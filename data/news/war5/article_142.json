    "text": "( MENAFN - UkrinForm) Germany and Ireland have confirmed their intention to continue supporting Ukraine in countering Russian aggression and on its path to EU membership.\nThis was stated by German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock during a press conference with her Irish colleague Micheál Martin, a Ukrinform correspondent reported.\n\"Putin deliberately continues his heinous missile terror against people in Ukraine for almost two years now. That is why it is important for us to intensively support Ukraine in its right to self-defense,\" she said.\nBaerbock thanked Ireland, which has taken over 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, 2% of the country's population. This, she said, clearly emphasizes Europe's solidarity with Ukraine, and Ireland plays a particularly important role in this process.\nRead also: Ambassador: Germany transfers new air defense systems to Ukraine this year \"Our support will continue for as long as people in Ukraine need it,\" she emphasized.\nIn his turn, Martin noted that both countries agree that the EU should continue to stand by Ukraine and support it on its path to liberation. He thanked Germany for taking the lead in supporting Ukraine in Europe.\nThe ministers also supported Ukraine's plans for EU enlargement, noting that this should go hand in hand with domestic reforms. In this context, Germany and Ireland fully support Ukraine on its path to the EU.\nMENAFN19012024000193011044ID1107741314\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the information “as is” without warranty of any kind.
