    "text": "Contrasting Claims on Women's Rights in Taliban-Ruled Afghanistan\nRohit Sharma Guides India to Victory in Historic Double Super Over\nA cricket match that was a spectacle on all fronts unfolded at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium as India faced Afghanistan in the third T20I. Marked by a top-order collapse, a remarkable recovery, two Super Overs, and a series victory, the match was a rollercoaster ride that kept spectators on the edge of their seats.\nRohit Sharma’s Unforgettable Knock\nIn a surprising turn of events, Captain Rohit Sharma, after two consecutive ducks, found himself steering the Indian innings from a precarious 22/4. Sharma, with his back against the wall, crafted a masterful 61-ball 121 not out, becoming the most successful century maker in T20Is with his fifth century. His performance was not just about the runs, but the timing and the situation, which made it even more special. Alongside him, Rinku Singh made a significant contribution, scoring a quickfire 69 off 39 balls, helping India to reach a formidable 212/4.\nUnprecedented Super Over Drama\nThe match was far from over, as an extraordinary conclusion ensued with not one, but two Super Overs – a first in international cricket. The first Super Over ended in a thrilling tie at 16 runs each, setting the stage for a second decider. India, under pressure, managed to secure the second one, scoring 11/2 compared to Afghanistan’s 1/2, thus securing a nail-biting 10-run victory.\nLooking Ahead: World Cup Preparations\nThe series served as a testing ground for team composition ahead of the World Cup. Despite the initial top-order collapse, the performance of players like Rinku Singh and Yashasvi Jaiswal provided glimpses of India’s bench strength. However, it was Rohit’s stellar century and astute captaincy that may have tilted the ongoing debate about the team’s lineup in his favour.\nComments\nSubscribe to BNN Breaking\nSign up for our daily newsletter covering global breaking news around the world.\n[]https://bnnbreaking.com/breaking-news/health/ghana-reports-significant-decline-in-childhood-mortality-rates-a-step-towards-improved-health-outcomes/",
