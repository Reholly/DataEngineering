    "text": "Thursday's EuroLeague action offered five Round 22 games: Anadolu Efes vs. Barcelona, Crvena Zvezda vs. Baskonia, ALBA vs. Bayern, Olympiacos vs. Maccabi, and Virtus vs. ASVEL. After two consecutive double-round weeks, the EuroLeague competition returned with Round 22 action. To kick things off, Anadolu Efes, coming off a sensational win against Virtus last Friday, continued its revival with a cruising 24-point victory over second-placed Barcelona. Rodrigue Beaubois dropped his season-high 21 points and dished out five assists. After that, Baskonia, led by coach Dusko Ivanovic, returned to Belgrade to take on former team Zvezda and secured a position in the Top 10. Markus Howard exploded for 17 points in the third quarter and finished with 32. Moving on to a German derby, where ALBA failed to claim consecutive wins for the first time this season, hosting Bayern. The latter team recovered after four consecutive losses in 2024. Later, Olympiacos, coming off two road losses in the latest double-round week, achieved redemption by comfortably beating Lorenzo Brown-less Maccabi. Nikola Milutinov recorded a huge double-double of 20 points, 20 rebounds, and 40 PIR. Lastly, two teams aiming for redemption from recent losses met in Bologna, with Virtus defeating last-place ASVEL. All EuroLeague matches are broadcast on [EuroLeague TV](https://euroleague.tv/home).
