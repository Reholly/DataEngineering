Later, Lt Gen Singh visited the Welfare & Military Pension Branch, a Polyclinic in Defence Wing at Kathmandu and appreciated the initiatives undertaken for veterans' welfare. He also inaugurated a newly built portion of the Bhartiya Gorkha Sainik Niwas, the Southern Command said. Earlier on Friday, the top Army official addressed 3,000 Gorkha Veterans, Veer Naris, widows & dependants at a rally in Pokhara. He also highlighted key welfare issues and honoured Veer Naaris & Gallantry Awardees. At the Pokhra rally, \"the General recalled the invaluable sacrifices of our gallant Gorkha veterans and affirmed the continued commitment of IA & GoI for their meaningful welfare,\" said another post from the Indian High Commission.
