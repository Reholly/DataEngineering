The holiday season was great for the cannabis industry. In 2023, Delaware, Ohio, and Minnesota passed recreational marijuana. More than half of U.S. population lives in places where marijuana is legal for recreational use with even more having access to [medical marijuana](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5312634/). The holidays are a time of indulgence and spending. Consumers defied expectations for spending in December. [Retail sales rose 0.6%](https://www.census.gov/retail/sales.html) in December from November, which was more than analysts expected. The holiday sales confirm marijuana is mainstream by the way the public spent on products.

Young adults not in college were even more likely to avoid alcohol. Nearly 30% of this group in 2018 reported that they did not drink beer, wine or spirits. The number was about 24% in 2002. Decreases in alcohol consumption by Gen Z coincide with an uptick in cannabis use, according to [numerous reports](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/why-gen-z-is-drinking-less). Is this a one-for-one trade in substances? Some signs point that way According to [BDSA](http://www.bdsa.com), a leading national data analyst company which covers cannabis, it was an important marijuana sales year. Already, the day before Thanksgiving is a banner year Comparing same 7 holiday days of 2022 to 2023 and they saw an average of a 19% increase year over year. The day before Turkey Day is known as Green Wednesday in the cannabis industry. It is also a large alcohol sales day and is known as Blackout Wednesday or Drinksgiving. But alcohol sales only saw 3.8% rise. “Christmas is historically a significant holiday for the legal cannabis industry, with the days leading up to Christmas bringing a sizable boost to legal sales. In 2022, the day before Christmas eve (12/23/22) saw the second highest daily sales total of any day that month, with daily sales totaling +38% higher than the daily sales average for December 2022.” shared BDSA. Edibles saw an even greater boost on the week before Christmas 2023. BDSA reports edible sales on the week before Christmas were +23% higher than the average weekly edible sales total for the month. This is makes sense as gummies are the #1 way people consumer – almost 49% of users say the use have a gummy.

[BDSA](https://theartofmaryjanemedia.com/category/bdsa/) Which State Has The Cheapest Marijuana Who doesn’t love a good bargain? Or bragging right for a good deal….well here is the best deals on weed Everyone loves a good bargain! Be it real estate or eggs, most people look at prices and compare. A third of people claim they’re the best bargain hunter they know (34%). In addition, 87% say they’ll carry money-saving habits with them forever. In fact, the reason prices in at 99, . 95, or . 98 is a psychological pricing strategy to make products appear cheaper than they are. This is based on the theory that consumers are more likely to perceive an item priced at $4.99 as being significantly cheaper than an item priced at $5.00, even though the difference is only one cent. So which states have the cheapest marijuana and gas? One of the top bargain is the hunt for cheap gas…Costco is a winner. Gas prices are very complex and a global market. And there is always a profit motive. One study found gas prices fall twice as slowly as they rise after a major change in oil prices. This means, for example, if it took four weeks for gas prices per gallon to increase 25 cents, it would take them eight weeks to fall 25 cents once oil prices returned to their starting level. With this information, here is the top 5 places to fill you tank at the best price. RELATED: [California or New York, Which Has The Biggest Marijuana Mess](https://thefreshtoast.com/cannabis/california-or-new-york-which-has-the-biggest-marijuana-mess/) - Oklahoma. $2.59 - Arkansasa. $2.63 - Missouri $2.63 - Mississippi $2.66 - Wisconsin $2.67 When is comes to marijuana, it is a bit tricky. Legal New York City mainly sales via a black market. They have over 1,500 unlicensed dispensaries selling products at a premium. [BDSA](http://www.bdsa.com), one of the top data analysts shared information where consumers can purchase the cheapest legal weed. It Is not surprising market forces push up New Jersey and New York with all the weed available from the black market. And some states put a burdensome amount of taxes on products which always drives up the price. RELATED: [The Most Popular Marijuana Flavors](https://thefreshtoast.com/cannabis/the-most-popular-marijuana-flavors/) Here is the list! - New Jersey $17.9 - New York $15.5 - Missouri $13.5 - Maryland $13.3 - Illinois $12.7 - Florida $11.1 - Pennsylvania. $11.0 - California $10.4 - Massachusetts $9.8 - Ohio $9.7 - Nevada $9.2 - Oregon $7.1 - Colorado $7.0 - Arizona $6.9 - Michigan $5.4 Price doesn’t always mean the best – it means a bargain. In the alcohol world, the most popular beers are at lower mid price and are perceived to have a good taste. This includes top-ranked Corona, joint second-placed Bud Light, and fourth-ranked Budweiser. So find your favorite and enjoy!
