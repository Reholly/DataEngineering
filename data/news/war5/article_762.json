    "text": "Following recent tensions between Iran and Pakistan, the foreign ministers of both countries have agreed to reduce tensions and strengthen relations. Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on Friday, January 19th, that Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian had a telephone conversation with Pakistan’s Acting Foreign Minister Jalil Abbas Jilani to discuss cooperation. However, Tehran and Islamabad have come to an agreement on reducing bilateral tensions following recent airstrikes. Reuters also reported that Jalil Abbas Jilani, Pakistan’s Foreign Minister, stated in a telephone conversation with Hossein Amir Abdollahian that Pakistan is inclined to cooperate with Iran based on trust and mutual collaboration. During this conversation, both sides also discussed the return of their respective ambassadors to their workstations. It is worth mentioning that Pakistan’s decision to reduce tensions with Iran came after a meeting of Pakistan’s National Security Committee, chaired by Anwar ul-Haq Kakar, the interim Prime Minister, in which the top military commanders, air force, navy, and heads of Pakistan’s intelligence agencies were present. Earlier, Jalil Abbas Jilani, Pakistan’s Foreign Minister, had also stated that Islamabad does not wish to escalate tensions with Iran. This comes in the backdrop of heightened tensions between the two countries over missile attacks on each other’s soil.",
