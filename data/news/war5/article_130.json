    "text": "Pakistan’s tit-for-tat response to the infringement of its territorial sovereignty by Iran has been well received. It struck terrorist hideouts in Sistan-Baluchestan, and Tehran has confirmed that the attack – carried out in less than 48 hours of the Iranian strike in Panjgur district – has resulted in the death of nine foreign elements. The operation codenamed ‘Marg Bar Sarmachar’ was targeted against fugitive organisations, Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF), who had taken refuge in Saravan, Sistan-Baluchestan, and continued to operate with impunity inside Pakistan. The restive border region of Pakistan and Iran has, of late, become theatre of action for elements bent upon disturbing not only the regional peace and security but also the relations between the two friendly neighbours\nIslamabad’s retaliation was on the cards as it took serious exception to transgression from the neighbouring state, and immediately called back its envoy from Tehran. It was followed by asking the Iranian emissary not to report back to Islamabad, who was incidentally travelling. These back-to-back stern responses in the diplomatic and military realms were meant to make a point that it was not expected from a friendly country like Iran, and Pakistan has zero-tolerance towards aggressive stunts from any of the countries against its sovereignty and integrity. Thus, the aggression received a proportionate and precise rejoinder, and that too in real time to put the record straight. The message should be clear not only to Tehran but any of the capitals that may dare think of taking Pakistan’s cool for granted.\nWith the quick-fix now on the blackboard, it’s time to mend the fences and ensure that no such trigger-happiness is there in future. In order to address the insurgency factor on the part of non-state actors, which is rapidly pulling state-centrism into a messy conflict, a high-powered commission is desired to suggest a consensual strategy to deal with such elements. It is no secret that vested elements are out to exploit the loopholes in geopolitics, and that trend must be stemmed.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, January 19th, 2024.\nLike\nOpinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.",
