    "text": "ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka stands in solidarity with the people of Palestine and will continue to support them in their quest to realize their inalienable right to Statehood, Minister of Foreign Affairs M U M Ali Sabry has said addressing a meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Non-Aligned Movement in Kampala, Uganda. “In my address to the NAM Committee on Palestine, I reiterated Sri Lanka’s continued support for a ceasefire in Gaza, provision of humanitarian aid and a lasting solution based on UN resolutions and 1967 borders Palestine,” Sabry said on X. “We must acknowledge that until everyone is safe, no one is safe. Until the Palestinians are safe, the middle east is not safe. Until the middle east is safe, the world is not safe,” Sabry said. Reiterating that non-alignment is the cornerstone of Sri Lanka’s foreign policy, Sabry said that “contemporary global crises had brought the fragilities of the world to the forefront and that this has magnified the relevance of the Movement, as never before” according to a [Foreign Ministry statement](https://mfa.gov.lk/fmsl-addresses-meeting-fm-nam/). On the sidelines of the meeting, Sabry held bilateral discussions with the Foreign Ministers of Uganda – Odongo Jeje Abubakher, Pakistan – Jalil Abbas Jilani and Algeria – Ahmed Attaf. Sri Lanka was a founding member of the Movement and hosted the 5th NAM Summit of Heads of State and Government in 1976. The NAM consists of 120 member states is based on the Bandung Principles. Uganda assumed the Chairmanship of the 19th Summit of the Heads of State and Government. (Colombo/Jan19/2024)",
