    "text": "Dave Kovalchick, a native of the Tri-County area and founder of Blue Team International, started the year 2024 somewhere close to his heart –Ukraine. BTI is a nonprofit organization “providing humanitarian aid in many different ways to refugees and people around the world,” its website says. “Our recent efforts have been dedicated to the people of Ukraine suffering in the war with Russia. Blue Team has distributed food, medical supplies, personal hygiene items and other essential resources.” Kovalchick, originally from Sykesville, spent four months in Ukraine and surrounding countries in 2022, which motivated him to do more to help its people during this difficult time. He initiated the “Uniting for Ukraine” (U4U) program locally in 2023, which has matched several Ukrainian refugees with employment opportunities and host families in the Tri-County area. Kovalchick arrived in Odessa, Ukraine, on Jan. 4, and will be staying until the end of February, unless he can find a way to stay longer, he said. After several days in Ukraine, volunteers are focused on a few main projects, along with their continued food deliveries to Kherson. “There are other places our team will visit and see how we can help,” he said. House of Mercy “The House of Mercy” is a home in Odessa for elderly refugees. “The building is in good shape, but has fallen into a bit of trouble with some plumbing issues. I have discovered that we can restore this place for less than $2,000, and pay for two months of electricity,” he said. This is a great opportunity to support elderly refugees in Odessa, Kovalchick noted. Roof for Orphans “Roof for Orphans” is a project very special to Kovalchick. The house, located in the city of Artsyz, is safe from Russian attack, and orphaned children are living there. “They are cold, and the house has been damaged due to snow and rain,” he said. Kovalchick says he will not leave Ukraine until this project is finished. “I have been on site, and we have expert roof builders ready to do the work for free. We just need the funding,” he said. Widows in Need “In eastern Europe, especially Ukraine, the man can support his family with one income. When the man goes to war and loses his life, some women are left with no work experience and expected to raise children,” he said. Kovalchick is interested in supporting widows with several months worth of food from America. “These widows are supported by churches in the area with places to stay and supplies but they are in need of help, mostly with food.” Food for Refugees in Odessa Kovalchick has discovered a program which provides food for 200 refugees at a time, lasting six to eight weeks, he said, strictly for refugees and is by invitation only. “The food is purchased by wholesale, so the money goes further than usual,” he noted. The cost to feed one person for this length of time is $13.50. “The program usually provides food twice per month, but can no longer provide the funds. I have already committed to one round of food, and would love to do more,” Kovalchick said. Keeping the Troops Warm In addition, they have received many requests by troops near Kherson for assistance with communication and staying warm. Kovalchick said they are purchasing items such as “hot hand” packets and other devices to help troops communicate, like power banks for cell phones. “We also are looking into buying some higher end radio equipment for a garrison of troops stationed near Kherson who are lacking proper equipment,” he said. There are ways people from Kovalchick’s hometown area can support these initiatives.
