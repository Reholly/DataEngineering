    "text": "Youngsters dragged into the civil war in Burkina Faso are regaining their childhood in a secret care centre\nA brutal civil war has left many victims in Burkina Faso, many of them children drawn into the conflict as soldiers, sex slaves, and camp workers. This video, entered into the MPB Geographical Better World Video Awards, tells the story of two youngsters rescued and rebuilding their lives in a secret care centre. We published a\n full report on the Plan International centre in our August 2023 edition.\nIf you have a great story to tell about how we can make the world a better place, please enter your video. Whether it be a social media video or an ambitious short film, whether you are a young beginner filmmaker or an established campaigning group, we want to share your stories, which inspire and encourage others to help us tackle our urgent problems.\nWeâ€™ve teamed up with MPB, the global platform for buying and selling used photo and video kit, and world-renowned eco-resort Wakatobi in Indonesia, and we have some great prizes on offer. You have until the end of the year to enter. Find out\nmore here!",
