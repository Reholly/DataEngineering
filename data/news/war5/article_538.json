    "text": "Soccer Champions Senegal steam into Afcon last 16 with 3-1 win over Cameroon 19 January 2024 - 21:13 By Reuters Georges Kevin Nkoudou Mbida of Cameroon is challenged by Krepin Diatta of Senegal during their Africa Cup of Nations clash at Charles Konan Banny Stadium in Yamoussoukro.\nImage: Ryan Wilkisky/BackpagePix\nIsmaila Sarr scored one goal and laid on another as defending champions Senegal beat Cameroon 3-1 on Friday and booked their place in the round of 16 at the Africa Cup of Nations, leaving their opponents in some peril.\nSarr opened the scoring in the first half of the Group C clash in Yamoussoukro after a mistake by Manchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana, who was playing his first game of the tournament after a late arrival in the Ivory Coast.\nHabib Diallo added the second goal from Sarrâ€™s cross before Jean-Charles Castelletto scored a late consolation for Cameroon. Sadio Mane completed the scoring for Senegal in injury time.\nThe Lions of Teranga advance to the knockout rounds with a final group game against Guinea to spare.\nCameroon must play Gambia in their last match.\nBoth of those are on Tuesday.\nSenegal head the pool with six points from their two games, while Cameroon and Guinea have a point each and Gambia are yet to break their duck.\nThe latter two sides meet at the same venue later on Friday.",
