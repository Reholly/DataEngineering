    "text": "From [Gaza](https://www.shethepeople.tv/news/south-africa-takes-israel-to-court-what-this-means-for-gaza-2381149) to Sudan, Ethiopia to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Papua New Guinea to Haiti, and Russia to Ukraine, the world is going through a historic mass genocide. While it might seem like these issues are far removed from our daily lives, individuals around the world are increasingly seeking ways to make a positive impact. Emerging as a potent tool in this pursuit is the age-old practice of boycotts—a collective action with a proven historical track record as a catalyst for change. While social media stands as a formidable instrument for shedding light on atrocities and injustice, many are turning offline to a tried-and-true method: boycotting, as a means to wield collective influence. Let's delve into the history and efficacy of boycotts, questioning whether this form of [protest](https://www.shethepeople.tv/art-culture/iranian-revolution-feminist-rights/) can indeed drive social change. This is inspired by Janice Gassam Asare's article for [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/janicegassam/2023/12/22/do-boycotts-actually-work-examining-the-use-of-boycotts-to-drive-social-change/?sh=6902c1c5bbb5). The Anti-Apartheid Movement Apartheid, the system of \"racial segregation and white supremacy\" in South Africa from 1948 to 1994, faced a formidable opponent in the form of the [Anti-Apartheid Movement](https://www.aamarchives.org/campaigns/boycott.html#:~:text=The%20Anti%2DApartheid%20Movement%20began,heart%20of%20anti%2Dapartheid%20campaigns.). Starting with the Boycott Movement in 1959, international shoppers boycotted South African goods for nearly 35 years. This collective action played a pivotal role in dismantling the apartheid government in 1994. Montgomery Bus Boycott In the heart of the United States, the [Montgomery Bus Boycott](https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/montgomery-bus-boycott) of 1955–1956 stands as a testament to the power of collective resistance. Sparked by the arrest of Rosa Parks for refusing to yield her bus seat, the black community in Montgomery organized a boycott lasting 381 days. The result was the integration of Montgomery buses on December 21, 1956. Bristol Omnibus Boycott Across the Atlantic, in Bristol, the black population launched a boycott against the Omnibus Company and the Transportation and General Workers’ Union in 1963. Protesting the refusal to hire black employees, the boycott persisted until the bus company changed its policy in August 1963, leading to the U.K.’s first [Race Relations Act](https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/private-lives/relationships/collections1/race-relations-act-1965/race-relations-act-1965/#:~:text=The%20Act%20banned%20racial%20discrimination,later%20on%208%20December%201965.) in 1965. Delano Grape Strike In 1965, over 2,000 Filipino-American farm workers in California initiated the [Delano Grape Strike](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/delano-grape-strike-begins-ufw), a pivotal moment in U.S. labor history. Lasting five years, the strike and subsequent boycott of table grapes forced growers to increase wages, contribute to union healthcare, and protect workers against pesticides. The Swadeshi Movement In India From 1905 to 1908, India witnessed the [Swadeshi Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swadeshi_movement) and Boycott Movement, a direct reaction to the British government's controversial decision to partition Bengal in 1905. This movement was not merely a spontaneous outcry but a strategic response to resist British colonial rule. Its primary objective was to champion the use of products manufactured in India while simultaneously boycotting British goods. By embracing economic resistance, the Swadeshi Movement became a pivotal chapter in India's quest for independence, demonstrating a determined effort to break free from the economic shackles of colonial dominance. BDS Movement More recently, the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel has gained momentum. Launched in 2005, BDS is a [Palestinian](https://www.shethepeople.tv/art-culture/5-palestinian-fashion-designers-2022345)-led movement advocating for freedom, justice, and equality. Amid increased violence in [Gaza](https://www.shethepeople.tv/top-stories/what-is-israel-palestinian-conflict-about-gaza-strip-1557513), consumers are boycotting companies with ties to Israel, with reported impacts on market values, such as Starbucks and McDonalds. Assessing the Effectiveness of Boycotts While skepticism may exist regarding the effectiveness of boycotts, history speaks to their undeniable impact. The key lies in recognizing that boycotts should be part of a comprehensive strategy for social change. Coupled with actions like raising awareness, amplifying the voices of those affected, contacting elected officials, and providing tangible resources, boycotts can be a potent force for transformation. The Role of the Individual Research from Harvard political scientist [Erica Chenoweth](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190513-it-only-takes-35-of-people-to-change-the-world) suggests that only 3.5% of the population needs to participate to effect serious political change. Every action, no matter how small, contributes to the ripple effect of societal transformation. In the face of global challenges, individuals can find empowerment in knowing that their choices and actions, including participating in boycotts, can contribute to positive, lasting change.",
