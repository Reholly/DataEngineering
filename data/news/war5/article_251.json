    "text": "Roberta Metsola Is ‘Very Proud’ That EP Is ‘First Institution’ To Urge For A Permanent Ceasefire In Gaza President of the European Parliament (EP) Roberta Metsola stated that she is “very proud” that the EP has become the first institution to call for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza. “This is a necessary step on the path to lasting peace and stability in the form of a two-state solution,” Metsola told Lovin Malta. Yesterday, MEPs successfully voted for a [resolution](https://lovinmalta.com/ewropej-2024/meps-demand-a-permanent-ceasefire-in-gaza-on-condition-hamas-is-dismantled/) that called for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza on two conditions: that Hamas is dismantled and all hostages are released. PN MEP David Casa voted in favour while PL MEPs Cyrus Engerer and Alex Agius Saliba voted against because they maintain that such a ceasefire should be unconditional. MEPs Alfred Sant and Josianne Cutajar were not present for the vote. Metsola explained that this resolution serves as a “necessary step on the path to lasting peace and stability in the form of a two-state solution”. “We hope others will follow our push in finding a way forward that gives a real perspective to the Palestinian people and security for those in Israel.” Metsola went on to reiterate the call for the release of hostages taken during the “vile terrorist attack” by Hamas on 7th October and insisted that the group should not play a role in the future of Gaza – “that role must return to legitimate Palestinian leadership”. “The European Union will also continue to do all it can to ensure that necessary humanitarian aid reaches those in need, that international law is respected, and that accountability for any breaches exists. We will keep engaging with nations in the region to push the path of de-escalation.” “The resolution also talks about the need to address the situation in the West Bank and specifically how the EU can address illegal settlements and settler violence there.” “Even in the fog of war, the EU will keep talking about peace and about the day after. We are ready to help with the transition and rebuilding of the political perspective to peace.” Metsola didn’t provide the newsroom with a comment regarding the MEPs’ reasoning to vote against the resolution. This action was co-financed by the European Union in the frame of the European Parliament’s grant programme in the field of communication. The European Parliament was not involved in its preparation and is, in no case, responsible for or bound by the information or opinions expressed in the context of this action. In accordance with applicable law, the authors, interviewed people, publishers or programme broadcasters are solely responsible. The European Parliament can also not be held liable for direct or indirect damage that may result from the implementation of the action. Do you think that this resolution is sufficient?",
