    "text": "Palestinian groom Mohammed Al Ghandour wanted to give his bride a beautiful wedding but after war began in Gaza they had to flee their homes and the couple finally got married this week in the tent city where they now live.\nGhandour led his wife Shahad by the hand towards the tent decorated with some coloured lights and a mirror with a gold-coloured frame as a few relatives escorted them, clapping in time.\nInside the tent Shahad, wearing a white dress and veil with traditional red embroidery, lifted her hand and Ghandour put a ring on it.\n\"I wanted a party. I wanted a celebration, a wedding. I wanted to invite my friends, my relatives and my cousins, like anyone would,\" said Ghandour.\nThe couple are from Gaza City in the north of the tiny enclave where some of the worst of Israel's heavy bombardment and the fighting between it and Hamas have taken place since the war began on October 7.\nThe homes of both Ghandour's family and Shahad's family were destroyed in Israeli airstrikes, they said, and they lost cousins and other family members in the bombardment.\n\"My happiness is maybe at 3 per cent but will get myself ready for my wife. I want to make her happy,\" said Ghandour.\nInstead of the big party that Ghandour had wanted, he and Shahad had a small group of relatives who like them had managed to leave Gaza City and flee to Rafah, at the far southern end of the strip next to Egypt.\nShahad's mother led a small group of women ululating in celebration of the marriage and somebody had saved batteries for a small portable music player.\nFor a wedding feast in an enclave that the UN warns is heading towards famine, the couple had only a few snacks in plastic package, laid out carefully for them in the tent.\nBoth families had already spent lots of money on the wedding before the war began. Shahad had spent more than $2,000 on clothes, they said.",
