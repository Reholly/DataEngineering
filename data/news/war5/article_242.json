Glenn Phillips also charged the Pakistani bowlers and scored 70 of 52 with 5 fours and 3 sixes. Both players made a 139-run unbeatable partnership.\nAfter winning the toss, New Zealand put Pakistan to bat today (Friday).\nMen in Green failed to post a mammoth total to ensur its victory in the 4th match of the T20 against New Zealand.\nRizwan scored 90 off 63 ensuring to tighten his grip on the innings.\nPakistani skipper, Shaheen Afridi said the team is preparing for World Cup requiring the right combination.
