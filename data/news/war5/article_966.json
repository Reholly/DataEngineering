    "text": "By Kazeem Ugbodaga\nThe Teranga Lions of Senegal on Friday devoured the Indomitable Lions of Cameroon 3-1 to reach the knockout stage of the ongoing African Cup of Nations (AFCON).\nThe Teranga Lions who are the defending champions dominated the game from the beginning to the end and easily outclassed the Cameroonian side.\nIsmaila Sarr opened the scoring for the Teranga Lions. He was was in the right place at the right time to get to the rebound inside the box and gleefully rifled the ball low inside the right post.\nThe Senegalise doubled their lead in the 71st minute of the game. Sarr laid the ball off to Habib Diallo, who slotted the ball into the back of the net from close range, leaving the goalkeeper helpless.\nCameroon pulled one back seven minutes to the end of the game. Olivier Ntcham put the ball on the head of Jean-Charles Castelletto, who had the easy task to score into an empty net to make it 2-1.\nCameroon mounted the pressure to equalise, but it was the Snegalise which added another goal.\nSadio Mane scored with a wonderful piece of finishing. He made a yard for himself after a well-taken pass inside the box and struck the ball into the bottom left corner.\nProvided by SyndiGate Media Inc. (Syndigate.info).",
