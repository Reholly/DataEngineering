    "text": "By Ayaz Gul\nPakistan and Iran agreed on Friday to ease tensions and restore full diplomatic ties after their armies carried out unprecedented air strikes against alleged terrorist camps in each other's territory this week.\nAccording to the Pakistani Foreign Ministry, the agreement stemmed from a telephone conversation held by Foreign Minister Jalil Abbas Jilani with his Iranian counterpart Hossein Amir-Abdullahian.\n“The two Foreign Ministers agreed that working-level cooperation and close coordination should be strengthened on counter-terrorism and other aspects of mutual concern. They also agreed to de-escalate the situation,” the statement said.\nThe chief diplomats also discussed the return of the ambassadors of the two countries to their respective capitals.\nThe conflict began on Tuesday when Iranian security forces launched “missile and drone attacks” against targets of the anti-Iranian militant group, Jaish al-Adl (Army of Justice), in the southwestern Pakistani border province of Baluchistan.\nPakistan condemned the attack as a “gross violation” of its territorial sovereignty and said that two children were killed and several other civilians were injured. On Wednesday, Islamabad announced it was recalling its ambassador from Tehran, asking the Iranian ambassador to leave the country and suspending all bilateral activities with Iran in protest against “unprovoked” cross-border infiltration. .\nOn Thursday, Pakistan carried out retaliatory air strikes against “terrorist targets” in the southeastern Iranian border province of Sistan-Baluchistan that were being used to launch attacks against Pakistani security forces in Baluchistan.\nIran said that at least nine “non-Iranian civilians”, mostly children and women, were killed in the Pakistani strikes.\nMutual cross-border infiltration by both countries has led to an unprecedented increase in the usually tense bilateral relations. It also raised fears of wider instability in the Middle East following the outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas on October 7.\nJilani underlined the “close brotherly relations” between the two countries and expressed Islamabad's “willingness” to work with Tehran. [the] spirit of mutual trust and cooperation,” the Pakistani statement said. “They stressed that respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty should underpin this cooperation,” it said.\nThe Iranian Embassy in Islamabad said on its official are… ambassadors in the capitals” and mutual visits by the foreign ministers of Iran and Pakistan.\nMeanwhile, Pakistani caretaker Prime Minister Anwar-ul-Haq Kakkar chaired a meeting Friday with the country's top civilian and military leaders to discuss the crisis arising from tensions with Iran.\n“The Forum thoroughly reviewed the situation and appreciated the professional, calibrated and proportionate response by the Pakistan Armed Forces against the unprovoked and unlawful violation of Pakistan's sovereignty (by Iran),” a statement issued after the meeting said. Known as National Security Committee.\n“The meeting also concluded that in line with the universal principles governing the conduct of good neighborly relations, both countries will be able to resolve minor irritants through dialogue and diplomacy and pave the way for further deepening of their historic ties. Will pave the way.”\nMilitary tensions between Iran and Pakistan prompted UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, the United States and China to urge the neighboring countries to exercise restraint and reduce mutual tensions.\nThe Pakistani military said the strikes on Thursday hit targets in Iran that are run by the rebel groups Baloch Liberation Front, or BLF, and Baloch Liberation Army, or BLA. These groups regularly attack Pakistani security forces in natural resource-rich Balochistan.\nThe US has listed BLA as a global terrorist organization.\nTehran said that its drones and missiles targeted Jaish al-Adl positions. The predominantly Shia Muslim country blames a Sunni Muslim-based militant group for plotting the attack against Iranian security forces in Sistan-Baluchestan.\nIran and Pakistan share a nearly 900-km border where separatists, terrorists and smugglers have flourished for decades, with both countries accusing the other of not doing enough to counter security challenges.\nSource: www.eurasiareview.com",
