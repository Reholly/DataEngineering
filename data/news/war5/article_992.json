    "text": "2024-01-20 20:30:46\nHannah Gutiar, the wife of the Kurdish businessman, Beshro Dizi, who was killed in a missile bombing launched by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, on Erbil in the Kurdistan region of Iraq, recounted what she went through at the time of the bombing of their house, which Tehran claimed was the headquarters of the Israeli Mossad.\nAlong with her husband, her daughter was killed in the bombing, as well as a guest he had and his housekeeper, and their other two sons were injured:\nDuring a visit by an official Iraqi delegation to the hospital where she was receiving treatment for her injury, Hata Gutiar said: “We, as a family of five, live a life full of love in Erbil, and on the day of the fateful attack, the atmosphere was calm in our house, as I was on the top floor with two young ones, a boy and a girl. They were accompanied by two nannies, while my husband, Bishro, was with his friend Karam, who came from Baghdad, and my eldest son, Roj.”\n“After the meal, suddenly, as if in a dream, the roof of the house began to droop towards me, and I began to hear a quiet voice reciting verses from the Holy Qur’an. At that moment, I realized that I had read the Shahada, and I began to wonder about my existence and what was happening around me.”\nThe grieving wife continues: “An unfamiliar voice called my name, saying: Doctor, help us and get down, put your foot down. I thought for a moment that I might be among the dead, and in a flash, I found myself in a non-existent state.” Then she woke up to realize that she was in the hospital.\nLast Monday, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard carried out a missile attack on what it described as an Israeli “spy headquarters” in a neighborhood near the US Consulate complex in Erbil.\nIraqi and Kurdish sources denied the presence of a Mossad headquarters in this region, and Masrour Barzani, Prime Minister of the Iraqi Kurdistan region, said in a press conference while attending the Davos Economic Forum that “there is no reason to justify launching these attacks, and they will not go unanswered.”\nQasim Al-Araji, the Iraqi National Security Advisor, also confirmed, when he inspected the site of the attack in Erbil, that the allegations about targeting a Mossad headquarters were baseless.\nFollowing the attack on Erbil, the Iraqi Foreign Ministry summoned the Iraqi ambassador to Tehran, Naseer Abdul Mohsen, for consultations.\nIraq also lodged an official protest before the UN Security Council and the United Nations against the Iranian attack on Erbil, considering the attack a blatant violation of Iraq’s sovereignty and security.\n1705794665\n#wife #Kurdish #businessman #victim #Iranian #bombing #recounts #happened",
