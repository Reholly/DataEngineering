    "text": "In this capital, Lebanese organized a demonstration in support of Palestine in front of the South African Consulate to denounce the Zionist aggression in Gaza.\nParticipants supported bold positions calling for Tel Aviv to be held accountable and to take action, as South Africa did after suing the entity for its genocide against the Palestinians.\nUnder the slogan “Stand with Palestine…. the United States is the mother of terrorism”, Yemenis held several demonstrations in support of the Palestinian people and in condemnation of the US-British aggression against the country.\nIn a statement issued by the marches in the governorate of Saada in the north, the people reaffirmed that the imperialist attacks will not prevent Yemeni support for Gaza.\nIn this context, thousands of Jordanians staged marches of support in Amman and throughout the country, in solidarity with the Palestinian resistance and the people of the Strip.\nAccording to the pan-Arab Al Mayadeen channel, the attendees called for an end to double standards and the need to prosecute the occupation for its massacres against the Palestinian people and condemned the genocide in the coastal enclave.\nIranians raised Palestinian banners and flags, and chanted slogans demanding the international community to put an end to Israeli brutality in the Strip.\nIn the city of Qom, students of the religious Hauza held a vigil to denounce the silence of human rights organizations in the face of the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza.\nFor their part, the Bahraini people continued their popular movement to condemn the normalization agreement with Tel Aviv.\nCitizens demonstrated in the Diraz area, west of the capital, in support of Gaza and in rejection of the Zionist aggression.\nIn this regard, the Bahraini demonstrators demanded the immediate expulsion of the occupation ambassador from the country and the cancellation of the normalization treaty.\nef/arm/mem/ym",
