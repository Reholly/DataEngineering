The diary and documents were supplied by friends and relatives of Rabe who also gave their permission for it to be used in this book.\nThe book was written by John Rabe's grandson, German reproductive endocrinologist Thomas Rabe. \"Today is a very important day for the friendship of the Rabe family and China, which has been continuing for four generations and over 115 years,\" Thomas Rabe said in a video address at the ceremony.\nAfter reviewing his grandfather's experiences in China, as well as his own collaboration and friendship with Chinese medical experts, he said that the cooperation of the Rabe family over four generations with China is proof of a strong bond between the Rabe family and China, or between Germany and China in general, today and in the future.\nDing Bo, chief editor of Research Press, said the book not only records the history of the Nanjing Massacre from different perspectives, but also interprets the mental and emotional basis of John Rabe's feat back then, as well as the efforts made by his descendants to publicize his deeds and inherit his spirit.\nOpen Modal Ã—",
