The event, set to take place at the Abu Dhabi National Exhibitions Centre (ADNEC), is held under the patronage of Sheikh Hazza bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Deputy Ruler of Abu Dhabi.\nA Platform for Defence and Security Industry\nUMEX and SimTEX are recognized as significant platforms for the defence and security industry in the UAE. The goal of these exhibitions is to bolster local industry capabilities and lay a robust foundation for the defence and technology sectors. Unique to the Middle East, UMEX and SimTEX concentrate on drones, robotics, components, and unmanned systems, offering a glimpse into the future of warfare, where artificial intelligence and autonomous technologies reign supreme.\nEDCC’s Role and Participation\nThe EDCC’s involvement includes a dedicated stand showcasing innovative defence products. These products highlight the use of artificial intelligence and autonomous technologies, brought to life by entities such as the Ministry of Industry and Advanced Technology, Abu Dhabi Department of Economic Development, SAAB group, Canadian Aviation Electronics (CAE), and Avantguard. Mona Ahmed Al Jaber, Chairwoman of EDCC, underlined the council’s role as the national representative for the UAE defence industry. She noted that UMEX and SimTEX are crucial for spotlighting the council’s efforts to facilitate communication among defence contractors and foster opportunities for collaboration.\nEDGE Group’s Exhibition\nIn addition to EDCC, EDGE Group is set to showcase its leading advanced technology group in the unmanned and autonomous systems sector at UMEX and SimTEX 2024. The exhibition will feature a range of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles and unmanned ground vehicles, along with the participation of ETIMAD, a technology solutions and services company.
