    "text": "MINSK, 19 January (BelTA) – The Belarusian weapon industry has demonstrated its accomplishments many times over the last 20 years. Prime Minister of Belarus Roman Golovchenko made the statement during a solemn event timed to the 20th anniversary of the State Authority for Military Industry of Belarus, BelTA has learned.\nRoman Golovchenko said: “The Belarusian weapon industry begins the third decade of its history. It has lived through 20 bright years of establishment and development of the domestic military-industrial complex. Certainly, these years were not easy. They were not easy to forget. The USSR collapse put many Belarusian defense enterprises on the brink of disappearance. Yes, we made primarily high-tech products but those were only modules, components, parts, which used to be shipped to parent enterprises, which were located primarily in Russia and were in dire straits themselves. In these conditions the president of our country made the only right decision: to pull together all the assets, personnel, and competences and build a domestic defense industry under the guidance of one government agency.”\nThe industry’s work became systemic once this decision was made. The necessary legislation was worked out. Belarus had to create design and engineering schools of its own. “Most importantly, it was necessary to transform enterprises into a single organism united by a shared concept. It was necessary to address problems with personnel shortages and financial support, carry out retooling, organize manufacturing cooperation schemes inside the industry, and enable the creation of finished specimens of weapons, military and special hardware. We had to create our own things without losing scientific and manufacturing cooperation ties primarily with Russia’s defense enterprises. By enhancing the already available competences, the industry set the course for creating new weapons,” the prime minister added.\n“The Belarusian defense industry has repeatedly demonstrated its accomplishments to the country. The important milestones include the launch of Belarus’ first communication satellite, operational launches of the Belarusian multiple-launch rocket system Polonez. At present this R&D product is rightfully considered one of the world’s best MLRS in this class. Other achievements include optical and electronic equipment for space exploration, modern communication and control solutions, means and complexes for fighting against unmanned aerial vehicles. I am particularly glad to report that every enterprise operates independently and, within the framework of some holding company, they have some end products that sell well both inside the country and on the world market. Their parameters are on par and often exceed analogs. Half of the organizations belonging to the State Authority for Military Industry of Belarus are classified as scientific. It is quite remarkable, too,” Roman Golovchenko pointed out.\nAbout 1,200 R&D projects were finished over the 20 years of work. Virtually 280 finished specimens of weapons and special hardware have entered service with the Belarusian army and other military units. Over 110 objects of the manufacturing infrastructure and R&D infrastructure have been commissioned, reconstructed, or overhauled. Investments in the development of the enterprises are close to $900 million, with the merchandise export exceeding $11 billion, the prime minister noted.\nThe State Authority for Military Industry of Belarus is entrusted with important tasks of finishing the projects that are crucial to the defensive capability of the country and the technological sovereignty in this sphere of extreme importance for the state. A lot of work has yet to be done to increase the production of ammunition, firearms, unmanned aerial vehicles, to build up the capacity to batch produce goods. The accomplishment of another new goal – Belarus’ membership in the world club of aircraft manufacturing powers – depends on Belarusian weapon manufacturers, too. The enhancement and development of R&D partnership, manufacturing cooperation in the sphere of development and production of weapons together with the Russian Federation remain an important priority, the Belarusian head of government stressed.",
