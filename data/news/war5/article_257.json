We support the sovereignty and territorial integrity of both countries. We hope they will sign a durable peace treaty that recognizes such sovereignty and territorial integrity, the sooner the better,” Miller said. The parties have made significant progress over the past year, and we encourage them to maintain momentum building on past negotiations and conclude an agreement. Also Thursday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Baku is ready to sign an agreement with Yerevan on Russian territory.
