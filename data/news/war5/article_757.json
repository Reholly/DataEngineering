    "text": "2024-01-20 07:41:15\nA cat named Twix, thrown out of a train by a conductor in Kirov, died. 78.ru managed to communicate with a volunteer who was searching for the pet.\n— They just brought me a dead cat. I take photographs. “I can’t talk now,” said the grief-stricken volunteer.\nFive thousand people were searching for the cat. Kirov volunteers volunteered to help the woman. A group of activists was supposed to go out in search of Twix on Saturday morning, but the gathering was cancelled.\n“The gathering at 11:00 is cancelled,” they wrote in the telegram channel “Search for Twix the cat in Kirov.”\nA sad story happened a few days ago in Kirov. Twix was returning with his owner to St. Petersburg after undergoing surgery in the Urals. At some point, he got out of the carrier, but the woman, who had dozed off, did not notice. The train conductor mistook the cat for a stray and thought that he had run into the carriage at the stop. Without thinking twice, she threw the animal out of the train into 30-degree frost.\nThe cat’s “parents” were shocked. They promised a reward of 30 thousand rubles to the one who finds the four-legged pet. The owners want the soulless woman fired. However, they do not yet know whether they will file a civil lawsuit.\nThe press service of the transport police refused to initiate a criminal case under the article “Arbitrariness” against the conductor due to the lack of corpus delicti.\n“I also don’t see any crime here,” lawyer Vitaly Ulyanenko told Izvestia.\nUPD: 78.ru also managed to contact the husband of Twix’s owner. The man said he would provide information to the TV channel in the afternoon.\nRead more: In light of objections, Lebanon approves the 2022 budget 3 months before the end of the year\n1705739128\n#cat #Twix #thrown #train #conductor #Kirov #died",
