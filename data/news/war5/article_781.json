    "text": "DOWNEY ‚Äî A balanced attack and a physical defense from St. Pius X-St. Matthias allowed the Warriors to defeat rival St. Anthony 61-46 in a Del Rey League showdown Friday.\nThe Warriors, who stayed undefeated in league, were led by senior guard Tyrone Riley (San Francisco signee), who scored a team-high 17 points to go along with nine rebounds, four steals, and two assists.\nIt was a milestone game for Riley, who only needed to score seven points to reach 2,000 career points in his high school career.\nSt. Pius guard Tyrone Riley scored a team-high 17 pts with 9 Rebs and 4 steals to lead Warriors to a win\nHe has also eclipsed the 2,000 career point milestone for his high school career! @BeachVarsity @presstelegram @PiusMatthias pic.twitter.com/Pss1K084r2\n‚Äî Chris Camello (@Chris_Camello) January 20, 2024\nRiley said the milestone means a lot to him, as it was one of his many goals heading into this season.\n‚ÄúIt means a lot. I‚Äôve always been working (toward) that,‚Äù Riley said. ‚ÄúThat was a big goal I had on my dream board this year. (The) 2,000 points club, I knew I was close, but to find out I actually got it, it‚Äôs a big relief off my back. Now I (have) some more goals to get: Gatorade Player of the Year possibly, McDonald‚Äôs All-American, and MVP.‚Äù\nRiley wasn‚Äôt the only one who had a strong performance for the Warriors (18-4, 6-0). Center Douglas Langford dominated the paint and finished with a double-double of 12 points and 15 rebounds. He added five blocks and four assists.\nSt. Pius coach Donte Archie talks about the big win over St. Anthony, the great play of Douglas Langford and Tyrone Riley, and remaining undefeated in the Del Rey League at 6-0 @BeachVarsity @presstelegram @DONTE_ARCHIE @PiusMatthias pic.twitter.com/6fJpDZKYXV\n‚Äî Chris Camello (@Chris_Camello) January 20, 2024\nSt. Pius coach Donte Archie said the junior center‚Äôs strength is one of his greatest assets.\n‚ÄúHe‚Äôs big and strong, he doesn‚Äôt know how strong he is, he can be way more physical, but it‚Äôs a learning environment for him,‚Äù Archie said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs getting better at it, and we just have to keep enforcing him: be strong, be strong. When he‚Äôs strong, there‚Äôs nobody that can rebound with him. When the ball hits his hands, it‚Äôs not coming out.‚Äù\nThe Warriors trailed 20-16 after the first quarter. However, they quickly seized control of the game with their staunch defense holding the Saints to just six points in the second quarter. St. Pius took a 30-26 lead into halftime.\nSt. Pius X pulled away in the second half, leading by as many as 19, as it executed well on both ends. The Warriors‚Äô size and length were too much for St. Anthony.\nSt. Pius center Douglas Langford had a dominant game with a double-double of 12 pts and 15 Rebs along with 5 blocks and 4 asts üëÄ @BeachVarsity @presstelegram @PiusMatthias @DouglasJL4 pic.twitter.com/iHWv2xcEhd\n‚Äî Chris Camello (@Chris_Camello) January 20, 2024\nLangford said when the team‚Äôs defensive mindset changed, that‚Äôs when it took over the game.\n‚ÄúGoing into the locker room, it was just all defense,‚Äù Langford said. ‚ÄúWe need to pick up the intensity, we can‚Äôt be playing around with teams; we need to show them why we‚Äôre a top team in the state. We just locked in on defense and followed what our plan is.‚Äù\nWhile Riley and Langford did the heavy lifting offensively, St. Pius had several others who made key contributions.\nSenior guard David Mack and junior forward Tariq Bridges scored 10 points apiece and guard Tylon Williams added nine points off the bench.\nAfter scoring 20 points in the first quarter, the Saints (17-6, 3-3) struggled to score against the length and size of the Warriors. They scored just 26 points over the next three quarters combined and never got into any offensive rhythm.\nSenior guard Quincy Phillips was one of the lone bright spots, scoring a game-high 19 points along with six rebounds, two assists and two steals. Senior forward Chandler Young added 10 points and two rebounds off the bench for St. Anthony.\nUP NEXT\nSt. Anthony will host St. Bernard in a Del Rey League on Wednesday.\nSt. Pius X-St. Matthias Academy will play Roosevelt at Colony High in a nonleague game Saturday at 4:30 p.m.\nRelated Articles High School Sports | CIF-SS girls basketball polls, Jan. 22 High School Sports | CIF-SS boys basketball polls, Jan. 22 High School Sports | Press-Telegram‚Äôs high school boys basketball Top 10 rankings, Jan. 22 High School Sports | Press-Telegram‚Äôs high school girls basketball Top 10 rankings, Jan. 22 High School Sports | McFerson, Lynwood girls basketball team beat Long Beach Poly in top-five battle",
