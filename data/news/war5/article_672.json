    "text": "01\\/19\\/2024January 19, 2024 Benjamin Netanyahu rejects US call for a Palestinian state\nIsraeli Prime Minister has once again expressed his opposition to a to the longstanding conflict between Israel and the Palestinian territories.\nHe said a Palestinian state would become a launching pad for future\nNetanyahu said Israel “must have security control over the entire territory west of the Jordan River.”\nHe added: “That collides with the idea of sovereignty. What can we do?”\n“This truth I tell to our American friends, and I put the brakes on the attempt to coerce us to a reality that would endanger the state of Israel,” he said.\nThe remarks come after the US, Israel’s closest ally, called for steps toward the establishment of a Palestinian state.\n“Israel’s prime minister must be able to say ‘no’ when necessary, even to our best friends,” Netanyahu said.\nSpeaking Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the two-state solution was the best way to protect Israel.\nWithout a “pathway to a Palestinian state,” he said, Israel would not “get genuine security.”\nIsraeli President Isaac Herzog, also speaking in Davos, said that “Israelis lost trust in the peace processes because they could see that terror is glorified by our neighbors.”\nNetanyahu has also pushed back against US calls for a winding down of the conflict, saying on Thursday: “We will not be satisfied with anything less than total victory.”\n“Victory will take many months,” he added.\nThe post Israel-Hamas war: Biden still believes in two-state solution appeared first on Deutsche Welle .",
