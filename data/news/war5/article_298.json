    "text": "The UK Government has announced the first successful trial of laser\ntechnology against air targets, which could “strengthen the UK’s armed forces with greater precision while reducing reliance on expensive munitions”.\nSource: message\nBritish governmentquotes “ European truth“\nDetails: The DragonFire Laser Directed Energy Weapon (LDEW) system has fired a powerful laser weapon at aerial targets for the first time in the UK at a training ground in Scotland.\nThe government said the range of the DragonFire weapon is classified, but it is a “line-of-sight weapon and can strike any visible target.” They called it “an advanced military laser of the future.”\nThe British government added that the laser weapon “can boast pinpoint accuracy” equivalent to hitting a £1 coin from a distance of 1,000 metres.\nLiterally: “Directed laser energy weapons can engage targets at the speed of light and use an intense beam of light to cut through the target, resulting in structural failure or more dramatic results if the warhead hits the target.\nA 10 second shot costs the equivalent of using a conventional heater for an hour. It therefore has the potential to become a long-term, low-cost alternative to certain tasks that rockets currently perform. The cost of operating a laser is typically less than £10 per shot.”\nDetails: The UK’s DragonFire program is led by the Defense Science and\nTechnology Laboratory (Dstl) on behalf of the UK Ministry of Defence, working with its industrial partners MBDA, Leonardo and QinetiQ.\n“This type of advanced weaponry has the potential to revolutionize the battlefield by reducing reliance on expensive ammunition, as well as reducing the risk of collateral casualties,” Defense Secretary Grant Shapps said.\nDSTL chief executive Paul Hollinshead said: “These tests have allowed us to take a huge step forward in realizing the potential and understanding of the threats posed by directed energy weapons. With our decades of knowledge, skills and operational experience, DSTL’s expertise is critical to helping armed forces in preparation for the future.”\nDragonFire laser system from the British Defense Science and\nTechnology Laboratory (Dstl)\nUK government\nThe DragonFire weapon is the result of a £100 million joint investment between the Ministry of Defense and industry.\nContext: Nations around the\nworld are in a race to develop laser weapons powerful enough to melt steel. China announced in August 2023 that it had found a way to create laser weapons that can fire indefinitely. If true, it would give the country a lead in technology development.\nIn December, the U.S. Air Force and Navy asked Raytheon to design, build and test systems that would ignite enemy electronic components using energy blasts.\nBefore this, US President Joe Biden signed the National Defense Authorization Act, which provides a record 886 billion for defense needs in the 2024 fiscal year.\n2024-01-19 13:06:40\n#British #tested #laser #weapons #air #targets #DragonFire #hits #coin",
