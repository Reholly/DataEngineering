    "text": "Iraq Stun Japan To Reach Asian Cup Last 16, Iran Join Them\nMohammad Ali\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChaudhryMAli88\">\n(@ChaudhryMAli88)\n</a>\nPublished January 20, 2024 | 02:00 AM\nDoha, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 20th Jan, 2024)\nIraq coach Jesus Casas said his team were \"close to perfect\" in stunning Asian Cup favourites Japan 2-1 on Friday to reach the knockout rounds, where they were joined by rivals Iran.\nAymen Hussein scored two first-half headers in front of nearly 40,000 in\nDoha to consign four-time champions Japan to a first Asian Cup group-stage defeat in 26 matches.\nIt also set\nJapan on a potential collision course with Son Heung-min's South Korea in the last 16, assuming they still progress.\nCasas said that the first big shock of the tournament was \"only one win\" but hailed it as \"a great day for Iraqi people\".\n\"I think the perfect match doesn't exist,\" said the Spaniard.\n\"It's impossible to have a perfect match, but we were close to perfect.\"\nHussein headed\nIraq -- ranked 63 in the world compared to Japan's 17 -- into the lead in the fifth minute and struck again in first-half injury time. Iraq endured a nervous finish after Liverpool's Wataru Endo pulled one back in the third of eight minutes of injury time at the end of the game.\n\"\nAll the players were concentrating on this match and we were all ready for it,\" said Hussein, who also scored in a 3-1 win over Indonesia. Iraq won the Asian Cup in 2007 and are dreaming of upsetting the odds all over again.\n- 'Painful memory' -\nAlso Friday,\nIndonesia defeated Vietnam 1-0 thanks to a 42nd-minute penalty by Asnawi Mangkualam.\nIt means\nIndonesia and Japan will battle it out on Wednesday for the second qualification spot from Group D, although finishing third might also be enough.\nHajime Moriyasu's\nJapan beat Vietnam 4-2 in their opener and went into the Iraq game on the back of a 10-match winning streak in which they scored 43 goals. Japan beat Spain and Germany to reach the last 16 of the 2022 Qatar World Cup.\nBut they had no answer to the power and aggression of an\nIraq side roared on by most of the crowd at education City Stadium.\nHussein headed home for the opening goal when the ball fell to him after\nJapan goalkeeper Zion Suzuki flapped at a cross.\nHe notched his second just before half-time, holding off Hiroki Ito to nod home\nfrom close range.\n\"The atmosphere was like an away game and conceding early hurt us,\" said Moriyasu, but he refused to criticise the 21-year-old\nhttps://www.urdupoint.com/en/latest-news/suzuki.html, who was also shaky against Vietnam.\n\"For him and for the team it will be a painful memory, but I want him to embrace the challenge,\" said the\ncoach.\n-\nIran toil into last 16 - Iran joined Iraq, Australia and hosts and holders Qatar in the last 16 but they made hard work of beating Hong Kong 1-0.\nOn paper the fixture was among the biggest mismatches at the tournament, with\nIran ranked 21st in the world to Hong Kong's 150. Iran, hunting a record-equalling fourth continental crown, dominated possession in front of 36,412 at the Khalifa International Stadium.\nBut\nHong Kong -- playing at their first Asian Cup in more than 55 years -- had opportunities early on, especially when Brazil-born forward Everton Camargo blazed over from inside the box. Iran scored what turned out to be the winner in the 24th minute when Mehdi Ghayedi slid a shot across the six-yard box and past the despairing grasp of goalkeeper Yapp Hung-fai, the ball nestling in the bottom-right corner.\nRecent Stories\n<a href=\"https://www.urdupoint.com/en/sports/bowlers-impress-at-all-three-venues-in-fourth-1786993.html\"> 7 hours ago\n</a>\nBowlers impress at all three venues in fourth round of National Women's T20\nhttps://www.urdupoint.com/en/sports/pcb-introduces-retainers-for-women-panel-of-u-1786988.html\nPCB introduces retainers for Women Panel of Umpires\n<a href=\"https://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/lion-may-hide-again-to-see-public-passion-bi-1786969.html\"> 8 hours ago\n</a>\nLion may hide again to see public passion, Bilawal sarcastically targets Nawaz\n<a href=\"https://www.urdupoint.com/en/business/chinas-economic-resilience-in-2023-1786927.html\"> 9 hours ago\n</a>\nChina's economic resilience in 2023\n<a href=\"https://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/nsc-caretaker-cabinet-due-today-amid-pakista-1786914.html\"> 10 hours ago\n</a>\nNSC, caretaker cabinet due today amid Pakistan and Iran tensions\nhttps://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/cheezious-unveils-new-corporate-headquarters-1786913.html\nCheezious Unveils New Corporate Headquarters in Islamabad, Reinforcing Commitmen ..\nhttps://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/cipher-case-govt-challenges-ihc-decision-bef-1786910.html\nCipher Case: Govt challenges IHC decision before SC against Imran Khanâ€™s trial\n<a href=\"https://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/pakistan-has-no-interest-or-desire-in-escalat-1786890.html\"> 11 hours ago\n</a>\nPakistan has no interest or desire in escalating tension with Iran: Caretaker FM\nhttps://www.urdupoint.com/en/technology/punjab-governments-e-stamping-initiative-sur-1786880.html\nPunjab Government's e-Stamping Initiative Surpasses Rs 351 Billion in Revenue Co ..\nhttps://www.urdupoint.com/en/technology/vivo-y27s-a-visual-symphony-and-design-marve-1786873.html\nVivo Y27s: A Visual Symphony and Design Marvel\nhttps://www.urdupoint.com/en/technology/infinix-shines-as-the-most-innovative-mobile-1786866.html\nInfinix Shines as the Most Innovative Mobile Phone Brand at CES 2024\n<a href=\"https://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/un-chief-urges-pakistan-iran-to-de-escalate-1786831.html\"> 13 hours ago\n</a>\nUN Chief urges Pakistan, Iran to de-escalate & resolve all issues peacefully\nMore Stories From World\n-\nDefending champions Senegal beat Cameroon to book last-16 place7 minutes ago\n-\nFootball: Italian Super Cup result7 minutes ago\n-\nFootball: Asian Cup results and tables37 minutes ago\n-\nBoeing 747 cargo plane makes emergency landing in Miami47 minutes ago\n-\nTata Steel axes UK jobs as industry forges 'greener' future1 hour ago\n-\nFootball: Africa Cup of Nations table1 hour ago\n-\nHall of Fame golfer Jack Burke dies at 1002 hours ago\n-\nFootball: Africa Cup of Nations results - 1st update2 hours ago\n-\nFootball: Africa Cup of Nations tables2 hours ago\n-\n'Close to perfect': Iraq stun Japan to reach Asian Cup last 164 hours ago\n-\nTennis: Australian Open results - collated4 hours ago\n-\nSarrazin trumps Odermatt for prestigious Kitzbuehel downhill win4 hours ago",
