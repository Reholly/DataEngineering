    "text": "Guinea recorded a narrow 1-0 win over Gambia in their second Group C match at the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations (\nAFCON) on Friday night at the Charles Konan Banny stadium in Ivory Coast.\nThe result means the Syli National are on the brink of securing a place in the last 16 with four points in Group C, two points behind Senegal, after playing a 1-1 draw against former champions Cameroon in their first game.\nAguibou Camara scored the opener for Guinea fourteen minutes into the second half thanks to an assist from Morgan Guilavoguito.\nMohamed Bayo hit the post in the first half for a side who are aiming to reach the knockout phase at a third consecutive AFCONs.\nThe result leaves Guinea second in the group on four points, two points behind reigning champions Senegal who defeated Cameroon 3-1 earlier to clinch their place in the knockout phase.\nGuinea needs just a draw against Senegal in their next match on Tuesday to guarantee qualification for the last 16, but a victory will see them progress as group winners.\nThe Gambia, surprise quarter-finalists at the 2021 sit bottom in the group with no points and will face tough Cameroon in their last group stage match on Tuesday.",
