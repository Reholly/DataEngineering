    "text": "Research from the National Trust and Findmypast uncovered the storyPrivate Sydney Alexander Cross was shot when serving in Gallipoli in 1915\nSome might call it divine providence, others would say it was sheer luck.\nBut for Private Sydney Alexander Cross, the reason why he was saved from death by a whisker likely didn’t matter.\nNew research has unearthed the incredible story of how the First World War soldier survived being shot by a sniper when the bullet his pocketbook.\nThe lethal projectile hit his chest but stopped halfway through the pocketbook that was in his breast pocket along with photographs and papers.\nThe bullet made it as far as the words from the Bible’s 91st Psalm: ‘A thousand shall fall by thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.’\nAfter the brush with death in 1915, Private Cross, who was known as ‘Syd’, spent time convalescing at Devon country home Knightshayes Court, which had been converted into a war hospital.\nNew research has unearthed the incredible story of how First World War soldier Private Sydney Alexander Cross survived being shot by a sniper when the bullet his pocketbook\nAn article in Devon newspaper the Western News in February 1916 told how the lethal projectile hit his chest but stopped halfway through the pocketbook that was in his breast pocket along with photographs and papers. The bullet made it as far as the words from the Bible’s psalm 91: ‘A thousand shall fall by thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee’\nThe research, carried out by the National Trust in partnership with Findmypast, uncovered a newspaper clipping which featured Private Cross’s incredible story.\nHe was serving in the ill-fated Gallipoli campaign when he was shot.\nAn article in Devon newspaper the Western News in February 1916 said: ‘Out of the welter of war there come from time to time, like gold from the flaming furnace, glories whose throbbing interest thrills and amazes us.’\nIt added: ‘Pte. Cross was with our brave lads on the Gallipoli Peninsula, and one day, whilst on duty at Jefferson’s Post, a stray bullet, probably from a Turkish sniper’s rifle, struck him full on in the chest.\n‘In the ordinary way the bullet would have driven its silent message home, but fortunately Pte. Cross had in his breast pocket a pay book, a pocketbook and some photos and a few other odds and ends.\n‘Strange as it may seem these “scraps of paper” saved his life. The bullet, having pierced the books and the photos, came to a halt half way through a testament which he carried, and inside which was a booklet of texts given him by Mrs Drury, wife of Col. Drury, of Weymouth, on the regiment’s departure from England.\n‘The interest of the story does not finish there. By a curious coincidence (or do the Gods thus speak to man?) – the bullet penetrated the text book as far as, but no further than the following text: A thousand shall fall by thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.\n‘Strange message to come through the nozzle of a Turkish rifle, was it not? “A thousand shall fall by thy side.” They did. “But it shall not come nigh thee.” It didn’t.\n‘The bullet simply made a dent after the word “side” and checked its career.’\nPrivate Cross’s story is part of a new display throwing light on the soldiers, nurses, family and staff who were at Knightshayes Court, which served as a Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD) hospital during the First World War.\nPrivate Cross was born in Australia in April 1896 and served in several British regiments during the war.\nPrivate Cross is seen holding the pocketbook that saved his life by stopping a Turkish sniper’s bullet\nThe research carried out by the National Trust and Findmypast uncovered Private Cross’s military record\nHe returned to the front from Knightshayes in 1917 but was later discharged following a bout of malaria.\nData from the 1921 census reveals he later married wife Elizabeth and went on to work as a steward for the Cunard Shipping Company.\nLater records reveal that in 1926 he was serving as a dining car attendant on the railways. By the time of the 1939 Register he was a water in Battersea, south London.\nPrivate Cross was not the only soldier recovering at Knightshayes who made the newspapers after a remarkable escape.\nAfter the brush with death in 1915, Private Cross, who was known as ‘Syd’, spent time convalescing at Devon country home Knightshayes Court, which had been converted into a war hospital\nDescribed in the same Western News article as “a story of modern miracles”, Corporal Cooper from the South Staffordshire Regiment was wounded by a shrapnel shell which burst over his trench in Belgium in 1915, leaving him with 119 wounds.\nHe also went on to recuperate at Knightshayes.\nThe property, which was built for the Heathcote-Amory family, also served as a convalescent home for US troops in the Second World War.\nThe lavish listed property was built in the late 19th century. Conservative politician Sir Derick Heathcote-Amory, who served as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1958 until 1960, was the grandson of Sir John, who commissioned Knightshayes.\nKnightshayes is now cared for by the National Trust.\nThe Knightshayes opens to the public on Saturday, January 20 for weekends, and then seven days a week from Saturday 10 February.\nFor further information and opening times see www.nationaltrust.org.uk/knightshayes\nKatie Knowles, assistant national curator for the National Trust said: ‘At Knightshayes, which played an important role as a military hospital during the First World War, the 1921 Census has given us the chance to find out what happened to the men who fought, including family members and servants, as well as the nurses who cared for them.\n‘Some of the tales, such as the extraordinary escape from death by Private Cross, paint a vivid picture of individuals during the war but now we can learn more about their lives including the social and political changes that affected them.’\nJen Baldwin, research specialist at Findmypast, added: ‘The 1921 Census has already revealed countless untold stories for people across the globe.\n‘We’re so excited to work with the National Trust to delve into these records and offer new perspectives on the people who lived and worked at sites like Knightshayes.’",
