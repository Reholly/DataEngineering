    "text": "Frankie Collins scored 17 points and dished seven assists, and his six steals keyed a tenacious defense as Arizona State sent visiting Southern California to its fourth consecutive loss with a 82-67 decision Saturday in Tempe, Arizona.\nThe Sun Devils (11-7, 5-2 Pac-12 Conference) pulled out of a two-game skid with its most lopsided conference win, thanks in part to forcing the Trojans into 22 turnovers.\nArizona State converted those takeaways into 24 points, part of an aggressive transition attack. The Sun Devils outscored USC in fast-break points 27-11.\nThe Trojans (8-11, 2-6) scored only nine points off of nine Arizona State turnovers.\nJose Perez led the Sun Devils with 20 points, and every Arizona State starter registered at least eight. Jamiya Neal finished with 17 points and grabbed nine rebounds, Alonzo Gaffney scored 11 points, and Adam Miller finished with eight points despite shooting 2-of-10 from the floor.\nBryant Selebangue came off the bench to score nine points and grab a game-high 13 rebounds for the Sun Devils.\nUSC continued to play shorthanded, particularly in the backcourt with veteran Boogie Ellis and freshman Isaiah Collier – the team’s two leading scorers on the season – sidelined due to a hamstring injury and a hand injury.\nVincent Iwuchukwu recorded a double-double for the Trojans with team-highs of 14 points and 12 rebounds, while Kobe Johnson added 13 points. No other Trojans player scored in double figures.\nBronny James finished with seven points, five assists and four rebounds.\nUSC built an eight-point lead in the first half, but Arizona State outscored the Trojans 20-5 before intermission.\nUSC trailed the entire second half, twice cutting the deficit to three points before the Sun Devils responded with runs of 8-0 and 9-3.\nArizona State put away the game with a 17-2 burst spanning more than five minutes.\n– Field Level Media",
