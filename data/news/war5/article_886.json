    "text": "2024-01-20 18:56:12\nThey dominated, never trailed, but only took off at the very end of the game. Here is the paradox cultivated by the players of the France team against Iceland. The fault of a chronic lack of efficiency in front of the opposing goal in the first period, the Blues were closely followed by the Icelanders. They finally secured victory at the end of the game, with a seven-point lead thanks to a final goal from Nicolas Tournat (60th, 39-32).\nEarlier in the game, the French thought about taking off (22-16 in the 36th minute). But they conceded three consecutive goals in less than two minutes (22-19, 37th). The entire match was played at this pace: the Blues increased their lead, then conceded the points won in the process. “We had a lot of situations to play. But the efficiency can still be improved,” confirmed the coach, Guillaume Gille, at the end of the meeting.\nIn the game, French players showed great superiority. They affirmed it from the start of the game, through Ludovic Fabregas on the momentum of his previous matches. Like an oak tree in the middle of the opposing 9 meters, he was unmissable and scored three goals in eight minutes (5-4). This subsequently attracted the Icelanders onto him and opened up space at the back.\n“We performed well in all areas of the game”\nAn analysis shared by Dika Mem after the match: “Iceland defends hard but is quite wide. The pivots did a big job inside. » The right-back also hopes that this part will be “the basis of the France team for the matches to come”.\nAfter seven minutes without scoring in the first period, the Nordiques had nevertheless re-mobilized (15th, 8-5) and took advantage of the French team’s missed face-to-face encounters. Like Hugo Descat (2/4 shooting), the wingers often poorly exploited their counter-attacks. The second half was an offensive festival. France was sharper and ended up taking off.\n“We played a complete match, both in attack and defense,” confided Luka Karabatic. We performed well in all areas of the game,” said the captain. Still leader of its group and undefeated in this Euro, Guillaume Gille’s team continues its road towards the title it so desires. Their qualification for the semi-finals could even be assured on Saturday evening, depending on the results of the other matches in the group.\n#Euro #handball #French #team #dominates #Iceland #approaches #semifinals",
