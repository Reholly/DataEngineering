    "text": "Zelenskyy thanks UAE counterpart for assistance with prisoner exchange President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a phone conversation with President of the United Arab Emirates Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan to thank him for support to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity as well as assistance with prisoner exchange. \"Returning people home is a priority for Ukraine, that is why we count on further active role of the Emirates,\" Zelenskyy said on the Telegram channel on Friday. \"Ukraine is also grateful for humanitarian aid. Last week, we received a large batch – more than 1,500 units – of power generators. Such assistance is critical in the context of Russia's air terror,\" he said. The presidents also discussed a possibility of long-term financial assistance from the UAE and implementation of the Peace Formula. \"I told about the launch of preparations for the Global Peace Summit and invited the UAE to join the process. The voice of the Gulf countries is very important to us,\" the president of Ukraine said.",
