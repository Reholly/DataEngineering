Watch AFCON 2023 LIVE on beIN SPORTS | Sign up to take advantage of our 7-day free trial | AU | NZ\nBoth nations had failed to claim all three points in their tournament openers and were aware of the significance of this fixture towards their knockout stage hopes.\nAfter a goalless first half in Yamoussoukro, Camera made the breakthrough with 21 minutes left when he slid home from Morgan Guilavogui’s cross and it proved enough to move Guinea up to four points ahead of its final group game with current leader Senegal, which impressively beat Cameroon 3-1 earlier in the day .\nGambia boss Tom Saintfiet shuffled his pack with five changes made from its opening loss to Senegal, but chances were few and far between early on.\nGuinea almost took the lead in the 33rd minute, but Mohamed Bayo’s right-footed strike hit the post and it remained 0-0 at half-time.\nKaba Diawara’s Guinea continued to press for the opener and forced a number of corners before the deadlock was finally broken after 69 minutes.\nGuilavogui was the architect for the goal after he collected Ibrahim Diakite’s pass and cut back for Camara to poke home after he beat Gambia defender James Gomez to the centre.\nIt sparked jubilant scenes from the Guinea team and it was almost 2-0 moments later, but Bayo struck the crossbar from close range.\nEx-Liverpool midfielder Naby Keita was introduced late on and he helped Guinea hold on for a potentially vital victory to claim a semblance of revenge after Gambia knocked them out of the 2021 edition in the Round of 16 stage.",
