    "text": "Thousands of Yemeni people participated in mass rallies on Friday in support of the Palestinian people in Gaza, who have been facing an Israeli onslaught for over 100 days.\nThe rallies were called by the Houthi group in several cities and areas under its control, under the theme \"Firm in standing with Palestine.. US mother of terrorism.\"\nIn Sanaa's rally, Yemeni demonstrators chanted against the US-UK raids on Yemen and against \"Israeli genocidal crimes against the Palestinian people in Gaza\".\nFurther rallies were reported in Hodeidah, western Yemen, in Hajjah and Saada provinces of northwestern Yemen, in southwestern Taiz province, and in Al-Bayda province of central Yemen, according to the Houthi-run Al-Masirah channel.\nTensions have escalated in the Red Sea amid Houthi attacks on commercial ships suspected of having links with Israel.\nThe Houthis say their attacks aim to pressure Israel to halt its deadly onslaught on the Gaza Strip, which has killed at least 24,762 people and injured 62,108 others since an Oct. 7 cross-border offensive by the Palestinian group Hamas.\nThe US and UK launched airstrikes as of Jan. 11 against Houthi targets in Yemen in retaliation for the Houthi attacks, which have created fears of a new bout of inflation and supply chain disruption.\nThe Red Sea is one of the world's most frequently used sea routes for oil and fuel shipments.\n# Houthi Group # Operation Prosperity Guardian # Yemen",
