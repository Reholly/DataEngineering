    "text": "After the bombing incident at a Catholic Mass in Marawi last December, Muslim and Christian leaders have joined forces to condemn the use of religion for violence. In a joint statement posted on the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) website, religious leaders described the attack, which killed four innocent people, as a \"demonic act\" that \"defiantly contradicts both Muslim and Christian beliefs.\" They added that it must be \"under the guise of religion\" and should be \"condemned by the teachings of every religion in the world.” The explosion occurred at the Dimaporo Gymnasium inside the Mindanao State University (MSU) while there was an ongoing Advent mass for worshipping Christians on Dec. 3, 2023. READ: https://mb.com.ph/2023/12/3/explosion-rocks-school-gymnasium-in-marawi-4-dead-dozens-hurt \"The way of interreligious dialogue,\" religious leaders asserted, \"is the key to establishing a culture of peace, mutual respect, and understanding among peoples of all faiths.\" They have agreed to be “pro-active against similar terrorist acts” by imparting the true teachings of their religious traditions and sacred scriptures—the Qur’an and the Bible—to their followers. The statement \"Religions are for Peace\" was signed by 11 Muslim and seven Christian leaders, including Dr. Muhammad Nadzir Ebil, an Islamic jurist from the Bangsamoro Darul-Ifta, and Catholic leaders Archbishop Emeritus Antonio Ledesma of Cagayan de Oro, Archbishop Emeritus of Cotabato Cardinal Orlando Quevedo, and Archbishop Angelito Lampon of Cotabato. Their meeting was held in Cotabato City on Jan. 16 and 17, coinciding with the 10th anniversary of the Jan. 24 Peace Day.",
