    "text": "SEE IT: UK Tests Laser Weapon Called DragonFire That Can Shoot Down Missiles for Just $12 a Shot The technology 'has the potential to revolutionize the battlespace,' the UK Defense Secretary said [Dan Gooding](/author/dan-gooding) A laser powerful enough to [shoot down targets](https://themessenger.com/news/us-military-launches-another-barrage-of-missiles-against-houthi-sites-in-yemen) for the cost of running a heater for an hour was successfully tested by the British military, with sights now set on finally bringing the advanced tech into service. The DragonFire laser's successful test by the UK Ministry of Defense follows years of investigations and testing around the world, including [during President Reagan's term](https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ho/time/rd/104253.htm), when the technology was first floated as part of a way to replace nuclear weapons. While the range of the [laser](https://themessenger.com/news/israel-to-have-laser-defense-system-in-place-next-year-defense-contractor) is being kept secret, the ministry said it could hit a £1 coin - about the size of a U.S. quarter - from around 0.6 miles away. Firing the intense beam of energy, which can cut through metal, typically costs less than £10 ($12) a shot. \"This type of cutting-edge weaponry has the potential to revolutionize the battlespace by reducing the reliance on expensive ammunition, while also lowering the risk of collateral damage,\" Defense Secretary Grant Shapp said in a press release. \"Investments with industry partners in advanced technologies like DragonFire are crucial in a highly contested world, helping us maintain the battle-winning edge and keep the nation safe.\" The MoD said that the successful test, completed in Scotland, was a major step forward in bringing the technology into service after it was used to track moving air and sea targets previously.

DragonFire provides a step-change in our ability to deal with high-performance and low-cost threats.\" The United States carried out [its own successful tests in 2022](https://www.navy.mil/Press-Office/News-Stories/Article/2998829/laser-trailblazer-navy-conducts-historic-test-of-new-laser-weapon-system/), with the Navy also touting the technology's potential to cut costs and bolster the U.S.'s ability to [take out threats](https://themessenger.com/news/us-yemen-red-sea-missiles-shot-down-houthi-rebels-attack-gunmen-killed).
