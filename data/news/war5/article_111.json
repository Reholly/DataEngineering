    "text": "Global Crackdown on Press Freedom: 320 Journalists Imprisoned Worldwide, Says CPJ Report\nLarge-Scale Peace Rally for Palestine: Jeremy Corbyn Among Key Speakers\nA peace rally of significant scale is set to transform the city centre into a sea of solidarity for Palestine this coming Saturday. Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is among the key figures anticipated to address the congregation, which is forecasted to exceed 10,000 participants. If these numbers hold, the event could go down as the city’s largest protest in contemporary times.\nResponse to the Israel-Hamas Conflict\nThe rally serves as a potent response to the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict and the ensuing impact on the citizens of Gaza. Participants, donning placards and banners, are expected to converge from various local parks into the city centre, embodying a collective cry for peace.\nNotable Speakers and Speculations\nPutting a spotlight on the event, activist and musician Lowkey and political activist Salma Yaqoob are also slated to take the stage. Speculations are rife that Corbyn may use this platform to announce his future political plans, though this remains unconfirmed. Notably, around 20 Labour councillors from Birmingham City Council are planning to join the protest, a move that typically runs contrary to party guidelines.\nThe Rally’s Aims and Concerns Raised\nThe underlying aim of the rally is to demand an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and shed light on the humanitarian crisis born from the conflict. Jewish representatives within the local community, however, have expressed concerns about the tone of the demonstrations. They underscore the threat posed by Hamas to Israel and draw attention to the plight of Israeli hostages in Gaza. Ensuring public safety during the event, the West Midlands Police are actively engaged in dialogue with the organisers.\nComments\nSubscribe to BNN Breaking\nSign up for our daily newsletter covering global breaking news around the world.",
