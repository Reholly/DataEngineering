    "text": "ISLAMABAD: After the National Security Committee (NSC) meeting, Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar chaired the federal cabinet meeting on Friday and said it was in the interest of Pakistan and Iran to take steps to restore the relationship to what it was prior to January 16. He said Pakistan would welcome and reciprocate all positive measures from the Iranian side in this regard. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs briefed the caretaker federal cabinet about the situation arising from the Iranian attack on Pakistan, a the high professionalism with which the armed forces responded to the breach of Pakistan’s sovereignty and how the entire government machinery worked in unison in this regard. The cabinet also endorsed the decisions made at the NSC meeting earlier. Speaking at the cabinet, the PM affirmed that Pakistan was a law-abiding and peace-loving country and it sought friendly and cooperative relations with all the countries, particularly its neighbours. He said Pakistan and Iran were two brotherly countries that had historically enjoyed fraternal and cooperative relations, marked by respect and affection. The NSC, which met with Caretaker PM Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar in the chair, noted that Iran is a neighbourly and brotherly Muslim country, and existing multiple communication channels between the two countries should be utilised to address each other’s security concerns in the larger interest of regional peace and stability. The forum undertook a wholesome review of the situation and lauded the professional, calibrated and proportionate response by the armed forces of Pakistan against unprovoked and unlawful violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty by Iran on Tuesday. The NSC, however, reiterated the unflinching resolve that sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan are absolutely inviolable and sacrosanct and any attempt by anyone to breach it on any pretext would be responded with full might of the state. The meeting reaffirmed that the security and safety of the people of Pakistan is of paramount importance and no stone would be left unturned to ensure it. The PM had shortened his visit of Davos where he was attending the World Economic Forum, to chair emergency meetings of the federal cabinet and NSC in Islamabad in the wake of tensions at the Pak-Iran border. Caretaker ministers for Defence, Foreign Affairs, Finance and Information, Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, Chief of the Army Staff, Chief of Naval Staff and Chief of Air Staff as well as heads of intelligence agencies attended the meeting. During the meeting, participants were briefed about political and diplomatic developments bearing upon the prevailing situation between Pakistan and Iran and its impact on the overall security milieu in the region. The forum also took stock of the ‘Operation Marg Bar Sarmachar’, which was successfully executed against Pakistani originated Baloch terrorists residing on the ungoverned spaces inside Iran. An update on the situation along the borders and necessary full preparations done to comprehensively respond to any further violation of national sovereignty was also deliberated. The meeting impressed upon Pakistan’s commitment to sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries in accordance with the UN charter and international norms. The committee also reiterated the resolve to deal with the menace of terrorism, in all its forms and manifestations, with an iron hand. The forum also highlighted that Pakistan has suffered far more than any other country due to the scourge of terrorism. The meeting also concluded that in line with the universal principles, governing the conduct of good neighbourly relations, the two countries would mutually be able to overcome minor irritants through dialogue and diplomacy and pave the way to further deepen their historic relations. Earlier, the ice started melting between Pakistan and Iran on Thursday night with both sides reaching out to each other in the aftermath of deadly airstrikes in each other’s countries. Pakistan made it abundantly clear that Iran had to respect its territorial sovereignty as it did not want to “further exacerbate” the delicate situation. Ambassadors of both countries are also expected to return to their posts soon. In this regard, senior Pakistani and Iranian diplomats reached out to each other on Friday morning, with China, Turkiye, Russia and the United Nations calling for restraint and working behind the scenes. ‘Twitter diplomacy’ was also in play where senior diplomats from both countries reached out to each other while offering an olive branch with the consent of their bosses. This culminated late Friday evening with a telephone call between Foreign Minister Jalil Abbas Jilani and his Iranian counterpart Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, in which Pakistan said it was ready to offer closer cooperation on security issues and both ministers also talked about the return of ambassadors of the two countries to their respective capitals. “Underscoring the close brotherly relations between Pakistan and Iran, the foreign minister expressed Pakistan’s desire to work with Iran based on spirit of mutual trust and cooperation. He also stressed that respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty must underpin this cooperation,” said the Foreign Office. The two foreign ministers agreed that working-level cooperation and close coordination on counterterrorism and other aspects of mutual concern should be strengthened. They also agreed to de-escalate the situation. “Foreign Minister Jilani expressed Pakistan’s readiness to work with Iran on all issues based on spirit of mutual trust and cooperation. He underscored the need for closer cooperation on security issues,” said the Foreign Office in its statement. These engagements at different diplomatic levels came as Pakistan showed to the world that it would not remain silent and should not be taken for granted if anyone tried to damage its territorial sovereignty. Before Pakistan struck back on Thursday, it had publicly told Iran that Pakistan reserved the right to respond to the provocative act, and it did. When Iran carried out a missile attack inside Balochistan, it did not take Pakistan long to strike back on Thursday at “hideouts used by terrorist organisations namely Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF)” in Iran’s Sistan-Baluchestan province, in an intelligence-based operation codenamed ‘Marg Bar Sarmachar’. Earlier, when Iran had brazenly attacked Pakistan, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian had telephoned his Pakistani counterpart, who was in Kenya at that time. Jalil Abbas firmly underscored that the attack conducted by Iran inside Pakistani territory on January 16, 2024, was not only a serious breach of Pakistan’s sovereignty but also an egregious violation of international law and the spirit of bilateral relations between Pakistan and Iran. Expressing Pakistan’s unreserved condemnation of the attack, the caretaker foreign minister added that the incident had caused serious damage to bilateral ties between Pakistan and Iran. He added that Pakistan reserved the right to respond to the provocative act. “Stressing that terrorism was a common threat to the region and required concerted and coordinated efforts to combat this menace, Jalil Abbas underlined that unilateral actions could seriously undermine regional peace and stability. No country in the region should tread this perilous path,” the Foreign Office had stated. Earlier, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan called Foreign Minister Jilani to discuss the ongoing developments between Pakistan and Iran. “The foreign minister shared Pakistan’s perspective and the recent developments. He stated that Pakistan’s ‘Operation Marg Bar Sarmachar’ was aimed at terrorist camps inside Iran and that Pakistan has no interest or desire in escalation,” said the Foreign Office. Early Friday morning, Pakistan’s Ambassador Mudassir Tipu in Iran, who is presently in Islamabad, tweeted from his official account in which he highlighted Pakistan’s resolve to promote peace. “Pakistan has always stood by Iran through thick and thin. Cooperation and mutual trust between two brotherly countries, in a complex regional environment, is critical for peace & stability. Pakistan resolutely stands for its values to promote peace, stability and development,” he said. Meanwhile, Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan Reza Amiri Moghadam tweeted from his personal account pointing to the many times that Pakistan had supported Iran. “The two brotherly, friendly and neighbourly countries of Iran and Pakistan have always supported each other in different arena and hard times during the history. With common threats and interests, all-out potentialities and opportunities, the bilateral ties don’t tolerate any lag and delay,” he said. On Thursday night, a spokeswoman at the Foreign Office welcomed the Twitter exchange between senior diplomats of the two countries. When Iran had released a formal statement from its Foreign Office, Seyed Rasoul Mousavi, an Iranian diplomat on his ‘personal’ Twitter account from Tehran, tweeted: “I believe that the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country is the end point on the waves of tension created between Iran and Pakistan. Leaders and high officials of both countries know that only terrorists and enemies of both countries benefit from the existing tension between the two neighbouring countries. “ Today, the main problem of the Islamic world is to stop the crimes of the Zionists in Gaza,” he said. From Pakistan’s Foreign Office, Ambassador Rahim Hyatt Qurieshi, Additional Foreign Secretary for Afghanistan and West Asia, and a former ambassador to Iran, tweeted from his official account, which meant he had been given the green signal at the highest level. “I reciprocate your sentiments, dear brother Rasoul Mousavi. Pakistan and Iran have fraternal relations and shall move forward to resolve all issues through positive dialogue. It is imp[ortant] to restore trust & confidence that has always defined our bil[ateral] rel[ations]. Our common challenges including terrorism require coordinated action,” was Hyatt’s suggestion. Saleh Zaafir adds: Pakistan’s Ambassador to Iran, Muhammad Muddasar Tipu, has briefed the top officials about the state of ties between Pakistan and Iran. He said the sentiments in Iran don’t support hostilities against Pakistan. Ambassador Tipu assumed his assignment in Iran’s capital in August last year. Sources maintained that Pakistan is in constant contact with the friendly capitals in the aftermath of January 17th aggression. The sources hinted that the visit of any senior diplomat from Tehran in immediate future couldn’t be ruled out.
