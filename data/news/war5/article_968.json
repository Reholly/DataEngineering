    "text": "HARPSWELL (WGME) - Several storms left Maine coastal communities devastated over the last few months, which hit the fishing industry especially hard. Dilapidated wharfs, massive piles of plywood, debris scattered everywhere: this is just some of the aftermath of the storm’s impact on Harpswell last weekend. CEO of New England Fisherman Stewardship Association, Jerry Leeman, says these past couple storms have damaged some of the infrastructure that Maine’s fishermen rely on. \"Fixing these structures up especially here locally is going to be a pivotal point for keeping sustainable product on the American dinner table,” said Leeman. Senator Susan Collins met with a dozen fishermen in Harpswell Saturday to see the aftermath from those storms and the impact it is having on Maine fishermen. She says structures on Bailey Island here, that cost the town $10,000, were destroyed between both storms in January. \"I want to do everything that I can to try to secure assistance working with the governor, the local community, with the rest of the delegation,” said Collins. Leeman says 85% of this town is commercial fishing wharfs, these structures are vital to fisherman for their livelihoods. Some might appear to be in good enough shape, but fishermen say they need serious repairs. \"Just look at the wharf behind us here,” said Leeman. “Even though it's structurally still standing, if you go under it, that entire wharf has to come down.\" Collins emphasized how much this community and industry means to the state and its economy. \"It helps to attract millions of tourists; it helps to define our way of life. It's part of our heritage,” said Collins. Leeman is a fifth-generation fisherman and says it's painful to see this destruction. \"When you see things that were there when you were a child, and they're no longer there, it takes a piece of you,” said Leeman. Leeman says this is just the beginning and hopes this town can receive federal dollars to build back. This community is willing to do anything they can to help out their local fishermen. \"We don't stop. You just pick yourself up, dust yourself off and keep going,” said Leeman.",
