    "text": "The Indian shooters are continuing their stupendous show at the Paris Olympic qualifier events, as the country got two more quotas for the upcoming games, taking the overall shooting tally to 19. On Saturday, Anantjeet Singh Naruka and Raiza Dhillon not only won silver medals in the men’s and women’s skeet events, respectively, but also confirmed [Paris berths](https://www.insidesport.in/shooting/indias-rhythm-sangwan-secures-yet-another-quota-for-india-at-paris-olympics-2024/), at the [Asian Shotgun Championships](https://www.insidesport.in/shooting/indian-trap-shooter-claims-vendetta-against-india-at-paris-olympics-after-no-go-for-regular-gun-at-qualifiers/) 2024 in Kuwait City. This is for the very first time that India has skeet quotas in men’s and women’s at the Olympics. Not just that, India also surpassed the total number of quotas in 2020 — 15. As far as the Asian Shotgun championships is concerned, in the women’s event, Jinmei Gao of China took home the gold medal, while another Indian, Maheshwari Chauhan won the bronze medal. Unfortunately, Ganemat Sekhon finished fourth, despite ending second in the qualification round. But India also ensured, that on the basis of high qualification score from three girls, they bagged the gold medal in the team event as well.
