    "text": "On July 11, the U.S. Embassy held its first U.S. Independence Day celebration in Kapan. “ The people of Armenia deserve to live in peaceful and prosperous conditions. Hosting this special celebration in Kapan is a wonderful opportunity to advance our shared democratic values and strengthen the close ties between our people,” said Ambassador Kvien welcoming guests to the event.\nIn Syunik, Ambassador Kvien met with Governor Robert Ghukasyan to discuss possible ways to deepen Armenian-American cooperation and the United States' support for Armenia's sovereignty, territorial integrity, and well-being. The Ambassador also discussed the situation on the border with the EU civilian mission. She then met with Interior Minister Vahe Ghazaryan and representatives of the patrol service. First aid kits were provided to the patrol service. In Kapan, Ambassador Kvien met with persons displaced from Nagorno-Karabakh to hear about their current needs and to learn about the support provided by the Government of Armenia and USAID in their new places of residence. Ambassador Kvien also signed a new Memorandum of Understanding with Liana Gasparyan, Director of the Syunik Regional Library, on continued collaboration with the \"American Corner\" in Kapan. The Ambassador spoke with the participants of the ACCESS program English language course funded by the US Embassy. The program is implemented by the NGO \"Educational Initiatives\" in Kapan, Goris and Meghri. Ambassador Kvien's next stop in Syunik was the American company Contour Global Hydrocascade, which is one of the leading producers of renewable energy and provides 12-15% of the electricity consumed in Armenia annually.",
