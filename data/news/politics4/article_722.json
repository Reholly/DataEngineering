    "text": "Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban on Wednesday lauded Türkiye's role in peace efforts since the Ukraine war began, emphasizing President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's unique success in brokering a grain deal between Russia and Ukraine.\nOrban highlighted Erdogan's diplomatic achievements in a video on his social media account following their meeting on the sidelines of NATO's 75th anniversary event in Washington.\nHungarian premier described his own diplomatic visits to Ukraine, Russia, and China as a \"peace mission,\" and said his efforts continued by engaging with Erdogan.\nThe war in Ukraine has reached a brutal level, making peace initiatives essential, Orban stated.\nCommending Türkiye's \"indispensable\" role in peace talks, he noted Erdogan's unique success in negotiating the Black Sea grain deal. \"President Erdogan was the only successful statesman who was able to conclude a Russian-Ukrainian agreement,\" he added.\nDespite the significant divide between the warring parties, Orban stressed joint efforts by peace advocates could advance towards a resolution, asking the Turkish president to support Hungary's peace mission.\n*Writing by Yasin Gungor in Istanbul\n# Hungary # Recep Tayyip Erdogan # Russia # Ukraine # Viktor Orban",
