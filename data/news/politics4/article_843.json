    "text": "New transport secretary Louise Haigh has promised “the biggest overhaul to transport in a generation” and highlighted improving rail and bus services as her priorities in an address to Department for Transport (DfT) staff. But Haigh made no mention of aviation in setting out her “five key priorities” as she told DfT officials the department’s “new motto” would be to “move fast and fix things”. The transport secretary moved quickly to appoint a ministerial team, confirming former shadow aviation minister Mike Kane as aviation, maritime and security minister.

Haigh stressed her priorities would be “to begin work at pace on rail reform, further devolution of bus powers, ensuring infrastructure works for the whole country, and supporting local authorities to fix roads”. She set out five strategic priorities: to improve performance on the railways and drive rail reform; improve bus services and increase their use across the country; transform infrastructure, promote social mobility and tackle regional inequality; deliver greener transport; and better integrate transport networks. Haigh said: “Our department is clearly central to achieving the missions for government the Prime Minister has committed us to. “Growth, net zero, opportunity, women and girls’ safety, health – none of these can be realised without transport as a key enabler.” She told DfT staff that the department would “focus relentlessly” on improving performance on the railways and introduce “much-needed rail reform”. Lord Hendy of Richmond Hill has been confirmed as rail minister. Lillian Greenwood, MP for Nottingham South, has been appointed minister for roads, and Simon Lightwood, MP for Wakefield and Rothwell, has been named local transport minister.",
