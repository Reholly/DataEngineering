    "text": "Bayyah reiterated the Abu Dhabi Peace Forum’s commitment to the Rome Charter for AI ethics. “The involvement of peacemakers in framing artificial intelligence stems from the very essence of their civilising mission.” The Abu Dhabi Peace Forum has urged tech giants has been urged to involve peacemakers while framing Artificial Intelligence. Secretary-General of the forum Sheikh Al-Mahfouz bin Bayyah said incorporating peacemakers during the development of AI would go a long way in reducing the facets of danger and harm. “The involvement of peacemakers in framing artificial intelligence stems from the very essence of their civilising mission,” he said. Bayyah made the remarks at the closing session of a multi-religious conference held in Hiroshima, Japan under the title &quot;The Ethics of Artificial Intelligence in the Service of Peace: The World’s Religions Commit to the Rome Call.” Present at the meeting were Japanese Minister of Digital Transformation Taro Kono, President of Microsoft Corporation Brad Smith, President of Religions for Peace - Japan His Eminence Yoshiharu Tomatsu, President of the Pontifical Academy for Life His Eminence Bishop Buckleya and several figures representing the religions of the East. Bayyah quoted UAE President, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan at the G20 Rome Summit in October 2021 who said “Handling emerging technologies in a responsible and ethical way makes them a source of sustainable development, security and prosperity for all.&quot; Bayyah reiterated the Abu Dhabi Peace Forum’s commitment to the Rome Charter for AI ethics. He recalled that the forum was the first representative institution of Islam and the Arab world to engage in efforts that aim to establish legislative frameworks guided by values and visions to be a lighthouse and guide for AI developers. The Secretary-General also referred to the efforts made by the Religion and Civil Society Commission on Artificial Intelligence, which he chairs, in the United Kingdom and the path of partnerships and cooperation it has undertaken since its establishment in December last year. During his talk about the centrality of the vision of peace, Bayyah stressed that “there is no alternative to peace except annihilation.” He called for cooperation “to survive” no matter how widespread the wars were and how intense the conflicts became.
