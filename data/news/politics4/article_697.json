    "text": "Supreme Court Grants Interim Bail to Delhi CM Kejriwal in Excise Policy Scam The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) praised the Supreme Court for granting interim bail to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in the excise policy scam case. Despite the bail, Kejriwal remains in jail due to a subsequent arrest by the CBI on corruption charges. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| New Delhi | Updated: 12-07-2024 11:21 IST | Created: 12-07-2024 11:21 IST - Country: - India The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Friday celebrated the Supreme Court's decision to grant interim bail to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in the excise policy scam case filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), declaring 'satyamev jayate' (truth alone triumphs). Despite this relief, Kejriwal, who is also the AAP's national convenor, will remain incarcerated as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had subsequently arrested him over corruption allegations linked to the same purported scam. The apex court acknowledged Kejriwal's time spent in custody, noting that he has been imprisoned for over 90 days. (Disclaimer: With inputs from agencies.)
