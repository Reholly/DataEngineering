Russia's offensive in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv stalled out. Russia is continuing to throw wave after wave of men into the fight, making incremental gains at astonishing human and financial cost. By and large, the front lines have stabilized,\" Sullivan said.\nUkrainian mobilization efforts have improved. Ukrainian units are building stronger fortifications and defensive lines, and day by day, they're pushing back, he said.\nNational Security Advisor Jake Sullivan National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan speaks at the NATO summit in Washington, July 11, 2024.

But it's also due to the support of the United States and nations around the world, including NATO allies,\" Sullivan said.\nThe national security advisor said over the last few months, the United States has surged air defense systems, artillery rounds and long-range missiles.\nThe Ukrainians are employing these weapons with good effect in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, including in Crimea,\" he said.\nTraining Time U.S. and Norwegian soldiers train Ukrainian artillerymen on using an M109 self-propelled howitzer at Grafenwoehr Training Area, Germany, May 12, 2022. The U.S. and Norwegian soldiers trained the Ukrainian artillerymen on the howitzers as part of security assistance packages from their respective countries.

Spencer Rhodes, Army VIRIN: 220512-Z-EG775-294\nAllies have committed to collectively providing Ukraine with at least 40 billion euros worth of security assistance over the next year, including tanks, armored fighting vehicles, artillery, missiles, and a range of other capabilities that Ukraine needs to be able to affect effectively fight and win, Sullivan said.\nThe U.S., in partnership with allies, will provide Ukraine with air defense missiles and systems that are especially relevant to help protect Ukrainian forces on the front lines, civilians and the energy grid, he said.\nAlso, the United States, Denmark and the Netherlands have begun the transfer of F-16 fighter jets to Ukrainian forces, which will be operating in Ukraine this summer, according to a White House statement yesterday.\nNational Security Advisor Jake Sullivan National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan speaks at the NATO summit in Washington, July 11, 2024.

President Putin is determined to keep trying to take over Ukraine, and countries like Iran, North Korea and China are cheerleading him. We're clear eyed about all of that, but we are also clear eyed about Ukraine's strengths and resilience,\" he said.\nSpotlight: Support for Ukraine",
