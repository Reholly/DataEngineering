    "text": "Thailand’s 30 Baht Treatment Anywhere policy has received widespread approval from the public, providing accessible health services for minor illnesses through community pharmacies in 45 provinces.The 30 Baht Treatment Anywhere policy , which allows citizens to receive healthcare services for minor ailments at designated quality pharmacies, has been warmly received by the public. This initiative, part of the National Health Security Office (NHSO) and the Pharmacy Council’s ongoing efforts, aims to extend healthcare access to individuals under the national health insurance scheme, commonly known as the 30 Baht Gold Card.Deputy spokesperson for the Prime Minister ’s Office Karom Pholpruek revealed the policy’s success today. The initiative, which covers 16 common illnesses, has notably improved healthcare access for minor ailments in 45 provinces.Data from the Advanced Medical Electronic Data (AMED) system, managed by the National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA), indicated significant usage of the service. As of July 8, 2,151 community pharmacies are participating in the programme, providing services to 1,125,253 individuals.These individuals have accessed services a total of 2,849,528 times. The largest user group, people aged 45 to 64, accounted for 429,907 service visits.The most frequent reasons for seeking care included fever, cough, and sore throat, representing 47% of all service visits, equating to 1,191,643 cases. Other common ailments included joint pain and muscle soreness with 597,737 visits, skin conditions with 339,846 visits, abdominal pain with 239,967 visits, eye-related issues with 145,591 visits, headaches with 117,091 visits, and wounds with 114,809 visits, said Karom.“The data clearly shows that the 30 Baht Treatment Anywhere policy significantly aids individuals with minor illnesses. By using the 30 Baht Gold Card, patients can receive care without incurring additional costs. The community pharmacies play a crucial role in this policy, ensuring quality and standardised care provided by professional pharmacists, who offer consultations and medication guidance.”To utilise these services without any charges, citizens can either call the NHSO hotline at 1330 for assistance in locating a nearby participating pharmacy or check the list of participating pharmacies on the NHSO website . Additionally, pharmacies part of this initiative display a sticker reading My Quality Pharmacy – Providing Minor Illness Care at their premises, reported KhaoSod.“We encourage the public to look for the My Quality Pharmacy sticker and take advantage of the services provided. This initiative is a testament to our commitment to improving healthcare accessibility and quality for everyone.”",
