At the same time, he recalled that the Carter Center, the African Union, more than 65 electoral directors from around the world and invited governments will also do the same on July 28.\n“We are happy to open ourselves to the world so that they can see what will happen in Venezuela,” said Gil, highlighting that Venezuela has one of the best electoral systems in the world.\nIn this regard, he emphasized the security and transparency of the vote of Venezuelans, since it has “an automated system, both the vote and the counting are done digitally, without the subjectivity of the manipulation of minutes, it is an auditable system in all its phases, the entire process is absolutely transparent, in addition there is an electronic count done by the machine and manually by the table members,” he explained.\nOn the other hand, he stressed that the electoral campaign of the 10 candidates has been carried out peacefully and with complete normality: “The candidates have already made their proposals, some have submitted them to the National Electoral Council, as is appropriate, while others have made it known through the media,” he added.\nOn Wednesday, the National Electoral Council (CNE) began the process of auditing the software for totalization and production of voting machines, thus complying with what was established in the electoral schedule, in view of the presidential elections on July 28.\nAccording to information published in the media, the software audit began at 9:00 a.m. in Plaza Caracas, with the main purpose of checking the totalization system and its components.\nThe production of the machines began at 11:00 a.m. in Mariche. During this process, representatives of political organizations and technicians from the electoral body verify that the machines are produced with the certification codes.\n#international #observers #confirmed #support #Venezuela #June #elections\n2024-07-12 04:48:53",
