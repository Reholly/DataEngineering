    "text": "Port Macquarie Hastings Council has welcomed the NSW Government's $20 million commitment to the Pacific Highway â€“ Oxley Highway Interchange upgrade, with CEO Dr Clare Allen signalling it as a step in the right direction in addressing significant transport-related issues. Transport for NSW (TfNSW) confirmed on Wednesday that it would commence upgrades to increase traffic capacity and limit queuing on the northbound Pacific Highway off-ramp at 'the donut.' Initial work will see the north bound lanes duplicated from the existing 60km/h sign to the roundabout, while future works will see the westbound lanes between the off-ramp interchange and Billabong Drive also duplicated. The welcome news comes following calls by Council to [address congestion along the Oxley Highway](https://www.pmhc.nsw.gov.au/Your-Council/News-Notices/News-articles/2023/November/Council-calls-for-critical-road-funding-to-be-reinstated), most notably at the Wrights Road roundabout. \"Wednesday's announcement is a great outcome for our community, and we are pleased to see that the NSW Government has committed to improving safety for motorists at this location,\" Dr Allen said. \"There is, however, much more to do - and Council remains committed to working with all levels of government to address the urgent need for funding to be reinstated to progress Stage 2 of the Oxley Highway upgrades. \"The Oxley Highway at Wrights Road and Lake Road is one of the highest priority road issues within our region, as outlined in our [Integrated Transport Plan (ITP)](https://www.pmhc.nsw.gov.au/Your-Council/News-Notices/News-articles/2024/June/Council-motoring-ahead-with-Integrated-Transport-Planning) which is currently out on [public exhibition](https://haveyoursay.pmhc.nsw.gov.au/integrated-transport-plan). \"In partnership with the NSW Government, the ITP will seek to address transport network capacity requirements, anticipated changes in land use, population, and travel demand.\" Dr Allen said Council will continue to advocate strongly on behalf of the community to enable work to progress on Stage 2 of the Oxley Highway upgrades.
