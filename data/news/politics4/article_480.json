    "text": "The Philippines, together with the international community, reaffirmed its commitment in protecting and promoting “people’s interest and the full and responsible enjoyment of legally settled maritime entitlements and its accompanying rights and jurisdictions.”\nAs the 2016 arbitral award on the South China Sea (SCS) marked its 8th year, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said the Philippines remains unwavering in its commitment to peace “even in the face of the unlawful actions which have caused serious incidents in the South China Sea.”\n“The Philippines has continued to demonstrate this commitment. Without ever diminishing our resolve to protect and promote our people’s interest and the full and responsible enjoyment of our legally settled maritime entitlements and its accompanying rights and jurisdictions,” the DFA stated.\nEchoing the same sentiment, Philippine Ambassador to the United States Jose Manuel Romualdez emphasized “the Philippines has long been a staunch advocate of the rule of law.”\n“This is exemplified by Manila’s move to institute arbitral proceedings against China at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in 2013. On July 12, 2016, the Philippines became a prime example of how international law can be leveraged against neighbors with hegemonic ambitions,” he noted.\nRomualdez asserted that although the Philippines has come a long way with the 2016 arbitral award, there are still a lot of things to be done and vowed to “continue to utilize diplomatic channels and employ a multilateral approach in asserting [its] rights and reinforcing a stronger defense posture.”\n“Our efforts in the government, such as firm pronouncement and reinforcements of security capabilities combined with those of civil society organizations, such as civilian-led missions to the West Philippine Sea, are key steps towards realizing our national interest,” he said.\n“We have ramped up our efforts through strengthened partnerships, including our alliance with the United States,” Romualdez added.\nMoving forward, the DFA declared it will continue to “chart a course anchored on peace, security and prosperity in our region,” highlighting the importance of partnership and diplomacy with key countries.\n“We are encouraged by the expressions of support made by other States that confirm the final and binding status of the Award, including the G7’s consistent reaffirmation that it is a significant milestone and a useful basis for the peaceful management and resolution of differences at sea,” the DFA said in a statement.\n“The Award is a reaffirmation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and protects our rights as a coastal state and a seafaring people. Every effort to secure our legitimate interests in our maritime domain is a testament to the determination and courage of the Filipino people, while showcasing the Philippines’ vision of peace and stability that inspires and resonates beyond the waters of the South China Sea,” it added.",
