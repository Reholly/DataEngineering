And today brotherly relations between Pakistan and Azerbaijan are based on this foundation. We are brothers, we are friends. We support each other on every issue on every international case, in every international institution. When it comes to the case, which we introduce, our brothers support us and the same vice versa.\nOur straightforward support on the issue of Jammu and Kashmir is our commitment to our brotherhood and also our respect to international law. The rights of Kashmiris are ignored and violated for decades. United Nations Security Council resolutions clearly indicate how this issue must be resolved. But unfortunately, United Nations Security Council resolutions have no mechanism of implementation. But we, as brothers and friends, will always stand side by side with you, with our brothers in Kashmir, with international law, with justice. And I'm sure justice will prevail,\" the head of state noted.\nAzerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev informed his Russian counterpart about normalization process with Armenia Azerbaijani President: We commend US’ commitment to supporting lasting peace in the region SOFAZ's revenues in 2023 amounted to AZN 21,661,900.4, expenditures to AZN 11,832,650.1 İDMAN XƏBƏR 0 0 Follow us on Telegram t.me/apanewsaz Follow us on Instagram Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Follow us on Telegram t.me/apanewsaz Follow us on Instagram Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Official news President Ilham Aliyev and Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif made press statements- UPDATED 01:15 12 July 2024 President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev held expanded meeting with Prime Minister of Pakistan Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif in Islamabad- UPDATED-1 23:40 11 July 2024 Official dinner was hosted on behalf of Prime Minister of Pakistan Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif in honor of President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev 21:35 11 July 2024 Ceremony to exchange documents signed between Azerbaijan and Pakistan was held Islamabad- UPDATED 21:17 11 July 2024 NEWS FEED Pakistani PM: “Azerbaijan's victory is example of how justice and fair play come out in resounding fashion”\n02:22 12 July 2024 Record 8.6 million tickets sold for Paris Olympics\n02:10 12 July 2024 President Ilham Aliyev: Azerbaijan and Pakistan support each other on every international case\n01:58 12 July 2024 President Ilham Aliyev and Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif made press statements- UPDATED\n01:15 12 July 2024 Ukraine gets new $225 million US military aid after Biden meets Zelenskyy\n00:37 12 July 2024 Four years pass since Tovuz battles\n00:00 12 July 2024 UN projects world's population to peak within this century\n23:41 11 July 2024 President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev held expanded meeting with Prime Minister of Pakistan Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif in Islamabad- UPDATED-1\n23:40 11 July 2024 Ukraine's ex army chief Zaluzhnyi starts as ambassador to UK\n22:32 11 July 2024 Türkiye working to revitalize Ukraine grain deal: Erdoğan to Zelenskyy\n21:55 11 July 2024 Biden tells Zelenskyy US will announce new weapons for Ukraine\n21:42 11 July 2024 Official dinner was hosted on behalf of Prime Minister of Pakistan Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif in honor of President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev\n21:35 11 July 2024 Ceremony to exchange documents signed between Azerbaijan and Pakistan was held Islamabad- UPDATED\n21:17 11 July 2024 Speaker of Georgian Parliament: \"Campaign of hatred and terror are in many cases financed by Europe\"\n20:27 11 July 2024 U.S. MEGOBARI act passes Committee, poised for House vote\n20:04 11 July 2024 Baku to host Parliamentary meeting within framework of COP29\n20:00 11 July 2024 Four European nations agree to jointly develop long-range cruise missiles\n19:57 11 July 2024 \"Women Helpline Service” received 412 enquires in first half of year\n19:50 11 July 2024 At least 65 pilot whales die in Scottish mass stranding\n19:40 11 July 2024 Algeria's president Tebboune says he will run for second presidential term\n19:10 11 July 2024 President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev held meeting with Prime Minister of Pakistan Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif in limited format in Islamabad- UPDATED\n18:40 11 July 2024 False information that does not reflect any reality is being spread on behalf of President -
