China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), projects initiated by China to assist Pakistan for changing fate of the people of this region, he said while talking to a private television channel. Commenting on load-shedding, and slow economic progress, he said that last regime of Pakistan Tehreek e Insaf (PTI), had created hurdles in many development projects including CPEC. He further said the people were facing load-shedding and slow economic activity due to weak policies of PTIâ€™s last regime. The government under the leadership of Shehbaz Sharif is working day and night to restore economic activity and resolve energy issues, he said. He said, \"We are working to increase revenue, address line losses, and rectify issues in transmission lines so that we could provide maximum relief to poor people.\" The government is taking tough decision to achieve economic prosperity for the people, he added.",
