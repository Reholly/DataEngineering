    "text": "Mayara: Marrakech Forum offers an opportunity to serve security and stability across the globe Hespress EN Thursday 11 July 2024 - 18:48 The second edition of the Marrakech Parliamentary Economic Forum, to be held on July 11 and 12, 2024 under the High Patronage of King Mohammed VI, bringing together parliamentarians and economic players from the Euro-Mediterranean and Gulf regions, opened this Thursday in the Ochre city.\nThe event, organized by the Chamber of Councillors and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Mediterranean (APM), aims to strengthen economic and political cooperation between participating countries, with a particular focus on two key themes: the transition to green energy and support for entrepreneurship.\nWarnings from the President of the House of Councillors, Enaam Mayara\nThe opening of the Forum was marked by speeches from a number of eminent figures. These included the President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Mediterranean (APM) and the President of the Chamber of Councillors, Enaam Mayara, as well as Rachid Talbi El Alami, President of the Chamber of Representatives. Representatives of legislative institutions and parliamentary groups from Africa, the Arab world, Central, South and Latin America also took the floor.\nEnaam Mayara, President of the House of Councillors, opened the forum by warning of the international uncertainties exacerbated by crises such as the war in Gaza. He highlighted the devastating impact of this conflict on civilians and infrastructure, criticizing the fragility of the global food security system, the volatility of financial markets, and energy and inflationary crises. Enaam Mayara deplored the bleak picture of a world marked by economic and political uncertainty.\nMorocco’s role in regional cooperation\nThe forum also reaffirmed Morocco’s commitment to promoting regional cooperation and sustainable development, while highlighting the challenges and opportunities of economic integration in the Euro-Mediterranean and Gulf regions. Enaam Mayara highlighted Morocco’s efforts, under the leadership of King Mohammed VI, to invest in sustainable solutions and promote renewable energies. The country has established a legislative and institutional framework favorable to private investment in this sector, thus becoming a regional leader in energy transition.\nThe President of the House of Councillors spoke of the Sovereign’s Atlantic initiative, aimed at improving access to the Atlantic Ocean for Sahelian countries, and the Morocco-Nigeria gas pipeline project. These initiatives illustrate Morocco’s strategy to create spaces for development and regional cooperation, based on the win-win principle.\nThe forum also saw the launch of the Global South Parliamentary Observatory for Sustainable Development, in partnership with the Mediterranean Parliament. This observatory aims to strengthen South-South cooperation and propose concrete solutions to sustainable development challenges.\nEmphasis on women’s participation\nThe event also highlights the importance of women’s participation in decision-making processes, with the presentation of the activities of the Forum of Women Parliamentarians of the Mediterranean Parliament and the signing of cooperation agreements with women’s parliamentary networks in Africa and the Arab world. It also reaffirmed Morocco’s commitment to promoting regional cooperation and sustainable development, while highlighting the challenges and opportunities of economic integration in the Euro-Mediterranean and Gulf regions.\nThat said, the Forum, whose first session was held in December 2022 in Marrakech, offers an ideal platform for parliamentarians and APM’s founding partners. It provides a rich opportunity for interaction with political and economic players, from both the public and private sectors, as well as with academia and civil society.\nIntegration and Cooperation Forum\nThis forum aims to create an expanded South-South trade network and a self-sufficient green energy production and marketing zone. This initiative reflects APM’s commitment to forging political, economic and social cooperation between member states, in order to find common solutions to regional challenges.\nThe forum in this second session therefore focuses on two main themes: the transition to green energy, and support for entrepreneurship and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Discussions focus on mechanisms to ensure a sustainable and clean energy supply, while supporting SMEs in this transition. Participants also explore the challenges of innovation, sustainable development and artificial intelligence.\nDiscussions will focus on the production of and access to affordable, sustainable and clean energy. Participants will seek to identify regional solutions to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in this energy transition, promoting economic growth and technological innovation. The aim is to create an integrated economic and financial zone, capable of withstanding external factors and fostering enhanced cooperation between the regions concerned.\nMarrakech Forum Naama Mayara Follow the latest news from Hespress on WhatsApp Newsletter Subscribe now to the newsletter, to receive the latest news daily\nSubscribe Please verify email Pour terminer le processus d'abonnement ..
