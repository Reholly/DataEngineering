    "text": "Karl Rove endorsed North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum for former President Donald Trump‚Äôs running mate, making the remark on Thursday, days ahead of the Republican National Convention taking place in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\nTrump has yet to officially announce his choice for vice president and is expected to make that announcement any day now. However, there has been chatter with a few names continually surfacing, including Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance and Burgum. As for Karl Rove, he believes Burgum is the correct choice.\nOf the three names mentioned, ‚ÄúDoug Burgum is not only the safe pick, but also gives him some advantage in that he‚Äôs got a successful governor, who‚Äôs the governor of the second-largest energy producing state in the union,‚Äù Rove explained.\n‚ÄúIf you want to make energy an issue in the campaign, who better than that? But I‚Äôm with Josh. I think we‚Äôre ‚Äî we got to think about Donald Trump as not just simply the former president and potentially future president the United States, but the executive producer of The Apprentice ,‚Äù he said, explaining there ‚Äúmay be a couple of twists and turns before this thing is all done.‚Äù\nHis remarks come as all eyes largely move to Sen. Vance, particularly following the news that Donald Trump Jr. is slated to speak right before Trump‚Äôs running mate at the convention on Wednesday. It is widely known that Don Jr. is friends with Vance and has openly stated that the senator is his top choice for his father‚Äôs running mate.\n‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre talking the VP stakes, what are you guys thinking right now?‚Äù Don Jr. asked during a recent episode of his podcast, Triggered . ‚ÄúYou know, everyone knows, I‚Äôve sort of been for J.D. Vance.‚Äù\nHe also shared a clip of Vance speaking recently, encouraging people to watch it.\n‚ÄúStop what you‚Äôre doing and watch this right now if you want to know what America First is all about,‚Äù he remarked:\nStop what you're doing and watch this right now if you want to know what America First is all aboutüî•\n‚ÄúAmerica is not just an idea. America is a nation. America is a group of people with a common history and a common future.‚Äù ‚Äì @JDVance1 pic.twitter.com/1zQEv9u1Mm\n‚Äî Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) July 11, 2024\nNotably, last month, Burgum made it clear that he believes Trump can win ‚Äúregardless of who is vice president.‚Äù\n‚ÄúI think if we actually look in political history, the last time a vice-president pick actually helped swing an election was when Kennedy picked Lyndon Johnson and Lyndon Johnson help Kennedy win that race,‚Äù he said.\n‚ÄúAnd with President Trump, right now, where he is with Hispanics, with blacks, with people under age 30 and with independents. I mean, he‚Äôs very strong across the board. So he can pick someone that you can focus on like, ‚ÄòHey, let‚Äôs, let‚Äôs get someone gets stuff done.‚Äô Let‚Äôs get someone who helps him govern,‚Äù he added.\n2024 Election Politics Donald Trump Donald Trump Jr. Doug Burgum J.D.
