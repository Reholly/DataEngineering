[Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Updated: 12-07-2024 12:03 IST | Created: 12-07-2024 12:03 IST - Country: - United Kingdom Former Pakistan all-rounder Shahid Afridi believes fans will get great entertainment if arch-rivals Pakistan and India face each other in the final of the World Legends Championship. The ongoing tournament is nearing its climax, with four teams competing for a spot in the final. In the upcoming semi-finals, West Indies Champions will take on Pakistan Champions on Friday, while India Champions will face off against Australia Champions in the second contest. There is a strong possibility of another high-stakes clash between India and Pakistan if they both win their respective matches. Afridi emphasized the players' determination to reach the final, noting that a Pakistan-India face-off would thrill fans. \"All the teams' players are determined to win the semi-final and make it to the final [...] fans will get great entertainment if Pakistan vs India takes place,\" Afridi stated, according to Geo News. In their group stage encounter, Pakistan dominated India with a commanding 68-run victory. Pakistan's batters have shown impressive form throughout the tournament, with Sharjeel Khan and Shoaib Malik among the top five scorers, and Sohaib Maqsood also in the top ten scorers list. Pakistan lost only one of their five group stage matches, winning against Australia, India, the West Indies, and England, with their sole defeat coming against South Africa. The Pakistan Champions team includes notable players like Younis Khan, Misbah-ul-Haq, Kamran Akmal, Abdul Razzaq, Wahab Riaz, and Mohammad Hafeez, among others.
