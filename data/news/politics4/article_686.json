    "text": "Maputo, Mozambique â€” Botswana's President Mokgweetsi Masisi has promised to continue supporting Mozambique in its fight against violent extremism in the oil-and-gas rich province of Cabo Delgado, even after the imminent departure of southern African troops from the troubled region.\nAddressing a media conference upon his arrival in the Mozambican capital Maputo late Wednesday, Masisi said the withdrawal of troops from Cabo Delgado does not mark the end of his country's support in combating violent extremism.\nMasisi said Botswana remains ready to assist Mozambique.\n\"In the military and security space, we are going to share our know-how and expertise because we are to you what you are to us,\" said Masisi. \"And just to make it clear, we will stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of Mozambique in the quest for peace, so any instability such as we witnessed, we will be ready to intervene.\"\nBotswana is the second country, following Tanzania to pledge continued support for Mozambique after the departure of troops from SADC, the Southern African Development Community.\nThe SADC troops are due to leave Mozambique on July 15 due to financial issues.\nAfter holding official talks with Masisi at his seaside palace in Maputo late Wednesday, Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi thanked his visitor for Botswana's role in the fight against terrorism in Cabo Delgado.\n\"Together, we work to combat these attacks and this help does not end,\" said Nyusi. \"There are many ways Masisi is supporting Mozambique and that will continue. We are training our officers, our military personnel in Botswana. And the flow will continue because these are the ones who must ensure the continuation of the fight.\"\nClose Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox\nTop Headlines Botswana Arms and Armies Mozambique Submit By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy .\nSuccess!

If you look at al-Shabab in East Africa, it has been there for more than 10 years,\" said Zambara. \"So, anyone who thought that rising extremism in northern Mozambique is going to be a short war would not have looked at how terrorists have operated, not only in Africa, but even globally. \"\nThe insurgency in northern Mozambique began in 2017 and already has caused close to 6,000 deaths, leading to the displacement of more than 1 million people. Multinational oil and gas firms operating in the region, such as Exxon Mobil and Total, were forced to suspend operations over security concerns.\nRead the original article on VOA .",
