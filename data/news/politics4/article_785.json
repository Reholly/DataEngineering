    "text": "New Delhi: The Supreme Court has granted interim bail to the Chief Minister in the now scraped policy case registered by the Enforcement Directorate today. The CM will, however, continue to remain in jail, as he was arrested by CBI in the same case.Advocate Vivek Jain, counsel for Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, celebrated the occasion and posted on social media platform X. He said, There are many issues of law with which the Supreme Court was grappling. One of the issues was the necessity. Further, the Delhi State President and Aam Aadmi Legal Cell Advisor Advocate Sanjeev Nasair also took to X and posted, I thank the Supreme Court that today is a day of great relief. We have been saying from the very first day. AAP National General Secretary Organisation and MP Sandeep Pathak said, This is a relief... When they can't stop this party, they jail all the leaders of the party. So, in such a situation, the Supreme Court order is very soothing. I believe that party is not important, the country is. It is very important in the national interest, that a dictator doesn't attempt to finish off a party like this. So, such decisions should be written in golden letters in the history of the country... Delhi minister Saurabh Bharadwaj said that the government had anticipated the SC would give bail to Kejriwal which is why the CBI arrested him in the same case PMLA is a black law. The provisions for bail under this are so difficult that it is almost impossible to get bail... First, the lower court granted him bail and observed that ED is acting with bias ... So, today's bail by the Supreme Court is a huge thing. Centre had anticipated that the Supreme Court would grant him bail in the ED matter. So, to ensure that he continues to be in jail even after bail, the CBI arrested him... The burden of proof lies on the CBI. So, I don't think there will be much issue. It's just a matter of time before Arvind Kejriwal comes out of jail, Saurabh Bharadwaj said. However, the BJP hit out at the AAP and said that the interim bail was not a complete relief from the crime committed.BHP Chief Virendraa Sachdeva said in a post on X This is a decision between the investigation agency and judiciary. Interim Bail doesn't mean that you are acquitted. Let the final decision come. Additionally, BJP MP Kamaljeet Sehrawat said The interim bail is not a relief from the crime that one has committed. The Interim bail only provides for one to stay out of jail as the case proceeds. It does not mean that Kejriwal has not done a scam, or that he was not involved in corruption. Perhaps, the Supreme Court has allowed him to be out and work as the people of Delhi are suffering. But the court has not acquitted him. A bench headed by Justice Sanjiv Khanna referred Kejriwal's petition challenging his arrest by the ED to a larger bench.The Supreme Court while granting interim bail to Kejriwal in the ED case, observed that the Delhi CM has suffered incarceration of 90 days and that it's conscious that he is an elected leader.The top court had reserved the verdict on Kejriwal's plea for May 17.",
