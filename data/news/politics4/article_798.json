(HT/File ) (HT_PRINT) The Aam Aadmi Party praised the Supreme Court on Friday for granting interim bail to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in the excise policy scam case filed by the Enforcement Directorate, asserting that this move has uncovered a BJP “conspiracy” against him.\nDespite being granted interim bail by the Supreme Court in the excise policy scam case filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), Arvind Kejriwal, the national convenor of the AAP, will remain in jail due to his subsequent arrest by the CBI in connection with a corruption case linked to the alleged scam. CBI arrested Kejriwal, who was under the ED's custody.\nIn a joint press conference, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders Atishi, Saurabh Bharadwaj, and Sandeep Pathak hailed the Supreme Court verdict as a “victory of truth.”\n#WATCH | On Supreme Court granting interim bail to Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal in ED matter of Excise Policy case, Delhi Minister Atishi says, \"...BJP knew that he (Arvind Kejriwal) has been granted bail by the Rouse Avenue Court, they know that he will get bail by the Supreme Court… pic.twitter.com/vVnh6C6Ziw\n— ANI (@ANI) July 12, 2024 Pathak said the Supreme Court's verdict is “definitely a relief”.\n\"When they can't stop this party, they jail all the leaders of the party. So, in such a situation, the Supreme Court order is very soothing. I believe that the party is not important; the country is. It is very important in the national interest that a dictator doesn't attempt to finish off a party like this. So, such decisions should be written in golden letters in the country's history,\" Pathak said.\n#WATCH | On Supreme Court granting interim bail to Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal in ED matter of Excise Policy case, AAP National General Secretary Organisation and MP Sandeep Pathak says, \"This is definitely a relief...

Today, the apex court said that this matter be referred to a larger bench so that it can't be found out if his arrest is right or wrong. I think the Supreme Court has given a huge jolt to the BJP. I thank the Court... I think Arvind Kejriwal will get bail in CBI, too, and he will be out of jail soon.”\n#WATCH | On Supreme Court granting interim bail to Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal in ED matter of Excise Policy case, Punjab minister Harpal Singh Cheema says, \"BJP has made a false case of excise policy scam by conspiring against several AAP leaders.

He told ANI that the law's bail provisions are so difficult that it is almost impossible to get bail.\n\"First, the lower court granted him bail and observed that ‘ED is acting with bias’. So, today's bail by the Supreme Court is a huge thing. Centre had anticipated that the Supreme Court would grant him bail in the ED matter. So, to ensure that he continues to be in jail even after bail, the CBI arrested him... The burden of proof lies on the CBI. So, I don't think there will be much issue. It's just a matter of time, Arvind Kejriwal will come out of jail,” he added.\nHow BJP reacted… Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Vijay Kumar Sinha welcomed the court's decision and said, \"Both bail and punishment are given by the court. The NDA alliance has no role in this, but these people play the game of deceiving the public.”\n#WATCH | On Supreme Court granting interim bail to CM Arvind Kejriwal in ED matter of Excise Policy case, Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Vijay Kumar Sinha says, \"This is the decision of the court, we welcome the decision of the court...

But it doesn't mean that Arvind Kejriwal has not done a scam or that he was not involved in corruption. Perhaps the Supreme Court has allowed him to be out and work as the people of Delhi suffer. But the court has not acquitted him,” she added.\n#WATCH | On Supreme Court granting interim bail to Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal in ED matter of Excise Policy case, BJP MP Kamaljeet Sehrawat says, \"Interim Bail is not a relief from the crime that one has committed.
