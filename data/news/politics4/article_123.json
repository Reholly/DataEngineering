    "text": "The governor of Cross River State, Bassey Otu, has said that every Nigerian should be happy with the judgement of the Supreme Court granting fiscal autonomy to local government councils.\nHe spoke to correspondents after a meeting with President Bola Tinubu at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, on Thursday.\nOtu advised that the Apex Court’s ruling should be taken in good faith against the backdrop of President Bola Tinubu’s Renewed Hope Agenda, which he observed is democratic.\nHe expressed confidence that the ruling would not be opposed as it is in the interest of development.\nGovernor Otu stated: “About the Supreme Court judgement,. Nigeria is a democratic country, and we know very well that President Tinubu and the Renewed Hope agenda are democratic.\n“And I believe that the judgement is taken in very good faith. All Nigerians should be happy about it.\n“I don’t think anybody is against development in the local governments. I don’t think so.\n“I have not read the details of the judgement as passed; when we do, I believe that the application of it should add some pep to our local government administration.”\nALSO READ THESE TOP STORIES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE\nReps query Women Minister spending practices FULL LIST: 12 more state-owned tertiary institutions submit data to NELFUND BREAKING: Tinubu swears in eight new permanent secretaries UPDATED: Oyo APC lawmaker, Akinremi, is dead Reps to scrutinize controversial clauses in Samoa partnership agreement FULL LIST: NGX suspends eight companies from trading in shares",
