    "text": "Other than the “Vice President Trump” gaffe and maybe a few other minor stumbles, I actually thought Biden did a nice job at the NATO press conference. Up until then I was probably leaning towards the make Harris the nominee camp. But on foreign policy Biden really showed he knows his stuff, and even on domestic questions he did pretty good. So now count me in the “let’s keep Biden a little longer” camp to see if he can turn things around. To help I’d like to offer Joe a suggestion: do a weekly town hall with American voters, both democrats, republicans and independents. Make these weekly and if a cable channel won’t cover it, put it on YouTube. That’s where most people watch videos now anyhow. Do it every Saturday afternoon or night. Remember those Saturday morning radio messages presidents used to do? Bring that back but make it a Town Hall format. Heck, even ask George Clooney, Rob Riner or Jon Stewart to moderate it. Let people see the real Joe that apparently people around him see. Town Halls like this are something that Trump would never do. If Joe does them every week I think it would really move the needle on his favorability rating. He should have been doing these all along during his term. And one more tip Joe: If anyone asks you about a gaffe or flub you made or make, just say “You know, I admit I make a gaffe every now and then. I guess I’m the gaffe candidate. But Trump is both the gaffe AND the liar candidate so who would you really want as your president?”",
