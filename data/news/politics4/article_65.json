    "text": "Biden Announces New $1.7 Billion Grants For EV Production [Share] The Biden administration is throwing nearly $2 billion at electric vehicle manufacturing and assembly sites across eight states, including the political battlegrounds of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Georgia. The Energy Department will dish out $1.7 billion in grants, aiming to create or retain thousands of union jobs and breathe life back into communities dependent on auto manufacturing. Beyond the trio of battleground states, the cash will flow to EV facilities in Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, and Virginia. This is a broad sweep of the automotive supply chain, covering everything from parts for electric motorcycles and school buses to hybrid powertrains and heavy-duty truck batteries. It's a move that screams both economic rejuvenation and environmental crusade, wrapped in the kind of high-stakes political drama that's become all too familiar in recent years. The timing of this announcement isn't lost on anyone. Biden, at 81, is shaking off calls to step aside after a less-than-stellar debate performance, clinging to his agenda while critics circle. Former President Donald Trump, despite his felony conviction, still has a chokehold on the Republican Party. The political theater is as intense as ever. This influx of federal cash is just a piece of the puzzle. It complements $177 billion in private sector investment in EV and battery manufacturing since Biden took office. Officials stress that the grants come with strings attached: commitments to workers and communities must be met, and environmental reviews will be completed before any money changes hands. If everything goes according to plan, the projects funded by these grants will create over 2,900 jobs and secure about 15,000 union jobs across 11 facilities. Stellantis is set to receive almost $335 million to revamp an idled Illinois plant for EV assembly and another $250 million to convert an Indiana transmission plant to make electric drive modules. General Motors will grab $500 million to transform its Lansing, Michigan plant into an EV manufacturing facility. Ford will not receive any funds.
