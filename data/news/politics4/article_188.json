    "text": "WASHINGTON (NEXSTAR) -- During the final day of the 75th anniversary of the NATO summit in Washington, D.C., President Joe Biden announced a new $225 million aid package for Ukraine, including an additional Patriot missile system to bolster its air defenses against a deadly onslaught of Russian airstrikes.\nPresident Biden attended back-to-back meetings with foreign allies, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on the final day of the NATO summit in the nation's capital.\n\"You made it clear Russia will not prevail,\" Biden said.\nZelenskyy thanked the U.S. for its continued support including April's $95 billion weapons package.\n\"And we're working with our NATO allies to ensure Ukraine is flying F-16s this summer, show the world that we stand with Ukraine now and in the future,\" Biden said.\n\"Together we are preserving Ukraine's independence and freedom,\" Zelenskyy said.\nWednesday night, President Biden hosted NATO leaders including Zelenskyy at the White House.\nOn Capitol Hill, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell slammed President Biden for being slow to send aid to Ukraine.\n\"This week would have been a great opportunity for the commander-in-chief to start backing up his words with firm commitments to start investing seriously, seriously in hard power,\" McConnell said.\nLooming large over the summit were President Biden's own political woes, but several world leaders expressed their confidence in the president.",
