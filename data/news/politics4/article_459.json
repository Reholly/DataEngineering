    "text": "Vietnam is now in its fifth year of implementing the National Digital Transformation Program. Over the past four years, the first year marked the initiation of digital transformation, the second year served as a comprehensive rehearsal during the Covid-19 pandemic, the third year focused on building national digital platforms, and the fourth year centered on the development of digital data.\nTo provide readers with insights into Vietnam's digital transformation journey, VietNamNet conducted an interview with Dr. Guy Diedrich, Senior Vice President and Global Innovation Officer at Cisco, and Mr. Jason Kalai, Acting General Manager of Cisco Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.\nDr. Guy Diedrich, Senior Vice President and Global Innovation Officer at Cisco (left), and Mr. Jason Kalai, Acting General Director of Cisco Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. Photo: The Vinh. What has Vietnam achieved after more than four years of implementing the national digital transformation program?\nMr. Jason Kalai: Vietnam has made remarkable strides in all three pillars of digital transformation - digital government, digital economy, and digital society. This progress is a clear testament to the success of the country's digital transformation plans.\nThere has been significant change in adopting digital technology to drive economic growth, leverage digital data, and enhance smart connectivity. In recent years, we have also witnessed the increasing role of technology in the daily lives of Vietnamese people.\nSome opinions suggest that raising awareness about digital transformation is one of the things that Vietnam has done well. Could you please share your views on this?\nDr. Guy Diedrich: Vietnam stands out as one of the countries with a strong awareness of digital transformation in everyday life, from government officials to the general public. This is a significant advantage on the journey toward national digital transformation.\nThe government has prioritized digital transformation with various decisions and policies, such as the \"National Digital Transformation Program to 2025, with a vision to 2030,\" issued in 2020, and the \"ICT infrastructure planning for 2021-2030, with a vision to 2050,\" signed in early 2024.\nVietnamese businesses also have forward-thinking leaders ready to act on digital transformation, supported by a young workforce that quickly adapts to technology and innovation.\nBesides the initial results, what challenges does Vietnam face in realizing its vision to become a digital nation?\nCisco experts recommend that Vietnam needs individuals who clearly understand how to use technology, maintain it, manage it, and benefit from it. Illustration by Q.Bao Dr. Guy Diedrich: Vietnam faces challenges similar to those of other countries globally, primarily the skills gap. There are many jobs requiring advanced skills, and Vietnam needs to rapidly upskill its workforce to meet these demands.\nMy advice to world leaders we work with in 50 countries is not to invest solely in technology. If Vietnam invests only in technology without concurrently investing in workforce skill development, many opportunities will be missed.\nVietnam needs individuals who understand how to use, maintain, manage, and benefit from technology. Without the necessary skills, this cannot be achieved. Enhancing skills will also create numerous job opportunities for future generations, contributing significantly to GDP growth.\nI emphasize that bridging the skills gap is a fundamental task for any country aiming to achieve digital transformation.\nCisco recently announced the Country Digital Acceleration (CDA) program in Vietnam. What specific initiatives will be focused on in the near future?\nDr. Guy Diedrich: Implementing the Country Digital Acceleration (CDA) program in Vietnam demonstrates our vision and commitment to supporting Vietnamese agencies, organizations, and businesses in their digital transformation journey. Aligned with the \"National Digital Transformation Program to 2025 and Vision to 2030,\" CDA in Vietnam focuses on enhancing the country's technological capabilities through key initiatives centered on three main pillars: national infrastructure transformation, enterprise transformation, and public sector transformation.\nFor national infrastructure transformation, we will collaborate with local service providers to develop 5G, equipping these companies with necessary skills and best practices for network innovation. 5G infrastructure is crucial for Vietnam's digital transformation, enhancing data transmission, boosting business productivity, and improving community connectivity.\nIn enterprise transformation, we will provide cutting-edge technology to the financial services and manufacturing sectors, investing in the co-development of advanced digital solutions to drive industry-wide digital transformation. This will increase the competitiveness of Vietnam's financial services and manufacturing sectors, promoting economic growth.\nFor public sector transformation, we will work with public entities to enhance Vietnam's national digital infrastructure. Initiatives in this pillar will support the establishment of a digital government, improve urban management, and promote comprehensive community development.\nMr. Jason Kalai: Vietnam's digital economy has developed positively in recent years, with digital interactions and cloud-first models quickly becoming the norm for businesses nationwide. Coupled with the government's national digital transformation plan, now is the ideal time for public-private partnerships to vigorously promote the country's digital transformation agenda.\nIn the coming period, we will work with stakeholders such as the government, industry leaders, and academic institutions to co-develop and co-innovate advanced solutions and beneficial services across the three mentioned pillars.\nVan Anh",
