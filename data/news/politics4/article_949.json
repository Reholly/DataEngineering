    "text": "Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Singh Mann on July 9 handed over a cheque of financial assistance worth Rs 1 crore to the kin of farmer Shubhkaran Singh, who was killed in the clashes between security personnel and farmers in February this year. He also handed over an appointment letter of government job to the deceased farmer&#039;s family. Shubhkaran Singh, a native of Bathinda, died during the clashes at Khanauri border on February 21, amid farmers&#039; &#039;Dilli challo&#039; protests against the Centre. The clashes started when some of the protesting farmers tried to march towards the barricades and were stopped by the security personnel deployed there. After handing over the cheque and the appointment letter, Mann interacted with the bereaved family members. The Punjab CM said that the state government is committed to the well-being of the state&#039;s food growers and will ensure their welfare, an official release stated. He also said that the young farmer, Shubkaran Singh, had &quot;attained martyrdom during firing at the border&quot;. Calling it a barbaric and tragic incident that bruised the psyche of every Punjabi, Bhagwant Mann further said &quot;the martyrdom of a farmer is a huge and irreparable loss for the family which cannot be compensated by any means.&quot; He said that the Rs 1 crore financial assistance and government job was a humble initiative of the state government to bail out the family in crisis. &#039;State Govt&#039;s Gesture To Recognise Singh&#039;s Supreme Sacrifice&#039;: Punjab CM &quot;This is a humble gesture of the state government in recognition of the supreme sacrifice made by the young farmer for the cause of food growers of the country,&quot; he added. The Punjab CM further said that the resilient and hard working farmers of the state have played a role in making India self-reliant in food production, as a result of which all the countrymen are indebted to them. He mourned that despite the limited natural resources, Punjab&#039;s farmers have toiled to produce grains for the country at the cost of overexploitating the only available natural resources of the state, including water level and soil fertility. Mann stated that it is the duty of the government to assist the farmers and their families in the hour of crisis, adding that the Punjab government is already making strenuous efforts in this regard. Samyukta Kisan Morcha (Non-Political) leader Jagjit Singh Dallewal and other farmer leaders were also present on the occasion.",
