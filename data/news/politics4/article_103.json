    "text": "NCP(SP) leader Sharad Pawar addressing party workers during a function in Mumbai. With Maharashtra assembly elections likely to be held in just three months from now, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Sharad Pawar on Thursday sounded a poll bugle and said that MVA can win over 225 seats. The election to 288-seats Maharashtra assembly is likely to be held in the month of October. Stating that Maharashtra is in the hand of wrong people, Sharad Pawar said that the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), which comprises of Congress, NCP (SP) and Shiv Sena (UBT) can win 225 seats. Pawar made the remarks while the former MLA Sudhakarrao Bhalerao of Udgir and many colleagues joined the party in presence at him, NCP leaders Supriya Sule and Jayant Patil at Yashwantrao Centre in Mumbai. Bhalerao, a former MLA, who won from Udgir in Latur in 2009 and 2014 submitted his resignation to BJP and then joined the NCP (SP). &quot;When the assembly election of Maharashtra will take place in October, of the 288 seats, I see that we can win over 225 seats. There is an expectation that the regime will be changed, and for that we all should take efforts,&quot; said Pawar. Pawar further stated that five years ago, only six MPs from opposition parties from Maharashtra were elected to Lok Sabha. However, this time, even people felt that situation should change, and of the 48, the opposition MPs emerged winner in 31 seats. Of 10 seats we contested, we won eight seats,&quot; added Pawar. Pawar also told the NCP(SP) leaders and workers to resolve with collective strength to make Maharashtra the most powerful state in the country. Meanwhile, both Maha Vikas Aghadi and Mahayuti, comprising of BJP, NCP (Ajit Pawar) and Shiv Sena (Eknath Shinde) have said that they will contest the upcoming assembly polls in alliance. According to report, the state BJP-unit has told Central leadership that being the largest party in the state, they should contest 180 seats. The Ajit Pawar and Shinde camp leaders have also expressed that they should get 80 to 100 seats. Last week, Deputy CM and BJP leader Fadnavis said that they will have to walk together as the Opposition is ready to make compromises among themselves, and added that the alliance remains intact only when you compromise. Last month, Shiv Sena leader Ramdas Kadam urged Eknath Shinde to ask Narendra Modi and Amit Shah to give them 100 seats (for assembly) and they will ensure that 90 are elected.",
