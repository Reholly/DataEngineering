    "text": "BudgIT has said that Thursday’s Supreme Court judgment endorsing Local Government Autonomy is a fiscal governance and accountability win for Nigeria.\nIt disclosed this in a statement on Thursday by its Communications Officer, Nancy Odimegwu.\nDAILY POST reports that the Supreme Court on Thursday barred the 36 state governors from receiving funds for the 774 local government areas in Nigeria.\nThe judgment also stopped the governors from removing democratically elected Local government chairmen.\nReacting to the judgment, Gabriel Okeowo, BudgIT’s Country Director said that the development would bring transparency to local government allocations.\nIt called for restricted adherence and implementation by all stakeholders.\n“This ruling is a victory and a significant step towards enhancing fiscal transparency, accountability, and local governance in Nigeria.\n“In light of this, we call for strict adherence to this ruling and urge all stakeholders, including state governments, to respect the rule of law and uphold the principles of fiscal responsibility,” he said.",
