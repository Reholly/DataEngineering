    "text": "NATO Secretary General concludes landmark 75th Anniversary Washington Summit\nOn Thursday (11 July 2024), Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg wrapped up NATO’s 75th Anniversary Summit in Washington, D.C. At the Summit, Allies made decisions to further strengthen deterrence and defence, bolster long-term support to Ukraine and deepen global partnerships.<!IoRangePreExecute>\nIn the morning, Allied leaders met with leaders from Australia, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and the European Union to address shared security challenges and further deepen cooperation. Faced with the growing alignment of Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, NATO is working ever more closely with partners in the Indo-Pacific and with the European Union to help preserve peace and protect the rules-based international order. Mr. Stoltenberg also highlighted that China is a decisive enabler of Russia’s war against Ukraine. The Washington Summit declaration refers to the strategic partnership between Moscow and Beijing as a “cause for profound concern.”\nIn the afternoon, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy joined Allied leaders for a meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council at the level of Heads of State and Government. The Secretary General indicated that Allies continue to support Ukraine on its irreversible path to NATO membership.\nYesterday (10 July), Allies agreed to establish NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine, to coordinate the provision of military equipment and training for Ukraine. They also announced a pledge of long-term security assistance to Ukraine with a minimum baseline of 40 billion euros within the next year. “This pledge will ensure greater burden-sharing of military support,” said Mr Stoltenberg. “It will also provide Ukraine the reliable support it needs to deter and defend against future Russian aggression now and in the future.” The Secretary General welcomed that more Allies have signed bilateral security agreements with Ukraine, bringing the total to 20. He also highlighted that Allies have agreed to establish a NATO-Ukraine Joint Analysis, Training and Education Centre in Poland.\nThe 2025 NATO Summit will be held in The Hague, the Netherlands.",
