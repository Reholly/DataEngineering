In his word during a reception organized Thursday by the embassy on the 72nd anniversary of July 23 Revolution, the Egyptian ambassador said the relation between both countries witnessed further prosperity, especially in light of willingness of the Egyptian companies to enter Senegalese market in the fields of housing, renewable energy and food manufacturing. A number of agreements will be inked between both sides in the fields of fisheries, agriculture, training youth diplomats and information technology, Aref said. The embassy is working on boosting trade and investment ties via opening nontraditional markets for the Egyptian products including the seeds of wheat and rice, he added.
