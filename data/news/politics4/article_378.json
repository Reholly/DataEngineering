    "text": "Special Assistant to Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister on Population Welfare, Malik Liaqat Ali, has emphasized that ensuring access to family planning and reproductive health services was a top priority for the provincial government. This initiative aims at curbing the alarming increase in the province population. Addressing a one-day seminar organized by the Population Welfare Department on World Population Day, Malik Liaqat Ali highlighted the need for public awareness regarding population control. He called upon scholars and intellectuals to play an active role in educating the youth about family planning to prevent rapid population growth. The seminar was attended by Secretary Population, Mutasim Bilah, Director General Population, and other officials from the department, as well as people from various walks of life. In his address, Malik Liaqat Ali stated, “The main purpose of celebrating this day is to draw people’s attention to the problems arising due to population growth and lack of resources. The solution to the economic and social problems of the growing population is essential. All efforts for development and prosperity prove futile when every member of society lacks access to basic needs. For Pakistan to develop and stand among the developed countries, sustainable and effective family planning must become a part of the national security model.” He further added that controlling the population growth is crucial for maintaining a good and prosperous life. He pointed out that Bangladesh, which once had a higher population than Pakistan, has successfully controlled its population growth through effective strategies and the support of religious circles. Pakistan’s population will double in the coming years if not addressed, posing significant challenges for both families and the government. Overcrowded cities and poor maternal and child health are among the issues that will arise. “The relationship between population growth and socio-economic development is well established. Our neighboring and Muslim countries have progressed manifold by investing in family planning and reproductive health. Our progress does not match that of countries where these investments have been prioritized. We are lagging behind in many development indicators compared to our neighboring countries,” Malik Liaqat Ali noted. He reiterated the provincial government’s commitment to family planning and reproductive health, despite the challenges ahead. He stressed the importance of partnership and cooperation with the government, people, relevant departments, and non-governmental organizations to achieve sustainable population growth for the province development and prosperity. “We are here to serve, and we will work for the welfare of the people as much as we can,” he said. He assured that the government is committed to ensuring that people receive their rights, and that any kind of abuse or corruption will not be tolerated in government offices, following a zero-tolerance policy.
