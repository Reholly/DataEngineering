Address the ceremony, she announced the second phase of the e-bike project, plans to establish solarised charging stations in the colleges and universities and motorbikes for orphan students. A scholarship programme worth Rs25 billion was announced for the students along with early launching of a laptop scheme. The chief minister said Punjab would eventually adopt electric transport under a Green Vision Programme. She also urged other provinces to launch e-bike schemes for students. The CM said the number of e-bikes would be increased in the next phase. The Punjab government will pay half of the Rs40,000 down payment for each e-bike handed over under the scheme. The chief minister said more than 100,000 applications had been submitted and 27,200 students would be given motorbikes. All districts have equal share in the scheme. We received applications of 8,000 female students and we are giving e-bikes to all of them, she added. She said girl should learn to drive e-bike for their empowerment.
