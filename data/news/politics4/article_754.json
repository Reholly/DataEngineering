    "text": "Dignitaries including Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan at the venue of inauguration of trial run at Vizhinjam International Port | Photo: Screen Grab / Youtube @VizhinjamInternationalSeaport Thiruvananthapuram: The official welcome ceremony for San Fernando, the first cargo ship that arrived at Vizhinjam port , has begun. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan officially welcomed San Fernando to Vizhinjam port. Union Ports Minister Sarbananda Sonowal is the chief guest on the occasion. Kerala Assembly Speaker A N Shamseer, state Ports Minister V N Vasavan and his cabinet colleagues K N Balagopal, V Sivankutty, K Rajan and G R Anil, UDF MLA M Vincent and APSEZ Managing Director Karan Adani also participated in the function. Vizhinjam is one of the biggest ports in the world. India is placed on the world map through the port of Vizhinjam, said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan inaugurating the trial run of the first cargo ship that arrived in Vizhinjam international port here. The Chief Minister also said that a new chapter has started in the development of Kerala. He said it is a proud moment for the country itself. Although it is a trial run now, the operation of Vizhinjam port is starting with this. Full-scale operation will begin soon, he added. A full-haul trial run of the container ship began on Thursday. With this, the containers arriving at the mothership will be unloaded at the port yard, and then transshipment will begin after bringing the small ships back to the port. The containers brought from China will be taken to Mumbai and Kolkata on ships arriving at the port in the next few days. As part of the trial run, the cargo ships will arrive continuously till September. The commercial operations of the port will be inaugurated within three months. Meanwhile, a controversy was sparked as Leader of Opposition V D Satheesan was not invited to the ceremony. Shashi Tharoor MP will also abstain. Latin Archdiocese Archbishop Thomas J Neto's name is included in the notice, but the archbishop is of the position that he may not participate in the ceremony because he was not officially invited.
