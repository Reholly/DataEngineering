    "text": "PITTSFIELD, Mass. - Pittsfield is offering a course for people to learn about their local government.\nThe citizen’s academy is a 12-week course to teach people about how their local government operates. This program will allow people to hear from many city departments firsthand about what they do.\nSome areas include the Pittsfield Fire and Police departments, the Department of Public Service and Utilities, the City Council and School Committee, and an overview of municipal government.\n“They get to learn about all the aspects of the city, I think that there’s really no department left unturned within the city,\" Pittsfield Mayor Peter Marchetti said. \"Some get a deeper dive than others based on the amount of work that a department does.”\nThe sessions are once a week for two hours and the deadline for the applications is Friday, July 26. You must be 18 years or older and live or work in Pittsfield.\nYou can get more information on their website and the application can be found here . Paper copies can also be found at the mayor's office and turned in there.",
