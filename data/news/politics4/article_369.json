    "text": "West Vancouver NDP members have nominated longtime activist and nurse practitioner Sara Eftekhar to run for them in West Vancouver-Capilano.\nThe party confirmed Eftekhar, 34, as their candidate following a nomination meeting on July 7.\nEftekhar came to Canada with her family from Iran when she was eight and spent much of her young life as an advocate, including becoming Canada’s first ever youth delegate to the United Nations. She has been a volunteer for Hollyburn Family Services, where she used her Farsi language skills to help the non-profit reach women in the Persian community.\nProfessionally, she worked as a Lions Gate Hospital nurse before becoming a nurse practitioner, and has spent much of her spare time advocating free contraception. And as a member of the North Shore Co-ordinating Committee to End Violence Against Women, she helped launch the hospital’s new forensic nursing unit.\nEftekhar said she was inspired to enter the political arena so she could bring change on wider scale.\n“As an outsider of the political system, there’s a limit to how much that you can do. And from talking to previous MLAs… I’ve just learned that you can do so much more in terms of making systems change,” she said. “I’m looking forward to being able to bring that advocacy and activism background as well as my empathy and compassion and listening skills into politics.\"\nIn the months leading up to the Oct. 19 election, Eftekhar said you can expect to hear her campaigning on housing affordability, working with the North Shore municipalities on transportation solutions and, given her professional background, increasing access to primary care for seniors and families.\nPrior to their name change to BC United, the BC Liberals counted West Vancouver-Capilano as one of their safest seats, routinely winning the riding with more than 55 per cent of the popular vote. But voters there have only had two MLAs since 2001, and Eftekhar said the centre-right party takes the riding for granted.\n“The demographics are changing and I believe that it’s really time for a fresh voice and a fresh perspective,” she said.\nAlso nominated in West Vancouver-Capilano is Caroline Elliott, running for BC United. The BC Conservatives and Green Party have not yet named candidates.\n[email protected]\ntwitter.com/brentrichter\nReader Feedback",
