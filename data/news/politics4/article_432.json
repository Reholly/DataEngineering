    "text": "Rishi Sunak delivered a powerful maiden speech as the leader of the opposition in the House of Commons on July 9. Sunak began his speech by congratulating newly elected Prime Minister Keir Starmer for his victory. He further said 'sorry' and apologised to his party members who were not re-elected. Sunak promised that his party would undertake their new role as the official opposition with professionalism, effectiveness, and humility. Addressing the parliament, Sunak said, \"In our politics we can argue vigorously as I and Prime Minister did over the past six weeks but still respect each other. Whatever disputes we may have in the parliament I know that everyone in this house I know that everyone in this house will not lose sight of the fact that we are all motivated by our desire to serve our constituents, our country, and advance the principles that we honourably believe in. Every member new and old I congratulate them for the results....My advice to all members is to appreciate the role that you have everyday that you have it... For those of us at my party let me begin with a message to those who are no longer sitting behind me...I am sorry. We have lost too many diligent community-spirited representatives whose wisdom and expertise will be missed in the debates and discussions ahead... Now we will take up the crucial role of official opposition professionally, effectively and humbly.\"",
