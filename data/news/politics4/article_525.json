The policy will provide athletes a cover of Rs 25 lakh, announced state finance minister Diya Kumari here on Wednesday.An amount of Rs 50 crore has also been proposed for Khelo Rajasthan.Former international and Indian squash team coach Surbhi Misra called it a 'great vision'. \\\"The welfare of sport and sportspersons is very clearly reflected in the sports budget. CM Bhajan Lal Sharma, deputy CM Diya Kumari and sports minister RS Rathore have spelled out a great vision for promoting sports in Rajasthan. I'm sure this step will put Rajasthan on the sporting map of India,\\\" she said.The budget also includes an increase in mess allowance to Rs 4,000, one district one sport scheme, an academy for popular sports in each district and Rs 250 crore to establish Maharana Pratap Sports University.National handball player Prachi Gurjar pointed out that an increase in the amount will help athletes improve their diet, 'an important factor in the performance'. \\\"Most athletes struggle to get a proper diet. This step by the government will take care of the nutrition aspect, which is very important. I hope the athletes get what has been promised to them,\\\" Gurjar stated.\\\"Proposal to establish sports university will go a long way in promoting sports and will also help in creating employment to sportspersons,\\\" Misra added.",
