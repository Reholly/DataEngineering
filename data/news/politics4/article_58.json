    "text": "New Delhi : Shri Jayant Chaudhary, Minister of State (Independent Charge), Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE), addressed a zonal conference for Jan Shikshan Sansthan (JSS) at Chaudhary Charan Singh University, Meerut, today. The aim is to create awareness about outreach and the efficacy of JSS in creating self-employment and wage employment opportunities among socio-economically backward groups through skill development training. Moving beyond traditional skills, the conference also emphasized on the relevance of futuristic, industry-relevant skills and their role in better preparing individuals for the evolving job market. The honourable minister also inaugurated the exhibition of products made by JSS candidate from Delhi and UP and interacted with beneficiaries.\nThe Jan Shikshan Sansthan (JSS) Scheme, originally launched as Shramik Vidyapeeth (SVP) in 1967, is a transformative initiative designed to provide skill training through registered Societies (NGOs) with full funding from the Government of India. This pioneering scheme targets non-literates, neo-literates, individuals with rudimentary education, and school dropouts up to class 12th, aged 15-45 years. By offering flexible, affordable, and accessible skill training, JSSs have become a lifeline for women, Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), Other Backward Classes (OBCs), minorities, and other disadvantaged groups in society.\nCurrently, over 290 JSSs are functional in 26 States and 7 UTs including 47 in Uttar Pradesh (UP) and 3 in Delhi. Since the transfer of the scheme from the Ministry of Education (Erstwhile MHRD) to MSDE in July 2018, a total of 26.37 Lakh beneficiaries have been trained under the JSS scheme. The qualified beneficiaries consist of educationally disadvantaged and economically backward groups in rural and urban slums. In line with the key objectives of the scheme, many trained beneficiaries are women 21.63 Lakh (82.02%).\nSpeaking on the progress, Shri Jayant Chaudhary, Minister of State (Independent Charge), Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE), said “”Aligned with the Prime Minister’s vision, we are dedicated to providing better opportunities for the youth of India. Under the JSS scheme, we aim to enhance capacity building and expand skill development opportunities among low-income groups. The processes of skilling, reskilling, and upskilling are essential for personal and economic growth. I applaud the JSS for recognizing the skilled workforce gap in various sectors and acting as a bridge builder, connecting talent with opportunity.”\n“The PMKVY scheme has already benefited over 97,000 people from Meerut and 1.4 crore individuals across India. Also, NAPS (National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS) apprenticeship program plays a vital role in encouraging the employees to enhance their skill to match the ever-evolving industry requirements.” he added.\nShri Atul Kumar Tiwari, Secretary, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, Government of India, added , “I recognize and commend the outstanding work of JSS in empowering the low-income communities in India. Through their strong community connections, JSS has been training the youth, especially women, in industry-relevant skills like marketing to not only increase their employability but also to bring about their holistic empowerment. I encourage them to continue this invaluable work and promote strong livelihood opportunities.”\nShri Kapil Dev Aggarwal, MoS (IC), Vocational Education and Skill Development Department, Govt. of UP. Member of Legislative Assembly from Muzaffarnagar Constituency , said “Our Honorable Prime Minister’s focus on skill development is unwavering. He consistently highlights the crucial role skilling plays in the growth of our nation. The National Education Policy 2020 emphasized the importance of vocational training, urging it to be embraced across levels from secondary education to high degrees. I acknowledge JSSs’ remarkable work in making skilling available to low-income groups. I persuade our young generation to adopt vocational studies and become job providers from job seekers for a better tomorrow.”\nA key strength of the JSS Scheme lies in its community connect and the involvement of local administration, village functionaries, and other stakeholders. This ensures effective mobilization of infrastructure, resources, and beneficiaries, enabling them to seek various job opportunities in various sectors such as food processing, textile, IT and more. Additionally, JSSs conduct activities to raise awareness on critical social, economic, health, financial literacy, and environmental issues.\nThe Zonal Conference served as a platform for sharing best practices, addressing challenges, and strategizing for the future. These conferences aim to enhance the implementation and outreach of the JSS Scheme, ensuring it continues to empower the targeted communities effectively.\nIn the previous financial year, the Ministry conducted Zonal Conferences from 13th March to 22nd March, 2024, at four diverse locations: Hyderabad, Goa, Udaipur, and Guwahati. These conferences reviewed the performance of JSSs and gathered valuable feedback and suggestions for improving the scheme’s outcomes.",
