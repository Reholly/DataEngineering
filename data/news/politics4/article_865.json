    "text": "India, represented by a high-level delegation led by Shri T.K. Ramachandaran, Secretary of the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways, has taken a prominent role in shaping international maritime policies at the 132nd session of the Council of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in London. The session, which began on July 8, 2024, and continues until July 12, 2024, addresses critical issues and proposals for the future of global maritime operations. Addressing Seafarer Abandonment India, an elected member of the IMO Council due to its substantial interest in international seaborne trade, highlighted the urgent issue of seafarer abandonment. The Indian delegation noted 44 active cases involving 292 Indian seafarers, emphasizing the need for robust measures to protect maritime workers worldwide. India’s strong stance on this issue was well-received, securing its position in the Joint Tripartite Working Group dedicated to addressing seafarers’ welfare and human element issues. Commitment to Maritime Safety and Security The delegation also addressed concerns over disruptions in the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, and adjoining areas, impacting shipping and trade logistics. India highlighted its commitment to maritime safety and security by citing two significant incidents where the Indian Navy successfully intervened. These included the rescue of the Marshall Island-flagged crude oil carrier MV Marlyn Luanda and the interception of the vessel MV Ruen off the coast of Somalia, ensuring the safety of crew members and handling piracy threats effectively. South Asian Centre of Excellence for Sustainable Maritime Transport India reiterated its proposal for the South Asian Centre of Excellence for Sustainable Maritime Transport (SACE-SMarT). This regional hub aims to transform the maritime sector in South Asia into a technologically advanced, environmentally sustainable, and digitally proficient industry. The centre will focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, fostering technical cooperation, capacity-building, and digital transition. T.K. Ramachandaran stated, “India remains deeply committed to addressing the issue of seafarer abandonment and ensuring the safety and welfare of our maritime workforce.” India’s Leadership in Maritime Innovation India’s participation in the IMO Council session underscores its dedication to international maritime cooperation and innovation. The establishment of SACE-SMarT in collaboration with the IMO’s global Maritime Technology Cooperation Centres (MTCCs) highlights India’s leadership in promoting environmentally sustainable and technologically advanced maritime practices. India’s proactive stance and contributions at the session reflect its significant role in evolving global maritime governance and driving positive change in the maritime sector. Looking Ahead The 132nd session of the IMO Council continues to address various critical issues and proposals for the future of global maritime operations, with India’s contributions being a pivotal part of the discourse.",
