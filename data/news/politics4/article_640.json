    "text": "Philippines Rejects Force in South China Sea Dispute: A Commitment to Peace The Philippines rejects the use of force in the contested South China Sea but aims to avoid conflict and has agreed with China to ease tensions, particularly around Second Thomas Shoal. National Security Adviser Eduardo Ano emphasized the importance of dialogue and diplomacy while upholding the 2016 Hague ruling invalidating Beijing's claims. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Updated: 12-07-2024 10:27 IST | Created: 12-07-2024 10:27 IST The Philippines has firmly opposed the use of force to undermine its interests in the contested South China Sea, emphasizing a non-confrontational approach even as tensions mount. National Security Adviser Eduardo Ano confirmed that both nations have agreed to de-escalate tensions around Second Thomas Shoal, a contentious area. Efforts to reduce friction come after recent confrontations, including allegations that the China Coast Guard intentionally rammed a Philippine navy vessel, injuring a sailor. Despite China's extensive claims over the sea, the Philippines remains committed to upholding the 2016 Hague ruling, which dismissed Beijing's territorial assertions. Ano stressed the importance of maintaining peace and resolving issues through diplomatic means. The European Union and the United States have also called for China to honor the Hague ruling, urging Beijing to cease its destabilizing actions in the disputed waters.
