    "text": "WASHINGTON - US President Joe Biden was “in charge” and on top of matters at a Nato summit with fellow leaders in Washington, French President Emmanuel Macron said on July 11.\n“I was able to talk with President Biden at length yesterday at dinner,” Mr Macron told reporters. “I saw as always a president who is in charge, clear on the issues he knows well.”\nThe French leader was also asked about a gaffe made by Mr Biden just minutes earlier when he mistakenly introduced Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky as his Russian foe Vladimir Putin, before quickly correcting himself.\nThe blunder intensified concerns about Mr Biden’s age and mental acuity after a disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump two weeks ago.\n“We all slip up sometimes,” Mr Macron said. “It’s happened to me, and it could happen again tomorrow. I would ask for your indulgence.”\nMr Macron also said that France will continue to support Ukraine “as long as necessary.”\nAsked about recent visits to Russia and China by Mr Viktor Orban, Mr Macron said the Hungarian prime minister did not go there with any “mandate” from the EU.
