    "text": "Oklahoma’s top education official Ryan Walters praises right-wing media figures as among “the best minds” to develop the “best history standards in the country” Published On July 9, Oklahoma’s superintendent of public instruction Ryan Walters [announced](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24796756-walters-announces-revisions-to-social-studies-standards25) that a number of people — many of them key figures in right-wing media — would be rewriting the social studies curriculum in the state. The list includes right-wing hosts with ties to Walters like Steve Deace, Dennis Prager, and Stacy Washington, as well as Kevin Roberts, the head of The Heritage Foundation, which has organized Project 2025. (For more on the right-wing figures helping guide Oklahoma's curriculum, see [here](https://www.mediamatters.org/education/oklahoma-having-right-wing-media-figures-rewrite-its-social-studies-curriculum-heres-what).) Walters appeared on the July 11 episode of Jenna Ellis in the Morning and discussed the plans for a new curriculum, using rhetoric that appears to [mirror](https://www.salon.com/2022/09/13/without-the-bible-there-is-no-america-josh-hawley-goes-full-christian-nationalist-at-natcon/) Christian nationalism and expressing excitement with the group of right-wing figures that will help develop the curriculum.",
