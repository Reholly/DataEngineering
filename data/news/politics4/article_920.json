    "text": "Expressing his appreciation for the invaluable support and affection that the former senior leaders of Laos have extended to Vietnam, President Lam acknowledged their significant contributions to nurturing and strengthening the steadfast, special solidarity between the two nations. On this occasion, he conveyed greetings from Vietnamese Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh, and National Assembly Chairman Tran Thanh Man to his hosts. President To Lam expressed confidence that under the wise leadership of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party, the nation will continue to develop independently and prosperously, bringing well-being and happiness for its people. He also congratulated Laos on its achievements in recent years, attributing these successes to the significant contributions of the former leaders. The former Lao leaders said that they have been closely following the excellent development of the Vietnam-Laos great friendship, special solidarity, and comprehensive cooperation. Expressing gratitude for the valuable support provided by the Vietnamese Party, State, and people to Laos, they emphasised the need for both sides to continue nurturing the unique friendship, enhancing the effectiveness of cooperation, and implementing agreements and treaties between the two countries. They also stressed the importance of educating and raising awareness among the people of both nations, especially the younger generations, about the unparalleled, loyal, and pure relationship./. /",
