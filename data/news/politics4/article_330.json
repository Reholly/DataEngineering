    "text": "In a compelling interview on \"The Joe Pags Show,\" Representative Nancy Mace (R-SC-01) shared her perspectives on the current state of Congress, emphasizing the urgent need for action over rhetoric. Mace discussed the SAVE Act, a key piece of legislation she addressed during the conversation.\nMace expressed frustration with the lack of progress in Congress, criticizing the excessive talk and minimal action. \"I'm tired of all talk and no action,\" she stated, highlighting her dissatisfaction with the current political climate. She revealed her past challenges with Kevin McCarthy, including his attempts to help unseat her in her district, where her opponent spent $7 million in the effort.\nTurning to the economy, Mace argued that President Biden's policies have been detrimental to Americans, advocating for a return to Trump's leadership, which she believes would benefit the country. She highlighted the behind-the-scenes maneuvering in politics, asserting that Trump would address these issues effectively.\nMace also ignited a call to action for Republicans, urging them to move beyond talk and implement real change. She praised Nancy Pelosi for maintaining party discipline and stressed the importance of Republicans doing the same.\nOn the topic of transparency, Mace declared that Americans deserve to know the truth about President Biden's capabilities and questioned Hunter Biden's presence in the White House, suggesting he should face legal consequences.\nTo hear Rep. Nancy Mace's full interview with Joe Pags, click the link below.",
