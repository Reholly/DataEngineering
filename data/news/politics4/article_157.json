    "text": "Federal officials tout apprenticeships at Penn College Published 07.11.2024 Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su and Director of the Domestic Policy Counsel/White House Domestic Policy Advisor Neera Tanden took a few moments to answer questions following their July 11, 2024, [announcement event](https://www.pct.edu/news/article/2024/07/11/college-awarded-4-million-grant-for-apprenticeship-expansion) at Pennsylvania College of Technology. The officials announced nationwide grant funding for apprenticeship initiatives totaling $244 million. Penn College is the recipient of a $4 million grant to expand its existing apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship programs. The following is a full transcript of the interview conducted by Tom Speicher, writer/video producer at Penn College: Tom Speicher: Can you describe what you expect the economic impact of this investment in apprenticeships will be? Julie Su: So, under President Biden's Investing in America agenda, there's $16.7 billion coming to Pennsylvania. And those are creating good jobs in communities that need them the most. And PCT is one of the on-ramps to those good jobs. And so our $4 million investment in PCT to create more pre-apprenticeship programs into apprenticeships is going to help young people get jobs, get good jobs in their communities. That's going to help them to build financial security, a pathway to the middle class, be able to support their families and to be able to get their piece of the American dream. Neera Tanden: And so when we invest in apprenticeships, we're not only investing in those people, those young people and their opportunities, which builds economic growth. We're also providing a crucial need to business for the skills that they require. So it really is a win-win. It's building economic growth for the long-term. Tom Speicher: How long do you think it will take for this investment to have a tangible impact on the manufacturing workforce? Julie Su: So the good news is because PCT has already been doing this work, this investment builds on other investments that we have already made and on the incredible work that, that you, that they, have already been doing. And so we expect immediate impact because of their partnerships with industry, because they, you know, they understand the needs of employers and they're a trusted resource in the community. But this is not a one-time investment just for now. It really is an investment in the future and in the jobs of the future. And so, you know, the president's investments are about decades-long impact, and we're going to need those workers for the long haul. And so apprenticeships are not just about one time, you know, the immediate job needs. They're about careers that people can retire from with dignity. Neera Tanden: This school can hit the, really does hit the ground running because, as the secretary said, it has a robust program already. But the new investments really do match the new investments we're making as a country, the Biden-Harris Administration are making in manufacturing, in chips and science. So it's really, this institution is incredibly well-matched and that's why these investments are so crucial. Tom Speicher: One last question, and you kind of answered it already, but why was it so important to make this announcement here at Penn College? Julie Su: Yeah, well, we are just so proud of the work here at PCT. It really represents so many of the things that we want to see happen, which is, again, you know, jobs aligned, educational opportunities, equity, right? Real opportunity for people who've been left out or left behind in the past. And also the idea that President Biden talks about all the time which is that somebody should be able to get a good job in their community. They shouldn't have to leave it in order to find security, to be able to build their future. And so all of the work at PCT is about investing in the community in Williamsport and also throughout Pennsylvania. Neera Tanden: And honestly, Penn College has been a leader on these issues across the country. The way it's innovating. The way it's developed relationships with business over many, many years. It really understands the needs of business. It's nimble in trying to provide skills in real time. It understands how businesses need change and skills need change. But they also, you know, are a trusted partner. So people come here and know that there's going to be a job at the end of their training. And really, this is the pathway to a strong middle-class job. Tom Speicher: Thank you both very much. Neera Tanden: Thank you very much. Appreciate it.",
