    "text": "On behalf of the United States of America, I congratulate the people of Montenegro as you celebrate your Statehood Day. We are encouraged by Montenegro's continued forward progress on its path to EU accession and we look forward to seeing Montenegro take its place as a full member of the European community. As you continue to promote economic integration through the region and demonstrate your commitment to democratic values, Montenegro is securing a prosperous future for its people. We are proud to see Montenegro as a leader in the region, meeting its 2% GDP defense spending goal in NATO and advancing Euro-Atlantic integration throughout the Western Balkans. Today, we celebrate our strong and enduring friendship. /Public Release.
