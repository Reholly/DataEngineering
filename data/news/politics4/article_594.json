    "text": "The Euros 2024 final is around the corner and the Three Lions will meet Spain on Sunday evening, with the weather forecast looking bright, football fans can hopefully look forward to enjoying a glorious weekend with a barbecue party. Amazon has offered limited-time Ninja deals to barbie fans who are looking to upgrade their grills and BBQ set. It&#039;s the Ninja Woodfire Electric BBQ Grill &amp; Smoker, a 7-in-1 non-stick outdoor grill and airfryer. Shoppers can save 40% and get this fuss-free outdoor cooker for £238 instead of £399.99, it&#039;s so good that even David Beckham used it to grill mushrooms for his homemade pizza. The Ninja Website is selling it for £249.99 but you can get a free cover and an adjustable stand. Food lovers will appreciate the grill &amp; smoker as the integrated smoker box burns &quot;100% real wood pellets for natural woodfire flavours&quot;. You can fit up to 16 sausages or two racks of spare ribs and let it cook in low heat for tender results; or you can smoke them quickly to add flavours. The 7-in-1 grill and smoker are perfect if you are craving for steaks, hot dogs or fried chicken But customers were impressed when they found out the Ninja Woodfire Grill &amp; Smoker can also be used as an air fryer. One fan shared: &quot;I air fried some chicken wings, perfect and also did some pork chops on the grill as well. It&#039;s never stopped since I got it!&quot; Another five-star user called it a &quot;game changer for outdoor cooking&quot; and he said: &quot;I was sceptical about whether an outdoor electric appliance could replace my regular barbecue grill, which I loved using for high quality Brazilian and Argentinian cuts with delicious fat. &quot;The best part is that I haven&#039;t even used the pellets and smoke function yet, as the meat tastes just like it was made on a charcoal grill.&quot; And one happy husband shared: &quot;I have BBQ-ed for many years and my wife purchased this for me as a 25-year anniversary present. It&#039;s fantastic to use and great fun, leaves no mess and very versatile. I love it.&quot; You can save £160 and grill it like Beckham Powered by electricity, the Woodfire Electric BBQ Grill &amp; Smoker is quick to heat up and costs from roughly 41p per session. The weather-resistant material means you don&#039;t have to store it in the house or the shed and it&#039;s perfect to use in gardens and on patios. Looking for a powerful BBQ grill? John Lewis offers a Grillstream 3 Burner Hybrid Gas and Charcoal BBQ and it has 16 glowing 5-star reviews online. Chefree&#039;s Health Grill and Air Fryer is a budget option to the Ninja Woodfire, it&#039;s also on a limited time deal and it&#039;s been reduced from £109.99 to £75.99.",
