We have more newsletters\nShow Me No thanks, close See our Privacy Notice STEVE RACE IS THE LABOUR MP FOR EXETER\nFirstly, I’d like to thank everyone who went out to vote in the general election last week, and of course in particular those people who chose to vote Labour. I’m incredibly grateful and humbled to have the opportunity to serve everyone in Exeter, no matter who you voted for.\nAs the candidate in Exeter for two years, I’ve had the fantastic opportunity to meet many residents across the city. But it doesn’t stop there - I’m looking forward to continuing knocking on doors and talking to residents about their concerns so that I can take all that back to parliament to help with my work.\nIt’s clear that the country voted to turn the page on 14 years of Tory government last week. For many people, it will be a relief to move on from the chaos and bad decision-making that had marked the last few years.\nFor the first time, not only is Labour the biggest party in England, in Scotland, and in Wales but also we’re now the biggest group in the South West region. This offers a big opportunity to work with a Labour government to advocate for the South West and work in partnership to solve some of our big challenges - but also to help develop and meet our enormous potential.\nI know that many people are struggling - with the cost of living, meaning people are struggling to get by, and with NHS waiting lists, leaving many people living longer with their conditions than necessary.\nI’m pleased that this Labour government is already making an impact - lifting the ban on onshore wind, getting round the table with the junior doctors, and reaching out to discuss the problems with NHS dentistry. Just the sort of action we want to see to start rebuilding our country, and getting our economy growing sustainably.\nThis is just the start of our work. Over the coming weeks and months, this Labour government will start on the path of delivering on our first steps - increasing the number of teachers in our schools, adding new appointments into the NHS system to get existing lists down; tackling anti-social behaviour with new resources for the police; and setting up Great British Energy to take control of our electricity system, decarbonise our generation, and bring down household bills.\nI’ve been a part of Exeter for 17 years, first working for Ben Bradshaw and then later in various other roles. I want to thank Ben for all of his work over 27 years as Exeter’s MP - one of the longest-serving in our history. He has left an indelible mark due to his hard work and his focus on our communities and life chances. I’m looking forward to picking up his mantle and playing my own part in our future success, in partnership with many of our fantastic businesses and organisations across the city. Please do be in touch if you think I can help!\nStory Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks.
