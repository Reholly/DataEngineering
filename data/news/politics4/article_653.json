    "text": "As a former Binghamton City Councilmember, Webb has addressed critical issues that families face. From removing blighted properties and supporting their redevelopment into homes for her community to addressing food desert issues by establishing community gardens, Webb has improved the lives of those she serves. She has passed legislation supporting equal pay for women, creating a city-based human rights commission, establishing a city-wide climate action plan, and supporting small business development and job creation. Webb understands the importance of expanding opportunities for civic engagement and has served as a trainer and advocate to increase marginalized voices in elected office. A lifelong Southern Tier NY resident and proud graduate of public school, Webb is a first generation graduate of SUNY Broome, where she earned a degree in liberal arts and sciences, and Binghamton University, where she earned a degree in neuroscience. Lea is now an educator at Binghamton University, where she develops diversity and inclusion training and programs for faculty, staff, and students to advance its goals of fostering diversity and respect. She is a national trainer with Vote Run Lead, training thousands of women across the country on how to run for elected office. She is a Co-Chair/Co-Founder of the Black Millennial Political Convention and a Founding Board Member of Local Progress. Lea was honored with the Presidents Award by the Broome-Tioga Branch of the NAACP for her significant contributions to her community. https://www.leawebb.com/",
