    "text": "By Ismail Shakil (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Thursday he had confidence in Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland and that the two would continue to work together, damping reports of tensions between her and the prime minister's aides. Canada's Globe and Mail, citing unidentified sources, reported earlier on Thursday that the relationship between Freeland and the prime minister's office had become strained over what the newspaper said was the perception that she had been ineffective in delivering an upbeat economic message. Speaking to reporters in Washington, Trudeau said Freeland has been a close friend and partner in doing \"really big things for Canada\" and she would continue her work on housing and the economy, among other areas. Trudeau, in power since 2015, shuffled much of his cabinet last year with the aim of increasing focus on economic issues, such as a housing shortage and the rising cost of living - issues that have hurt his standing with voters. The prime minister brought seven new people into cabinet, but kept prominent ministers including Freeland in their portfolios. \"She is a critical and essential member of my team and I'm fully confident in her abilities,\" Trudeau said of Freeland, who also serves as deputy prime minister. The Globe reported that concern over Freeland had stemmed from low approval ratings for the Liberal government, especially after it lost a once-safe Toronto constituency in a special election last month. The newspaper said there had been discussions internally about bringing in former Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney to replace Freeland as finance minister, a post she has held for nearly four years. Trudeau said he had been talking with Carney for years to convince him to join federal politics and that he would be an \"outstanding addition at a time when Canadians need good people to step up.\" The next federal election must be held by the end of October 2025. A range of polls show the Liberals would lose badly to the main opposition Conservative Party. (Reporting by Ismail Shakil in Ottawa; Editing by Frank McGurty and Rod Nickel)",
