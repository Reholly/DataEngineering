    "text": "An ominous story concluded happily on Thursday when\nTori Towey returned to Ireland from Dubai.\nThe 28-year-old from Roscommon said she was “glad to be back” when she landed at Dublin Airport after a nightmare sojourn in the United Arab Emirates. Hospitalised after an alleged domestic violence incident earlier this year, lately she had been detained in Dubai and charged with alcohol consumption and attempted suicide.\nWhen her case was raised in the Dáil recently, there were strong statements of support for her, but a good deal of hard work also had to be done to secure her release. Ms Towey was full of praise for those who had done that work, crediting the Irish embassy in the United Arab Emirates specifically as well as her family, politicians, media, and the Irish people.\n“I feel bad for people who don’t have the support that we have,” Ms Towey said.\nThe power of State support for an Irish citizen in a very difficult situation should not be underestimated. Radha Stirling of the human rights organisation Detained in Dubai, who has been helping the Toweys, said on Thursday: “When a government gets behind their citizens, when they go the extra mile, they are successful in getting citizens home.”\nIt should also be pointed out that Ireland’s standing as an honest broker in international affairs is another major advantage in cases such as Ms Towey’s. That standing stems in part from a stubborn independence which leads to decisions such as recognising Palestine rather than slavishly following the line adopted by larger nations.\nSuch decisions lend an extra power to Irish negotiations in cases such as Ms Towey’s.\nThey show clearly that Ireland’s foreign policy is driven by principle rather than expediency, a difference which many other states appreciate.\nIn\na wide-ranging interview with the Irish Examiner’s Elaine Loughlin this week, Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl made a general point that anyone considering entering politics should bear in mind.\nHe stated that those who wish to enter politics should be able to do so safely, that neither those budding politicians themselves nor their families should be threatened or abused.\nMid-July approaches and we have yet to see true summer weather settle over the country. Notwithstanding the variable temperatures and scant sunlight, Irish holidaymakers are making the most of the country’s beaches — or at least they were until this week’s news of sharks off the coast.\nAnd not just any sharks. Those in the frame are great whites, the apex predators made infamous by Jaws almost 50 years ago.\nShivers ran down spines when\nfootage surfaced purporting to show a great white lurking off the Galway coast. That footage has been widely questioned since, with doubts emerging about the real location.\nHowever, a group of research scientists is preparing an expedition to seek out great whites off the Irish coast in the coming months.\nIn a curious choice of words, one of the researchers said he was “optimistic” about finding them in Irish waters, adding: “There’s really nothing about the water temperatures, food options or habitat that makes me think they aren’t here.”\n(The researcher is Nick Payne. It is not clear if any of the other crew members are called Brody, Hooper, or Quint.)\nThe poor weather has been challenging enough for all of us hoping for respite after a long winter. Now we have to contend with man-eating sharks as well?",
