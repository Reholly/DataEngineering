    "text": "More details are emerging about the changes made to the controversial Mulé amendment, which could be enough to prevent FIFA and UEFA excluding Serie A and Italy over Government interference.\nThere are very strict rules in European and World football to ensure the sporting federations have total independence from politics.\nA letter from FIFA and UEFA to Minister for Sport Andrea Abodi had warned that the so-called Mulé amendment would breach those rules and “if the text remains the same, we would have to exclude Italian teams from European cup competition.”\nIt could also see Italy stripped of the hosting rights for the EURO 2032 tournament, which they currently hold in conjunction with Turkey.\nThe Mulé amendment was passed this evening , but although the politician behind it – Giorgio Mulé – declares it a huge victory, the wording appears to have changed significantly from the original.\nMany of the points that caused problems have been removed, including the ability for clubs to bypass the sporting justice system and appeal directly to the TAR tribunal – a civil court.\nThe clause allowing the Lega Serie A to forge independence from the Federation, an attempt to copy the way the Premier League broke away from the English Football Association, has also seemingly been cut, along with the Serie A power of veto over reforms.\nControversial amendment stripped down for Serie A The only remaining element of interest is the ruling that the Lega Serie A must have ‘adequate representation’ within the FIGC board.\n“Now it will be easier for the Federation, if they want also with our contribution, to find a balanced and common sense solution to the issue treated by the amendment, and even bigger questions that have not found answers over the years in the football system,” said Minister for Sport Abodi.\nLega Serie A President Lorenzo Casini still considered the watered-down version a victory for his position.\n“This will give more representation to the Lega Serie A in the federal system. It represents, after years, a first important achievement. This is the first, indispensable, step in the journey of reforms that Serie A has been requesting for a long time.”\nCasini even said that this is the Italian football equivalent of the Boston Tea Party, quoting the phase “no taxation without representation.”",
