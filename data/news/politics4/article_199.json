    "text": "The Labour Party (LP) has hailed the Supreme Court verdict granting financial autonomy to Local Governments in the country.\nNational Publicity Secretary of the Labour Party, Obiora Ifoh, said the ruling has put to rest the debate as to whether or not local government areas that are the closest level of government to the ordinary people deserved to enjoy some form of autonomy to address challenges facing the masses within their jurisdiction.\nThe statement reads: “We at the Labour Party (LP) welcome the Supreme Court decision granting financial autonomy to Local Government Councils in the 36 States of the federation including the Federal Capital Territory.\n“This decision was long in coming but like a saying goes, it is better late than never.\n“It has put to rest the debate as to whether or not local government areas that are the closest level of government to the ordinary people deserve to enjoy some form of autonomy to address challenges facing the masses within their jurisdiction.\n“We can now safely say local government areas now have greater freedom to initiate and complete projects which will reduce suffering at the grass roots.\nRelated News “This autonomy comes with a huge responsibility on local government councils just as councillors now owe their constituents a duty to hold local government chairmen accountable by ensuring prudent management of their resources.\n“The expectation of Nigerians from the local government administration now is simple.\n“They each must now take up the challenge of this new found independence to ensure judicious use of public funds in their custody.\n“We would also like to urge council chairmen not to see the additional inflow of public funds as an opportunity to engage in reckless spending and embarking on white elephant projects which can negate the whole essence of the financial autonomy granted them.”",
