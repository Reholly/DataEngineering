    "text": "Orbán met with Trump and he has good news: Trump will sort it out!\nJuly 12. 2024. – 08:47 AM\n[]\nupdated\nHungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán has completed yet another leg of his tour, which began in Ukraine, continued through Moscow and Beijing to Washington, and which he has dubbed a “peace mission” (regarding the Russian-Ukrainian war). All the while,\n[ EU member states have frowned on his blurring of lines](/english/2024/07/11/blurring-lines-between-orbans-peace-mission-and-eu-presidency-condemned-by-all-but-one-member-state) between bilateral meetings and Hungary's presidency of the EU.\nHis latest stop was former US president Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, which he reported on very succinctly in a statement released by the Hungarian State News Agency, MTI (\"The conversation at the Mar-a-Lago meeting was about the possibilities for peace\") and on his Facebook page, which is his main communication channel (\"Discussion with President Trump about peace. Today’s good news: he will sort it out!\").\nThe Hungarian prime minister has been a vocal supporter of Trump's election campaign from the outset, and even Trump's conviction on 34 counts in a criminal trial in New York has not deterred him.\nOrbán has repeatedly said that Trump is the world's great hope for peace, and that if elected president, he will be able to bring peace in a matter of days. Trump has also talked about this repeatedly, but he hasn't divulged exactly how and under what conditions he envisages achieving this peace.\nFor more quick, accurate and impartial news from and about Hungary,\n[subscribe to the Telex English newsletter!](/dokumentum/subscribe-to-our-newsletters)",
