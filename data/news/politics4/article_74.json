    "text": "Islamabad:British Minister for International Development and Women and Equalities Anneliese Jane Dodds has said the country's new Labour government is committed to driving change and prioritising global development and equality. “I'll be focused on rebuilding our country's development reputation, making the world a safer, more prosperous place, and unlocking opportunities for everyone,” Ms Dodds said in a message following her appointment as a member of new British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Mr Starmer's Labour Party secured a landslide victory in the recent UK parliamentary elections, ending the 14-year reign of Conservatives. Ms Dodds emphasised the need for a fresh approach, built on mutual respect and partnership with the Global South, to address pressing global issues such as poverty, instability, climate change, and nature conservation. \"Our mission will be to create a world free from poverty on a liveable planet,\" she said. Ms Dodds said her government's key development priorities included supporting economic transformation, addressing unsustainable debt, unlocking climate finance, providing humanitarian assistance, enhancing conflict prevention capabilities, and empowering women and girls.
