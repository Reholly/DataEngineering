    "text": "United States Ambassador to the Philippines MaryKay Carlson highlighted the enduring significance of the 2016 Arbitral Award, not only for Filipinos in the West Philippine Sea, but the entire stakeholders in the Indo-Pacific region.\nCarlson issued the statement at a Stratbase forum on Friday to mark the 8 th anniversary of the ruling. In her remarks, she reinforced the US government’s support for the Philippines and underscored the critical role of international law in ensuring regional stability and freedom of navigation.\nShe emphasized that the July 12, 2016, arbitral ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, Netherlands is not merely a legal milestone for the Philippines but a landmark decision for the entire Indo-Pacific region.\nThe ruling, which overwhelmingly favored the Philippines, clarified the country’s sovereign rights and jurisdiction over its exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and continental shelf. This legal foundation is crucial in asserting the Philippines’ maritime entitlements against China’s expansive claims.\n“We are proud to be among the chorus of nations that have consistently lent their voices to calling out incidents or aggression. The volume of condemnation from the international community is loud and getting louder, and it speaks to our common resolve in support of the international rules and norms that benefit us all,” Carlson stated.\nHighlighting the economic significance of the issue, Carlson pointed out that the South China Sea is one of the busiest shipping lanes globally, facilitating over $3 trillion in annual trade. It is also home to rich biodiversity and accounts for 12% of the global fish catch, supporting millions of livelihoods.\nThe legal clarity provided by the arbitral ruling underpins the economic activities that thrive in the region, benefitting both the Philippines and the broader international community.\nCalrson also announced the Luzon Economic Corridor, a key initiative from the Trilateral Leaders’ Summit between US President Joe Biden, Philippine President Marcos, and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.\nThis corridor aims to boost infrastructure development in the Philippines, focusing on port, rail, and digital infrastructure, further enhancing the economic benefits derived from the region’s stability.\n“As we have often heard President Marcos say, economic security is national security. For the past eight years, the Arbitral award has been a lynchpin in the Philippines’ national security vision for a peaceful and prosperous archipelagic nation – one that the United States steadfastly supports,” Carlson said.\nShe talked about the deepening economic ties between the US and the Philippines, noting that the Washington remains Manila’s largest export market.\nRecent engagements, such as the sixth Indo-Pacific Business Forum in Manila, have launched $20 million in new US economic programs and celebrated over $5 billion in new investments, emphasizing America’s commitment to supporting the Philippines’ economic growth.\nOn the defense front, Carlson underscored the importance of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA), which has seen $120 million in investments to bolster the Philippines’ disaster response and critical infrastructure.\nThis agreement facilitates closer training and modernization efforts between Filipino and American forces, reinforcing the Philippines’ national security.\nThe ambassador also highlighted recent multilateral maritime cooperation involving the United States, Philippines, Japan, Australia, Canada, and France. These activities showcase a united front in upholding international maritime laws and ensuring freedom of navigation.\nReaffirming the US’ stance, Carlson called on China to cease its aggressive actions in the region. She condemned the harassment of Philippine vessels operating lawfully within the Philippines’ EEZ and urged China to respect the 2016 arbitral ruling. Secretary of State Blinken, in a statement on the same day, reiterated this call, emphasizing the importance of abiding by international law.\n“We applaud President Marcos and the Government of the Philippines for defending the well-being of its service members on the BRP Sierra Madre,” said Carlson.\nThe US ambassador said she will be meeting with Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Western Command Chief Rear Admiral Alfonso Torres, Jr. and the ship’s crew via video conference “to thank them for the important role they play in defending Philippine rights – and by extension, the rights of all of us – under international law.”",
