    "text": "The greatest salesman who ever lived scored big after the latest NATO summit. Ukraine’s Zelensky successfully convinced all NATO nations to pledge a collective $43 billion in funding to the never-ending war effort. These world leaders are openly willing to abandon their own nation’s economic needs in favor of Ukraine.\nCanada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been asked to step down from office due to the current state of Canada’s economy. Doubling down on his poor decisions, Trudeau has offered to purchase submarines and missiles for Zelensky. In fact, Canadian taxpayers are now on the hook for a C$500 million aid package . “The leaders discussed the defence needs of Ukraine and coordinated cooperation within the fighter jets coalition,” the Office of the President reported.\nNever to be outdone in terms of spending, the US already passed a $61 billion aid package for Ukraine back in April. They are continuing to send funds and expensive equipment overseas. US Secretary of State Blinken promised Zelensky the first found of F-16 fighter jets, which could range from $25 to $70 million a piece. Denmark and the Netherlands will aid in transferring the jets to Zelensky.\n“In addition, in the coming months, the United States and partners intend to provide Ukraine with dozens of tactical air defense systems,” Biden said. This will include German-made self-propelled Gepard anti-aircraft guns, NASAMS medium-range air defense systems, and variants of IRIS-T systems. All of NATO is ramping up Ukraine’s air force with at least 80 new jets en route.\nNATO said that the $43 billion is merely a “minimum baseline funding” as the blank checks will not cease. The current budget will fund a portion of the war into 2026, a clear indication that peace is not an option. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg admitted that the quickest way to end a war, preventing countless deaths, would be to “lose” a war. Yet, Stoltenberg insists that NATO cannot “yield to Putin.” We heard Biden claim during the last debate that Putin is hell-bent on conquering all of Europe despite Putin openly asking for a truce if NATO stops its aggressive tactics.\nThe summit leaders also mentioned that China is in their sites, calling President Xi a “decisive enabler.” NATO is warning China that it must cease funding Russia and then went as far as to question China’s nuclear arsenal and space expansion. The leaders are now asking Xi to arrange discussions to see how they may disarm China diplomatically.\nThe cycle of war has only just begun.",
