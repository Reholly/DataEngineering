Can we believe them?\nJoe Biden. (Las Vegas Review-Journal) More Stories LETTER: A circus at the Clark County government center LETTER: Presidential immunity ruling applies to Democrats, too LETTER: How can we report plate scofflaws? LETTER: Yes to red-light cameras Douglas Bell Henderson July 11, 2024 - 9:01 pm In vaudeville, everyone knew that an actor got the hook when his time on stage was over.
