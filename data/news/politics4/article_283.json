    "text": "New Zealand PM Luxon Calls for Strong Stand on International Rules in Indo-Pacific New Zealand's Prime Minister, Christopher Luxon, emphasized the need to uphold the international rules-based order amidst potential military threats in the Indo-Pacific. Attending the NATO summit, Luxon highlighted New Zealand's commitment to international stability and extended support to Ukraine and U.S.-led coalitions in the Red Sea. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Updated: 12-07-2024 05:32 IST | Created: 12-07-2024 05:32 IST New Zealand's Prime Minister Christopher Luxon affirmed on Thursday that his country must advocate for the international rules-based order as potential military conflicts threaten the Indo-Pacific region. 'We need to stand up for this international rules-based system that has served New Zealand incredibly well. When it is under threat, you've got to call it out, stand up, and make your contribution,' Luxon told media following two days of meetings at the NATO summit in Washington. While not a member of the NATO alliance, New Zealand is part of the Indo-Pacific Four (IP-4) group, which includes Japan, South Korea, and Australia. The IP-4 met with NATO and EU leaders, and Luxon held bilateral meetings with leaders from Canada, France, and Spain. Following the IP-4 session, Luxon stated that collaboration among the region's advanced democracies is essential for supporting international stability. New Zealand is committed to being a trusted partner to its allies. Additionally, New Zealand announced it would extend its contribution to U.S.-led coalitions in the Red Sea and added NZ$16 million ($9.74 million) in support for Ukraine, alongside new sanctions against individuals and entities aiding Russia. Luxon cautioned against potential conflicts in East Asia, referencing issues with North Korea, China, and Taiwan. (Disclaimer: With inputs from agencies.)
