    "text": "New UK Labour government will focus on healthtech and dementia treatment as part of UK healthcare reform Copenhagen, Denmark, 12 July 2024 – Brain+ A/S (Nasdaq First North: BRAINP) - Building a National Health Service (NHS) fit for the future is a top priority for the new UK Labour government - As part of their healthcare plan, Labour wants to harness the power of healthtech to offer better disease prevention and management and put Britain at the forefront of dementia treatment - Brain+’ pipeline of healthtech solutions for better dementia management have offerings perfectly aligned with the new political healthcare agenda in the UK - The planned launch of the CST-Assistant, Brain+’ first product into the UK market, by end Q3 2024 is set to occur on the backdrop of a highly supportive political environment The recently elected new Labour government in the United Kingdom (UK) has set out to reform the country’s National Health System (NHS) to ensure a better fit for the future. The NHS covers around 80% of all healthcare in the country and was originally built by the Labour government back in 1945. As part of the objectives stated in its political healthcare manifesto, Labour plans to 1) harness the power of health technology, 2) establish stronger disease preventive measures, 3) provide support for better chronic disease management, 4) provide healthcare closer to peoples’ homes and 5) develop an NHS innovation and adoption strategy, including a clearer integration route for new technologies into the NHS. Labour further aims to prioritize dementia care and make Britain a global leader in dementia treatment innovation. Extract from the UK Labour Party healthcare manifesto: “As part of Labour’s life sciences plan, we will develop an NHS innovation and adoption strategy in England. This will include a plan for procurement, giving a clearer route to get products into the NHS coupled with reformed incentive structures to drive innovation and faster regulatory approval for new technology and medicines. Drawing on the strength of our National Health Service, Labour will also maximise our potential to lead the world in clinical trials. This means making the process more efficient and accessible, by speeding up recruitment and giving more people a chance to participate through the NHS app. This will mean putting Britain at the forefront of transforming treatment for dementia. UK has a growing elderly population, and dementia pose an increasing societal and economic challenge in the country with an estimated currently close to 1 million people directly affected by the condition. Brain+' pipeline of innovative, therapeutic healthtech solutions for better dementia care builds on digital delivery of Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST). CST is the leading evidence-based non-pharmacological therapy for dementia. The method was in its original analogue form developed at the University College of London and CST is recommended by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). The UK has the highest CST use penetration of any country. CST utilizes engaging activities and exercises to stimulate cognitive function and improve quality of life for dementia patients. Brain+’ CST-Assistant provides high quality, validated, curated and flexible CST content and functionalities to deliver CST in a user-friendly and scalable format. Next generation product versions and other products in the company’s pipeline are intended to offer support for virtual delivery of CST to save further costs and lower the barriers to access as well as to provide for CST therapy to be conducted in a home setting. Beyond treatment, Brain+’ healthtech solutions offer valuable data collection capabilities. The platform can track patient progress, allowing healthcare professionals to personalize treatment plans and measure the effectiveness of interventions. This data-driven approach aligns with the Labour Party's drive for evidence-based care. Brain+'s is on track for planned UK market entry of the CST-Assistant by end Q3 2024. The Labour Party's strong commitment to reform and strengthen the NHS for the future and set better dementia management high on the political agenda, is foreseen to establish an even more receptive market for the company’s innovative dementia management solutions.
