    "text": "Assoc.Prof.Dr Neak Chandarith, Director of the Institute for International Studies and Public Policy under the Royal University of Phnom Penh (RUPP), told the Vietnam News Agency that Lam’s visits to Laos and Cambodia, his first overseas trips since he took office, demonstrate Vietnam’s strategic priority of developing ties with the neighbouring countries in its foreign policy. The Cambodia visit will create a chance for the leader to engage in discussions at the highest level, contributing to enhancing the Vietnam – Cambodia relations and cooperation across various domains, he said, adding both sides will exchange their views on and seek solutions to issues of mutual concerns. That the Vietnamese President will lay wreaths at the Independence Monument and the Cambodia – Vietnam Friendship Monument nearby affirms the country’s respect for its traditional and historical relations with Cambodia, the official said. He went on to say Lam’s visit also aims at bolstering the people-to-people exchanges and the people-to-people diplomacy, helping promote mutual understanding between the two peoples, stressing that Vietnam and Cambodia have worked to preserve their sound neightbourliness, comprehensive cooperation, and time-tested friendship over the past years. The Cambodian scholar said the two sides should maintain regular delegation exchanges at all levels and set up dialogue mechanisms to discuss priorities and share practical experience, while stepping up collaboration in such domains as economy, science, technology and innovation, education and training, climate change response, energy, environment, and health care.",
