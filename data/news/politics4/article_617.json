We will definitely fulfil every point—we have enough energy to do so.\"\nDetails : He also thanked NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg for all the years of cooperation: \"The Alliance has indeed become stronger.\"\nBackground :\nAdvertisement: During the NATO summit's opening, US President Joe Biden announced the delivery of five air defence systems, including a Patriot, to Ukraine.
