    "text": "The deputy governor of Ondo State, Dr Olayide Adelami, has applauded the Progressive Nation Women for Aiyedatiwa/Adelami 2024, for mobilising support for the All Progressives Congress (APC), ahead of the governorship election in the state. Receiving the women’s support group in his office, the deputy governor thanked the group for spreading the Aiyedatiwa/Adelami message across the nooks and crannies of the state, a statement by his media aide, John Paul Akinduro, said. He said, “I want to commend your team for deeming it fit to have a support group that is driven by women, which is producing outstanding results for our project. We are really encouraged by your efforts.” The group was led to the Governor’s office by the Special Assistant to the Governor on Women Mobilization, Mrs Bayo Aina and the Director General, Mrs Oluwatoyin Obalemo. In her introductory remarks, Aina said “members of the group are refered to as ‘Ambassadors’ and they are women from diverse backgrounds” She stated that the group has members in the 203 wards of the state, and has designed various programmes to further canvass and mobilize people to vote for the APC in the November 16 governorship election. Aina hinted that the group will, this Saturday, hold an event that would bring together women in politics from within and outside the state.",
