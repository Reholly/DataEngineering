    "text": "Update 7 a.m. ET 7/12: $500 so far. Thank you all for your support! (Changed the title from Tomorrow to Today.) Thousands of Michiganders and I will be cheering for Joe Biden tomorrow afternoon in Detroit. I’ll be leaving home at about 2 p.m. ET. (Deadline for ticket requests was Wednesday morning.) Please donate to re-elect Joe Biden! This link goes to the ActBlue page created by our little Daily Kos group (the Good News group). But please feel free to use whatever ActBlue donations page you prefer. However, if you donate on this ActBlue page, we’ll be able to track our progress. I won’t be available tonight, but I plan to return in the morning. Look, I know how generous Democrats are. Please do not give away your grocery money, etc. We got this. It’s perfectly okay to let others do the heaving and pulling tonight, okay? Recs, comments, replies: These are all I ask for. If you choose to comment that you donated, that would be great, but it’s not necessary. 132 Boosting Biden diaries are here. If you plan to attend the Joe Biden event tomorrow in Detroit, please let me know by comment or kosmail. We could meet there. (Starting balance $55.6K)",
