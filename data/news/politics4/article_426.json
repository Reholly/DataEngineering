The County Board on Thursday approved a grant agreement for the funding, which is part of the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant program. The program is meant to support units of local government in their development of strategies to [reduce energy use](https://pantagraph.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/new-illinois-state-energy-project-standards-welcomed-by-some-resisted-by-others/article_936c9518-a96e-11ed-bb60-a70a4975919d.html) and fossil fuel emissions.

Based on the results of a 2023 energy audit, the county determined several other energy efficiency upgrades at the health department that would meet the program's funding and timeline requirements, including a decentralized domestic hot water system. The other half will be used by the Ecology Action Center in Normal to finalize a study on the best management of the county's future energy use. \"They have a bunch of different programs going on but there's a main program right now where they're doing a big research study to see how we can best do that in the county,\" Soeldner said. According to the grant agreement, the energy plan and building upgrades must be completed by June 30, 2026. The county has taken several other steps to reduce its energy emissions.
