    "text": "In a significant move aimed at empowering Ex-Agniveers, the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) and Border Security Force (BSF) have announced special recruitment benefits for them. CISF Director General, Neena Singh stated that the CISF has made all arrangements to recruit Ex-Agniveers. \"CISF has made all arrangements to recruit Ex-Agniveers. Ten per cent of constable posts have been reserved for them and they will also be given relaxation in the Physical Efficiency Test,\" CISF Director General, Neena Singh said. \"There is also relaxation in age, there is a five-year relaxation in age for the first batch and three years of age relaxation afterwards,\" she remarked. \"Recruitment of Ex-Agniveers will benefit CISF as it will get the capable, dedicated and disciplined workforce, which will further enhance the efficiency of its operations, while Ex-Agniveers will also get the opportunity to serve in CISF,\" Neena Singh said. Echoing similar sentiments, BSF Director General Nitin Agrawal expressed enthusiasm for the upcoming recruitments. \"Ex-Agniveers have dedicated four years of their life in service. They are trained, and disciplined, and BSF, after giving short training, will deploy them along the borders. We are eagerly waiting to recruit them,\" he said. BSF DG Agarwal Agrawal confirmed the 10 per cent reservation for Ex-Agniveers in the recruitment process, along with age relaxations. \"For the first batch, the age relaxation is five years, while for subsequent batches, the age relaxation is three years,\" he explained. The statement comes following a recent controversy in the lower house of the parliament over Agniveer. Leader of Opposition and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday accused Defence Minister Rajnath Singh of \"lying\" on the floor of the Parliament over the Agniveer scheme and demanded an apology from the latter. In his video message on X, Rahul Gandhi said that Singh had lied in Parliament about the issue of compensation to families of killed Agniveers. \"The importance of truth in every religion. Rajnath Singh lied before Lord Shiva's photo about the compensation to the country, its armed forces, and Agniveers. I have said in my speech that don't listen to me or his (Rajnath Singh) speech, but listen to the family of Agniveer family,\" the Leader of the Opposition said in a video message. He shared the video of the father of Agniveer Ajay Singh who died in Jammu and Kashmir and said that despite Singh's claims, his family had not received the promised compensation. However, issuing a clarification, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said that the \"Indian Army is committed to the welfare of Agniveers!\" (ANI)",
