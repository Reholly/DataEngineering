According to an Ukrinform correspondent, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said this during a press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky after their meeting in Washington on Thursday.\nHe said there was no doubt that Ukraine has the right to use the weapons it has - of its own production and weapons provided by allies - to strike legitimate military targets on Russian territory.\nAccording to Stoltenberg, it is important to remember that this is a war of aggression launched by Russia against its democratic friendly neighbor - Ukraine.\n\"Russia invaded Ukraine. That's a blatant violation of international law, and according to international law, Ukraine, of course, has the right to self-defense. NATO allies have the right to help and uphold Ukraine's right to self-defense without becoming a party to the conflict. And the right of self-defense includes also the right to strike legitimate military targets on the territory of the aggressor - Russia,\" he said.\nIn this regard, he welcomed the fact that some allies reduced and some others did not impose restrictions on the use of weapons provided by Ukraine, and \"this has enabled Ukraine to strike legitimate military targets on the territory of Russia.\"\nTop news Australia announces largest military aid package for Ukraine Zelensky meets with ErdoÄŸan in Washington Sullivan: U.S. not allow Ukraine to strike Russia with ATACMS missiles Pentagon: New aid package for Ukraine includes Patriot battery, munitions for HIMARS More news Top news Kryvyi Rih struck with eight Russian missiles: Hydraulic structures damaged",
