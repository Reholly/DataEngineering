    "text": "Pune: The upcoming Union Budget for 2024-25 will likely focus on job creation and the govt is expected to provide initiatives to stimulate work opportunities, veteran banker and current chairperson and CEO of Salesforce India, Arundhati Bhattacharya said. “I think the govt is looking at jobs from whatever the poll outcome has been and the experts have been saying,” she said on the sidelines of a press conference organised by the US-based SaaS firm. Bhattacharya stressed the need for developing sectors that are labour intensive areas so that the govt can upskill the workforce and create the infrastructure in those areas. There are lots of areas that the govt can focus on ranging from tourism, health to life sciences, she added. Infrastructure-heavy sectors such as housing and roadways contribute significantly to the economy in addition to job creation. The housing sales continue to witness record growth across all major metros in the post pandemic period, however, growth in the affordable segment is lagging. On the regulation of in the fintech sector in India, Bhattacharya said that in order to become sustainable, there should be self-regulation or regulation imposed by regulators. Earlier, micro loans were introduced was self-regulated but people were driven by death traps and then regulators had to step in. “Basically, what we are looking at is assessment of risks. If you are able to do that you will not get in trouble with the regulators,” she added.We also published the following articles recentlyEU regulator has a warning for Nvidia: We have beenLearn about the European Union's scrutiny of tech giant Nvidia for potential market risks related to AI chip supply.
