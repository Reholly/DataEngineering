    "text": "Top O' the Briefing Happy Friday, dear Kruiser Morning Briefing friends. Unbenthwys would occasionally stir a little Robitussin into his morning chocotini when he was feeling nostalgic for his madcap days in community theater.\nAdvertisement In a continuing effort to put lipstick on a public relations disaster pig, Joe Biden's handlers keep trotting him out in front of television cameras for chances to \"prove\" himself. Most Americans are in agreement that it's a little late in the game for that, but the kids on Team Joe are a plucky and determined lot.\nOr desperate.\nBiden's much-hyped press conference last night was supposed to assuage any fears Democrats might have about his ability to carry on as their nominee. Let's be honest, we're not really talking about his readiness for a second term, just whether he can make it through until Election Day.\nThe most charitable thing I can say about it is that there wasn't much in the way of assuagement.\nYou can check out the reactions of the PJ Media crew here at the liveblog we had going during the press conference. Matt then wrote a wrap-up of the presser, and here was his assessment :\nMake no mistake about it: this was not a great press conference, but it was better than his performance at the debate and his interview with George Stephanopoulos. And that's a problem for the Democrats. From the perspective of Biden's campaign, that's good enough for him to stay in the race.\nAs we have discussed many times in recent days, Biden and his missus aren't in sync with most of the people in their party. The more of them who call for Biden to leave the race, the more the Bidens dig in. There were a few more defections after the press conference, but the media reaction was telling.\nYes, the propagandists acknowledged his verbal blunders but didn't dwell on them. The Washington Post homepage said, \"Biden shows foreign policy depth in news conference with a few stumbles.\"\nAdvertisement The New York Times ‚Äî which has been quite critical of Biden since the debate ‚Äî merely offered up a benign headline with Biden's vow to \"finish the job.\"\nThe Times and WaPo weren't exactly back in pre-debate cheerleader mode, but there was a subtle shift away from the harsh tones both have been taking. I've been telling people all week that we would start to see this as soon as the realization that Biden's not going anywhere began to sink in. Celebrities and elected officials can continue to call for Biden to yield to another candidate, but the flying monkeys in the mainstream media will eventually have to get back to covering for the work of fiction that they created in 2020.\nDemocrats on Capitol Hill will eventually have to fall back in line, too. This is from The New York Times post-presser report :\n‚ÄúI think Biden was presidential. He hit his accomplishments really well, showed a substantive mastery of foreign policy, for an hour, and a determination to finish the job,‚Äù Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat of Delaware and one of Biden‚Äôs closest allies on Capitol Hill, tells me. ‚ÄúHonestly, could the other guy have done any of that? Anyone concerned about his ability to lead and govern should be reassured.‚Äù\nReiterating: there was nothing reassuring about Biden's slur-fest.\nDemocrats will soon have to start whipping up huge batches of Kool-Aid. They've been drinking it for four years now, so it won't be tough to get back into the habit after a short break.\nThe mainstream media's brief moment of clarity will most likely soon end. We will keep pushing back on every false narrative they throw at us.

Subscribe\nThe Mailbag of Magnificence contributions can be sent to [email protected] .\nThe Mailbag of Magnificence We have a few quick ones this week. Let's begin with this one from Alex:\nI can‚Äôt draw, but picture this for a cartoon: an angry Joe Man Orange standing outside the White House with the caption, ‚ÄúGet off my lawn!‚Äù\nI wish I had some drawing skills, too ‚Äî I'd be having a field day right now. I would do the above cartoon with him yelling at Secret Service agents because he doesn't know why they're there.\nAgain, this isn't something I would mock in a private citizen, but this senile idiot is urinating all over the Constitution.\nMark New Mexico writes:\nInteresting that they are pulling the ‚ÄòHe was always supposed to be a one-termer‚Äô excuse from their nether regions, when the big dog donors coulda been raising the issue much earlier. Great day to be here in the forest highlands east of ABQ ‚Äì Temps in the low 60‚Äôs, with a ‚Äòbackdoor‚Äô ( comin‚Äô from the east ) cold front on the way. You get to brag about TUC weather in the winter; we‚Äôll be there for a few weeks then in any case ;-}\nI would wager that an implicit agreement was in place, then DOCTOR Mama Jill backed out of it last year. The money people were caught off guard, but at the time, probably figured that the various lawfare assaults on Trump would keep him from the nomination and they ballot. They knew that pressing forward with Biden wasn't ideal, but felt safe because of their hijacking of the justice system.\nAdvertisement As for the weather, it's 109 here in the cooler part of the Sonoran Desert this Thursday afternoon. Let's just say I'm not hiking a lot right now.\nDemocrat TDS is also self-defeating. Trumps support is half the country giving the middle finger to the other half. The more that other half engages in TDS, the higher that middle finger goes up.\nAnd let us hope that more voters who are on the fence want to join us in the one-fingered salute.\nWe will finish with this from Dale:\nRepublicans have this uncanny talent for snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. I‚Äôm with you - I‚Äôll celebrate only when the moving vans tote Mama Jill and the rest of the miscreants back to Delaware.\nYeah, I'm still smarting from getting way out over my skis in 2022, and I don't even ski. Trump could be leading by eight in every swing state, but I still wouldn't be comfortable. Fingers crossed for the moving vans!\nIt's good to be back.
