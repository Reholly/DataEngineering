    "text": "Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott is joining Democratic mayors across the country to show support for President Joe Biden.\n“I fortunately get to be with the president probably more than most mayors and I have not been concerned,” Scott said during a press conference on Wednesday. “I am concerned that we are not having a conversation that we should be having. His opponent is a convicted felon. His opponent wants to take away further take away women’s rights. His opponent… wants to be a dictator. His opponent won’t acknowledge the results of an election. His opponent wants to turn back this country into the 1960s or before. That’s what we should be talking about here.”\nMaryland Rep. Kweisi Mfume also issued support for Biden.\n“I can tell you that the president was clear, concise, coherent, consistent and committed to the programs, policies and principles that have guided this nation over the last four years,”\nMfume told WBAL NewsRadio’s Robert Lang.\nBiden is scheduled to take questions from reporters late this afternoon in a news conference at the D.C. convention center after the nato summit concludes there.\n“This gentleman (Trump), and I use that term lightly, that the president is running against shouldn’t be allowed anywhere near the White House,” Scott said.\nIn his conversation with C4 and Bryan Nehman on Thursday, Scott dismissed a new poll from ABC News and the Washington Post.\nThe poll said that among Democrats, 62% believe Biden needs to drop out of the race.\nScott cited his own experiences leading up to the Democratic primary against Sheila Dixon. Scott said he has no concerns with the president’s capabilities and insisted the focus should be on former president Trump.",
