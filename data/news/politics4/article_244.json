    "text": "Advocacy in Canberra Last week, Mayor Cr Clare Le Serve, Deputy Mayor Cr Rochelle Halstead, and CEO Greg Box attended a series of pivotal meetings with Federal Ministers, Shadow Ministers, and representatives in Canberra as part of our advocacy program and key regional priorities. During these meetings, we emphasised the significance of advocacy and our vital role in representing Bass Coast, presenting the highest priorities for you, our community. This week provided a fantastic opportunity to foster relationships across government to advance critical advocacy issues for Bass Coast. Key topics included the importance of eco-tourism in our area, the Bass Coast Dinosaur Trail, our tracks and trails, regional development, transport, and the freight needs essential for enhancing both existing and future infrastructure. We also addressed further tourism opportunities, the impacts of coastal erosion in our region, and issues concerning affordable housing, social housing, and short-stay accommodation. Additionally, we had the fortuitous timing to meet with peers from other councils and local government associations, where we exchanged insights on financial sustainability and current pressures on local government. This series of meetings provided a valuable opportunity for Bass Coast to highlight key community priorities to parliamentary members, engage with peers, and share common themes and perspectives. We remain committed to advocating strongly for our region so we can build and grow together. The delegation met with a range of people including the following representatives: The Hon Jonathon Duniam, Shadow Minister for Environment and Water The Hon [Julie Collins,](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julie-collins-2b1b5091/) Minister Housing and Homelessness' The Hon [Michael Sukkar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelsukkarmp/) MP, Shadow Minister for Housing and Homelessness The Hon Kevin Hogan MP, Shadow Minister for Trade and Tourism The Hon Catherine King MP, Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government The Hon Darren Chester, Shadow Minister for Local Government and Regional Development The Hon Kristy McBain MP, Minister for Regional Development, Local Government and Territories Local member for Monash, Russell Broadbent MP Senator David Van Office of The Hon [Ted O'Brien MP](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tedobrienmp/), Shadow Minister for Climate Change [here](/important-advocacy-efforts-in-canberra-1274181/).",
