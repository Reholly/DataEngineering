    "text": "Federal Minister for Industries, Production, and National Food Security, Rana Tanveer Hussain, on Thursday reiterated the government’s commitment to promoting the cotton industry. He made this statement while addressing the meeting of the Pakistan Central Cotton Committee (PCCC)’s governing body, according to a news release.\nThe minister stressed that Pakistan’s economy heavily relies on cotton production and that the growth of the textile industry is linked to good cotton yields.\n“The textile industry has been granted a Rs10 per unit subsidy on electricity, which will significantly alleviate its financial burdens and difficulties to a great extent,” he added.\nHe pointed out that research and development must be prioritised, and that the government is committed to providing comprehensive support to farmers, ginners, and all relevant stakeholders.\nThe minister noted that the country’s annual cotton production currently stands at 8.4 million bales, with an aim to increase to 15 million bales by 2025. The yield per acre can be increased with modern agricultural practices and technology.\nIn light of the Food and Agriculture Organisation report, recommendations are sought for the restructuring of PCCC. The next meeting will be held next week.\nCOMMENTS\nComments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.\nFor more information, please see our\n[Comments FAQ](/comments-policy)",
