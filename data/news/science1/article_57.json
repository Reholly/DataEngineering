    "text": "Posted in: [Netflix](/tv/netflix/), [Preview](/tv/preview-tv/), [streaming](/tv/streaming/), [TV](/tv/) | Tagged: [cobra kai](/tag/cobra-kai/), [netflix](/tag/netflix/), [preview](/tag/preview-2/), [Season 6](/tag/season-6/) Cobra Kai Co-Creator Schlossberg Confirms Longer Series Finale & More Cobra Kai co-creator Hayden Schlossberg answered fans' questions about the sixth & final season on social media - here are the highlights. Article Summary - Cobra Kai S6 eyed for 2024 release, may have lengthier finale. - Schlossberg teases Terry Silver's students might join Miyagi-Fang. - Eager fans can expect a new dojo name reveal in Season 6 opener. - Promised 'biggest, baddest' season. Creators highlight show's end. When we last checked in on how things were looking with the sixth & final season of Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz, and Hayden Schlossberg's Ralph Macchio & William Zabka-starring Cobra Kai, Hurwitz [offered an update](https://bleedingcool.com/tv/cobra-kai-creators-season-6-filming-update-decision-to-end-series/) on filming (expected to begin shortly after the start of the new year) while Heald explained how they knew now was the right time to bring the series to an end. First this go-around, we're taking a look at the spoiler-free answers that Schlossberg offered on Twitter/X regarding the \"Karate Kid\" spinoff's final run. Here's a look at the highlights: First up, Schlossberg says the goal is to film in 2024 and have the 10-episode final season hit screens by the end of the year and that they're eyeing a longer series finale episode (with the season also having a longer overall runtime). There's a \"good chance\" that the remaining students from Terry Silver's (Thomas Ian Griffith) Cobra Kai will join Miyagi-Fang. The Sekai Taikai will require a team leader from each dojo, and we will learn the name of the new dojo during the Season 6 opener. As for the questions regarding who would get the most focus during the final seasons, Schlossberg drove home the point that \"everyone gets their moment in the spotlight\" and that we \"will learn more about everyone's past, present, and future.\" Cobra Kai Creators Address Season 6 & Franchise's Future Promising the \"biggest\" and \"baddest\" season yet, the show's creators penned a letter to the show's supporters thanking them for their support and explaining the importance of ending Cobra Kai \"on our terms\" when the news was first announced earlier this year. Here's a look back at their letter: Ralph Macchio (Daniel LaRusso), William Zabka (Johnny Lawrence), Courtney Henggeler (Amanda LaRusso), Xolo Maridue√±a (Miguel Diaz), Tanner Buchanan (Robby Keene), Mary Mouser (Samantha LaRusso), Jacob Bertrand (Hawk), Gianni Decenzo (Demetri), Vanessa Rubio (Carmen), Peyton List (Tory), and Martin Kove (John Kreese) star, along with Dallas Dupree Young (Kenny), Oona O'Brien (Devon) and Thomas Ian Griffith (Terry Silver). Alicia Hannah-Kim (Minx) portrays South Korean sensei Kim Da-Eun, who plays a major role in Terry Silver's expansion plans. Dallas Dupree Young's Kenny Payne had been promoted to series regular for the fifth season. In addition, Sean Kanan is returned to the franchise to reprise his role as Mike Barnes. Cobra Kai is written and executive produced by series creators Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz, and Hayden Schlossberg via production company Counterbalance Entertainment. Will Smith, James Lassiter, and Caleeb Pinkett executive produce for Westbrook Entertainment along with Susan Ekins in association with Sony Pictures Television. Macchio and Zabka also serve as executive [producers.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWOA1ZGywLbqmigxE4Qlvuw) [ Stay up-to-date and support the site by following Bleeding Cool on Google News today! ](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMPHflgsw1IauAw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en)",
