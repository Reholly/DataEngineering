Conduct Proper Keyword Research\nProper keyword research is one of the most important SEO growth hacks to help boost your online visibility. It involves identifying the words and phrases your target audience uses to find your blog content, products, or services. There are many tools you can use for this, including\nAhrefs, Semrush, and more.\nIf you’re in a competitive niche, you’ll have better success at targeting long-tail keywords as they have lower\nkeyword difficulty.\nCheck out our list of\nrecommended keyword research tools here.\nBesides finding the right keywords, you should know how to use them strategically. A few ways include adding your focus keyword to your:\n- Headline\n- SEO title\n- Meta description\n- Introduction and conclusion\n- Headers (H1, H2, H3, etc.)\n- URL\nHowever, you should avoid keyword stuffing, which is the overuse of your keyword. Instead, opt for synonyms and other\nLSI keywords.\n3. Understand Search Intent\nBesides identifying the right keywords, you should also ensure you understand the search intent behind those keywords. Search intent refers to the main goal a user wants to achieve with the search query. The main 4 intent types include:\n- Informational: Refers to the searches made to get information about a product or service.\n- Navigational: People with this type of intent are looking for a specific website or webpage.\n- Transactional: Users with this intent search to buy something at that moment.\n- Commercial: This type refers to searches made to buy in the near future.\nWhile it may sound complicated, figuring out search intent is quite easy. Two of the best ways to do it include:\n- Use tools: keyword research tools like\nSemrushhave a search intent feature that helps highlight the most common user intent behind a keyword.\n- Study\nsearch engine results pages(SERPs): Study the SERPs and see the type of content that ranks well.\nIf you can figure out the intent behind your target audience’s searches, you can create tailored campaigns that have more impact.\n4. Focus on Content Optimization\nOne of the essential pieces of the SEO puzzle is content. You should create content that search engines can easily discover, crawl, and index. One way of doing this is by using AIOSEO’s\nTruSEO On-page Analysis.\nThe TruSEO On-page Analysis gives you a score of how well-optimized your content is. It even gives you recommendations for improving your it. Besides the TruSEO On-page Analysis, you can also use AIOSEO’s\nhttps://aioseo.com/announcing-truseo-highlighter/ to optimize your content on the go.\nThe TruSEO Highlighter analyzes your page content and makes readability recommendations. It also highlights items that need fixing.\nThis shows you various elements of your content including:\n- Subheading distribution\n- Passive voice\n- Transition words\nThe feature also gives you recommendations for fixing any on-page SEO errors it finds.\nOther tips for creating SEO-friendly content include:\n- Craft captivating headlines\n- Optimize your\nSEO titles and meta descriptions\n- Build\ninternal links\nOptimized content is one of the best ways to rank a new website, as it makes it easier for readers to share your content, resulting in a boost in relevant traffic. It also makes it easier to build relevant backlinks to your content. These signal to search engines that your content is valuable, leading to better search rankings.\nCheck out this case study on how a golfing blog grew its traffic by 190% YOY by optimizing its content.\n5. Create Topic Clusters\nTopic clusters are a group of relevant content pieces that comprehensively cover a subject from many angles and are interlinked. They help build topical authority and enhance your semantic SEO, both great ways of getting your site and content to rank in a competitive niche.\nCreating a topic cluster requires 2 main components:\nCornerstone Content (Pillar Page)\nYour\ncornerstone content is the hub of the topic cluster. This page covers the main subject in-depth, with each subheading briefly addressing related subtopics.\nYou can easily mark these using AIOSEO’s Cornerstone Content feature:\nMarking your post/page as cornerstone content also adds it to a new post list filter dedicated to cornerstone content.\nThis filter allows you to see your important pages at a glance, making it easier to create links to them.\nSubtopic Pages\nSubtopic pages are the pieces of content you create to provide in-depth coverage of a single aspect of the main subject and link to the pillar page.\nOnce you’ve built your pillar pages and subtopics, create strategic internal links between them. You can automate this by using AIOSEO’s\nLink Assistant module, where a building icon denotes the cornerstone content.\nClick the Add Link button to add links to your cornerstone content, and Link Assistant will work its magic in the background. You don’t even have to open the pages in editor mode!\nCreating topic clusters has never been as easy as it is with AIOSEO’s Cornerstone Content.\n6. Aim for the Featured Snippet\nAnother SEO growth hack to employ is aiming for the featured image. A featured snippet is a special type of search result displayed at the top of Google’s search engine results page (SERP) that aims to provide users with a direct and concise answer to their query.\nA few ways to land the featured snippet include:\n- Implementing schema markup\n- Using a table of contents\n- Adding FAQs to your content\n- Optimizing your content\n- Creating the best piece of content on the topic\nFeatured snippets are often called “position zero” because they appear above the standard organic search results.\nFor tips on optimizing for this coveted piece of real estate on SERPs, check out our tutorial on\ngetting the featured snippet. You can also check out how a food blog grew its traffic from 77K to 1 million in just 2 months. Part of their strategy was optimizing for the featured snippets.\n7. Target Google’s People Also Ask (PAA) Section\nGoogle’s People Also Ask (PAA) refers to related questions searchers may have about your particular topic.\nThe PAA section of Google’s SERPs is a prominent feature that gives publishers an opportunity to bolster their visibility on search engines further.\nOptimizing for the PAA section also helps you bolster your semantic SEO strategy. This is because answering the common questions users ask in relation to your primary keyword helps you create content with semantic depth. It also helps you capture traffic for long-tail keywords.\nYou can check out our guide to\noptimizing for Google’s people also ask section for step-by-step instructions. Here’s a case study of how a food blog optimized its content for the PAA section and grew traffic by 508% in 3 months.\n8. Build Strategic Links\nAnother popular SEO growth hack is link building. However, for it to be impactful, you must do it right. The 3 types of links you should focus on are:\nInternal links\nThese are links between pages on your website. They have many SEO benefits, including distributing link juice across your pages, improving crawling and indexing, enhancing user experience, and more.\nBuilding\nstrategic internal links is a breeze with AIOSEO’s Link Assistant. You don’t have to manually add them. Link Assistant is an AI-powered tool that crawls your site and gives a report of all the links on your site.\nIt also gives you a Links Report that shows you internal linking suggestions and the\norphan pages on your site.\nThe report also shows you all the internal links to and from a post, affiliate links on a post, and all external links. Most importantly, it gives you internal linking suggestions.\nThe best part is that you don’t even need to open a post to add the links. You can just do so from the Link Assistant dashboard.\nBacklinks\nBacklinks are links from external sites to your site. They are important because they serve as a vote of confidence that your site is reliable and the content valuable. A few ways of building backlinks include:\n- Guest posting\n- Listing on business directories\n- Running outreach campaigns\nCheck out our link building guide for tips on building backlinks and external links. You can also check out this case study of how Explore.com quadrupled its traffic in 10 months. One of their growth tactics was obtaining high-quality backlinks.\n9. Find and Fix Broken Links\nBroken links are bad for SEO as they result in crawl errors and a negative user experience. This can result in poor SEO performance and higher bounce rates.\nThat’s why you should regularly monitor your site for broken links and fix them. This can be easily done with AIOSEO’s\nBroken Link Checker, a tool that crawls your site to find broken links.\nThis powerful tool does more than find broken links. It also offers you solutions for fixing them.\nBecause Broken Link Checker automatically checks your site for broken links, you reduce the occurrence of crawl errors.\nCheck out our guide on\nfinding and fixing broken links for detailed instructions on eliminating broken links on your site.\n10. Watch Out For Content Decay\nContent decay is the gradual decrease in organic performance for content designed specifically for SEO. It’s called content decay because the decline in performance is gradual rather than a sharp drop-off.\nContent decay is a silent killer of your SEO efforts and should be curbed as soon as possible.\nThankfully, spotting content decay is super easy with AIOSEO’s\nSearch Statistics feature, which shows you Google Search Console (GSC) data right inside your WordPress dashboard. And one of the insights it gives is a Content Performance report.\nFrom the Content Performance report, you can see the Top Losing content. The Diff tab shows a proprietary point system that shows the rate at which your content is decaying.\nFor more information, check out our tutorial on\nspotting and combatting content decay.\n11. Use AI to Create Your Meta Data\nMetadata, like your SEO title tags and meta descriptions, are important elements of SEO. This is because they’re the first elements of your content that users interact with on SERPs. A few tips for optimizing your SEO title tags and meta descriptions include:\n- Your keyword\n- The name of the product/service\n- A user-focused, search intent-driven description\nHaving all this information in your SEO title tags and meta descriptions will help users know if your content is what they’re looking for. It will also help your pages rank well on search engines.\nFortunately, you can use AI for this mundane task. You can automatically generate SEO titles and meta descriptions using AIOSEO’s\nAI Title/Description Generator.\nThe AI-powered tool generates SEO title tags and meta descriptions from your content and gives you 5 suggestions.\nAnd it does all this at the single click of a button. The best part is the meta data is SEO-friendly!\nFor detailed instructions on using this powerful feature, check out our guide on\ngenerating meta descriptions using AI.\n12. Optimize for Local SEO (Optional)\nIf you’re a local business that relies on foot traffic, then one of the most important SEO growth hacks for you is optimizing for local SEO.\nLocal SEO refers to the strategies a business uses to improve its online visibility to reach a location-specific audience. For instance, if you run a brick-and-mortar store or offer local services like plumbing, you can use your website to reach a local audience. A few tips for getting your local SEO right include:\n- Getting your local on-page SEO right\n- Listing on business directories\n- Building and optimizing local citations\nYou can also use AIOSEO’s\nLocal Business SEO module to increase your visibility for local searches and on Google Maps. This is a great way to rank high for local searches, including voice searches.\nNeed detailed steps for boosting your local SEO?\nThen check out our\nlocal SEO checklist.\n13. Pay Attention to Site Security\nWebsite security is one of the SEO growth hacks that don’t get the attention they deserve.\nSecurity is a key ranking factor as search engines want to ensure the websites they recommend are secure and protect users’ privacy.\nAnd that’s why implementing SSL/HTTPS on your site is strongly recommended. Once you install an SSL certificate on your site, a padlock sign will appear in the address bar. This shows your visitors that they’re on a secure page.\nIn addition, your website address will begin with HTTPS instead of just HTTP. These visual queues are a great way to gain user trust, an important factor in encouraging repeat visitors.\nCheck out our article on\nHTTPS and SEO for more details on the impact site security has on your search rankings.\n14. Measure, Analyse, and Refine\nOne mistake many marketers and small business owners make with SEO is neglecting to measure results.\nMonitoring your SEO performance is one of the SEO growth hacks you should prioritize.\nYou need to monitor and measure your performance based on the goals and KPIs you’ve set for your SEO campaigns.\nThere are many SEO monitoring tools you can use for this. However, if you’re a WordPress user, AIOSEO’s Search Statistics makes everything easier. For example, you can use AIOSEO’s Search Statistics to monitor your important metrics like clicks, average CTR, search impressions, search position and more.\nMeasuring your SEO performance in WordPress couldn’t be easier.\nIf the data in the reports shows that you’re not quite hitting your\nSEO goals, you can use it to figure out how to adjust your campaigns so they perform better.\nSEO Growth Hacks: Your FAQs Answered\nWhat are SEO Growth Hacks?\nSEO growth hacks are strategic and innovative techniques to enhance a website’s search engine ranking and outperform competitors.
