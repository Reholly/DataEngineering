    "text": "Zippy, zingy garlic – it’s a beloved aromatic staple in so many kitchens!\nFresh garlic is commonly sold as whole bulbs, which you can buy individually or in multipacks. Each bulb consists of singular cloves enclosed in a white, paper-like skin that must be removed before consumption.\nWhen raw, the taste of garlic is robust, the texture is crunchy, and the antioxidant health benefits are aplenty!\nAfter it is cooked, even for a few seconds sauteed in a skillet, the harsher flavors mellow, inviting its signature taste and scent to subtly mingle with any ingredients cooked with it.\nWe link to vendors to help you find relevant products. If you buy from one of our links,\nwe may earn a commission.\nAnd when cooked for longer periods of time, the cloves can be creamy enough to be spread on top of a piece of crusty bread, like butter!\nTo infuse the strongest, most pronounced taste and aroma into your dishes, you need to finely mince the cloves or crush them in order to release as many volatile compounds as possible.\nWithout a mechanical tool, the most efficient option to prep this perfectly pungent ingredient is with a knife. Even though that method works well, there’s are a few annoyances:\nFirst, your prep time slows down with the motion of crushing, dicing, mincing, or chopping individual cloves entirely by hand.\nAnd, perhaps even worse than increased time spent in the kitchen, your fingers are coated in the garlic’s released excretions, covering you with its strong scent that can’t easily be removed!\nAnd pre-minced garlic, like what you find in jars, often includes additives and stabilizers to maintain a longer shelf life – ingredients that lower the taste and aroma qualities of the fresh product.\nA garlic press has the ability to crush whole, fresh cloves through small perforations into a soft paste quickly, cleanly, and efficiently. This definitely speeds up your prep time without settling for a pre-minced food product.\nIn this guide, we’ll review all of our favorite models, and break down the differences of materials this tool is commonly made out of, so you can get make the most informed purchasing decision.\nGrab the mints, and let’s go shopping!\nThe Best Garlic Presses\n[Alpha Grillers](#Alpha-Grillers) [Joseph Joseph CleanForce 20179](#Joseph-Joseph-CleanForce-20179) [Mannkitchen](#Mannkitchen) [Orblue Premium AK005](#Orblue-Premium-AK005) [OXO Good Grips 11327300](#OXO-Good-Grips-11327300) [Rösle 12895](#Rosle-12895) [Zyliss Susi 3](#Zyliss-Susi-3)\nFoodal’s Top 7 Choices\n1.

The coating on these models may peel or darken with extended use.\nPlastic\nPlastic models are made to be durable, but they will not have as long of a lifespan as their metal counterparts.\nThese less expensive devices feature colorful and innovative designs with modern touches, an aesthetic update from the more classic, utilitarian appearances of metal models.\nOften combined with other materials, plastic is typically used for the handles and the body’s shell. Usually, the mechanics and perforated basket will be made out of a metal material, like stainless steel.\nFor the price difference, plastic presses work quickly and efficiently. They are best suited for occasional use, or for use as a secondary press.\nStainless Steel\nIf this will be a tool you are going to utilize on a daily basis, you should seriously consider purchasing a stainless steel model, one that is durable and resistant to corrosion and rust with repeat use and cleanings.\nThese models are on the higher-quality end of the materials spectrum, often coming with a pricier cost.\nSince quality stainless steel is rust resistant, you can be assured that these gadgets will stand the test of time.\nAfter washing, either by hand or in the dishwasher, develop the good practice of drying by hand to ensure all residue is removed.\nSwift Prep with a Cool Tool\nThe ultimate goal of a press is to\n[prep fresh cloves](/tag/Garlic/) in order to extract perfectly pungent compounds, and to create a fine paste that can easily be mixed into whatever you’re cooking…\nWithout leaving a strongly aromatic residue on your fingers!\nThe device’s ability to cleanly mince more than one whole clove with the skin still on is an impressive kitchen task, as this helps speed along the process of food preparation.\nTake your cooking style and needs into consideration when selecting the press that is best suited for your needs! A stainless steel model is more appropriate for frequent use, whereas a less expensive plastic version will achieve similar results when utilized only occasionally.\nDo you have a model in mind for your household?
