    "text": "Moto Guzzi’s Custom ‘Levante’ Motorcycle: A Masterpiece of Design and Performance\nSummary: The Moto Guzzi custom motorcycle, Levante, is the latest creation by celebrated customizer Filippo Barbacane of Officine Rossopuro. This project, using a former police NTX 350 as a donor bike, reflects Barbacane’s personal vision unrestricted by client demands. With extensive modifications including an engine swap, custom bodywork, and an array of performance upgrades, the Levante is both a statement of craftsmanship and a prepared adventurer for travels to destinations like Iceland and Morocco.\nFilippo Barbacane, the celebrated visionary behind Officine Rossopuro based in Pescara, Italy, has once again demonstrated his expertise in motorcycle customization through the creation of ‘Levante’. This Moto Guzzi-based project reflects Filippo’s profound craft without the typical constraints of commissioned work. The Levante emerged from the shell of a mid-1980s ex-police NTX 350 motorcycle, repurposed for off-road and overland exploration.\nIn order to imbue the vintage police bike with a new lease of life, the original engine was replaced with a modern 750cc Moto Guzzi heart, capable of delivering low-end torque essential for the trail. The accompanying modifications saw a dive into high-quality fabrication; the motorcycle dons a freshly crafted aluminum body paint with a unique gas tank secured by leather straps, and a scrambler-style bench seat finished in black leather for enhanced comfort during rigorous off-road journeys.\nThe Levante didn’t only receive cosmetic enhancements; performance was a key focus. The engine upgrade was complemented by an in-house designed stainless-steel exhaust system, and the suspension was revamped with Bitubo shocks providing adjustable resilience for varied terrain. Safety and handling were addressed by integrating a sophisticated Brembo braking system, and the wheels were outfitted with Continental TKC 80 tires suitable for both tarmac and trails.\nIn an ode to the bike’s custom nature, the aluminum body was left unpainted to showcase the craftsmanship, while the frame was contrasted in red, bringing a visual pop to the overall aesthetic. Barbacane’s meticulous attention to detail can be seen in the functional and stylish accents such as handmade fender and tank bags, though he outvoted the use of LED lighting in favor of maintaining a classic look. The Levante stands as a testament to Barbacane’s skill and passion, ready to carve paths in both the urban jungle and the rugged backcountry.\nFAQ Section\n1.
