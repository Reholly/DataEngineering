    "text": "This morning (29th), the Shanghai Bureau of China Railway announced that the annual number of passengers sent by the Yangtze River Delta Railway in 2023 will exceed 8 million, an increase of more than one percent compared with the annual number of passengers sent in 2019, a record high. At present, the Yangtze River Delta Railway has an operating mileage of more than 14000,25 kilometers, including 7100 high-speed rail lines and more than , kilometers of high-speed railway mileage. In addition to the island of Zhoushan, Zhejiang, the scope of EMU operation has covered all prefecture-level cities in the Yangtze River Delta, becoming one of the most developed areas of the high-speed rail network in China. Since the beginning of this year, the Yangtze River Delta Railway has been guided by market demand, optimized the train operation map three times, continuously improved the layout of the road network through deep excavation of transportation capacity configuration, and realized the bus-based operation of high-speed rail. The Yangtze River Delta Railway also actively explores the intelligent passenger service model of \"dual network integration\" of high-speed rail network and Internet, and has successively applied advanced technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence, mobile Internet, and face recognition to passenger services, so that passengers can travel more smoothly and calmly through service innovation. This year marks the fifth anniversary of the integrated development of the Yangtze River Delta as a national strategy, and most cities in the Yangtze River Delta have achieved 1, 2 and 3 hours of railway travel. The railway department also combed the passenger flow and attendance data of the center and sub-center cities of the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration such as Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Hefei, analyzed the rules, increased the daily morning peak and weekend evening peak driving density, helped the life of the two cities, pulled out the \"same city effect\", and accelerated the \"Yangtze River Delta on the track\".
