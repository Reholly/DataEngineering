    "text": "Calling all “Big Hero 6” fans! On a scale of 1 to 10, you’re might want to rate these new Baymax and Mochi items a solid 10. Baymax and Mochi Loungefly Mini Backpack – $88 Baymax cuddles up with his favorite hairy baby, Mochi, in this all-white Loungefly mini backpack we found inside Star Traders at Magic Kingdom. The left side has a slide pocket. On the right side, there is a Disney Parks x Loungefly metal plate on the slip pocket. The shoulder straps are padded and adjustable. There is a top carry strap. On the bottom right corner, there is a screen print of Baymax standing with Mochi resting on his head. Baymax’s hands are connected via two snaps that you can pop open to reveal more of Mochi beneath him, or snap closed to have Baymax give Mochi a hug. There are also two snaps that keep Baymax’s head secure to the top of the backpack. The interior of the backpack is the signature “Big Hero 6” red. It is covered in an allover print of Baymax and Mochi in different poses. Baymax and Mochi Ear Headband – $34.99 Onto World of Disney in Disney Springs, where we found these “Big Hero 6” ears perfect for those who love Baymax and Mochi equally. The left ear is made entirely of Baymax’s face, with his eyes embroidered on. The center of the headband is small Mochi plush giving a perfectly-content — and possible mischievous — grin. The right ear is more of Baymax with two bandages to prevent him from deflating. From the back of the headband, you can see the back side of Mochi. The band has a red-orange non-slip velour interior. Baymax and Mochi Long-Sleeved Shirt – $44.99 You can complete the look with this long-sleeved shirt we also found at World of Disney. Mochi sits on top of Baymax’s head in a sketch style design. Beneath them in black lettering reads, “My caregiving matrix is not equipped to deal with this problem.” What do you think about this new additional Baymax and Mochi representation in Walt Disney World? Will you be picking up any of these new items? Let us know in the comments below.
