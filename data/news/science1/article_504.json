    "text": "INDIANAPOLIS â€” Help is coming to Indiana parents who are having a hard time paying for childcare. The state is giving out $18.1 million in grant money to businesses to help their workers secure care for their children. Gov. Eric Holcomb announced that 64 businesses, community groups and school corporations across the state will receive a portion of the funding. The organizations can then offer that money to families in the form of on-site childcare for employees and childcare tuition benefits. The [Indiana Association for Home and Hospice Care](https://www.iahhc.org/) is one of the organizations receiving grant money. They say the $750,000 will be used as direct scholarships for home care workers to help them reimburse some childcare needs. The program is a partnership with the Indiana Chamber of Commerce and uses a portion of the remaining federal funds from the COVID-19 pandemic. A full list of the grant recipients can be found [here](https://www.in.gov/fssa/carefinder/files/6240-Employee-Sponsored-Child-Care-Fund-Awards.pdf).",
