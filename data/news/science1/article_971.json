    "text": "System (Xubuntu 22.04.3) has operated with no problems since original build date (4+ years), 500GB NVME boot drive, 16GB (2 * 8GB)RAM.\nWhat I wanted to accomplish was to remove AMD Ryzen 5 2600 along with Nvidia GK104 (Geforce GTX 760) from a homebuilt AsRock B450m/ac MB and replace it with an AMD Ryzen 5 5600G (Integrated Graphics.)\nFirst time I have tried an APU/CPU upgrade; not as simple as I first thought.\nSteps -\nPerformed a backup of all important data, etc.\nRemoved AMD APU Ryzen 5 2600 and GFX Nvidia GK104 (Geforce GTX 760) from B450m/ac\nInstalled AMD APU Ryzen 5 5600G and APU cooling fan.\nCleared CMOS jumper (CLRMOS1)\nWith only necessary power input, HDMI Video connected to B450m , and keyboard/mouse.\nApplied power\nChassis fans and APU fan begin spinning.\nDisplay flashes briefly, a few seconds later message appears on monitor,\" HDMI/MNL No signal\"\nAfter a few more seconds, fans spin down then the system attempts to reboot - same thing happens.\nAfter three repetitions, I removed power from system to seek advice.\nBios Version of B450M currently is P1.50. AsRock recommends BIOS version P2.60 for Cezanne APU (Ryzen 5 5600G).\n? Should I have updated BIOS as preliminary procedure?\n? Did I leave something out?\n? Any suggestions?\n@TheFu - Patiently awaiting your input since you do this sort of thing quite often.\nThanks in advance.",
