    "text": "An electrician with a passion for preservation restored an ancient piece of home electronics, allowing a woman to hear her departed mother’s voice on Christmas. The old animated version of Frosty the Snowman can pull many people back to their childhood; doubly so for Linda Swartz, who had an old book with an electronic recording of her mother reading it to her when she was young. Corrosion had long since rendered the circuitry unusable, but Linda kept it around for sentiment. Years went by, and as all mothers do, hers passed away in 2020. Enter Lars Robins, an electrician who came by to fix something in Linda’s house. In the course of his work he came across the Frosty the Snowman book. “I was really shocked because I didn’t think it was going to work,” Swartz [ told WCIA news.](https://www.wcia.com/news/everyday-hero-family-hears-late-loved-ones-voices-again-thanks-to-an-electrician/) “For a second there it looked like it wasn’t going to, but it did. I couldn’t be happier. Robins says his passion for preserving old things began when he worked as a teacher before his job as an electrician. Teachers are constantly creating and watching their kids create sentimental things, and understand how much old books and toys can mean even to adults.
