    "text": "UK-based Arksen has carved out a unique niche in the adventure travel world. Originally builders of aluminum-hulled ocean-going vessels for patrolling the very ends of the world’s seas, in 2023, they branched out into\nbespoke overland vehicles based on the original Land Rover Defender and Mercedes Unimog. This lineup even includes an EV version of the Defender 110. With design and build facilities on three continents, Arksen’s mission is to create an “ecosystem of adventure products and experiences” across the board. Their new line of apparel, Arksen Labs, launched earlier this year.\nArksen’s founder, Jasper Smith, says, “Our vision… has always been to build the ultimate adventure company [and] to create… the cross-over between performance [and] luxury for the most discerning customers and the most remote destinations on land or at sea. Arksen Overland and Arksen Labs performance wear represent critical steps on our journey towards that ecosystem, and there will be more to come in 2024.”\nDesigned “for both wilderness and urban adventures,” Arksen claims to use the world’s most advanced fabrics in their apparel line for Autumn and Winter 2023. Made in Europe from over 95% recycled materials and engineered for durability, longevity, and versatility, the Arksen Labs collection includes base layers and t-shirts, mid-weight layers, shells, and outerwear for extreme conditions.\nThe\nObex 3L waterproof jacket should be at home on deck or even at the wettest of camps. The Obex features recycled 3L Schoeller C-Change fabric and fully seam-taped waterproof construction, including waterproof zippers, and weighs in at a feathery 800 grams. Paired with either the Triton insulated jacket or the Lentus down jacket, this outerwear system will take on the worst winter has to throw at you.\nFor more on Arksen’s custom-built overland vehicles, cutting-edge marine engineering, and the Arksen Labs apparel line, visit Arksen’s\nwebsite.\n£695.00 |\nObex 3L Jacket\n£550.00 |\nLentus Down Jacket\n£495.00 |\nTriton Insulated Jacket\nRead more:\nAether Fall Collection :: Field Tested\nOur No Compromise Clause: We do not accept advertorial content or allow advertising to influence our coverage, and our contributors are guaranteed editorial independence.
