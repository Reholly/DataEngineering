    "text": "Joan Donovan, a leading battler of online disinformation.\nOnline disinformation specialist Joan Donovan on Wednesday took to social media to post what she called the “full account” of her separation from Harvard’s Kennedy School.\nIn a series of evening Tweets, Donovan repeated previous charges with new furor, claiming that staff and colleagues at the Kennedy School “heisted all my research programs and millions in funding.” She further claimed that the school is holding onto her intellectual property as part of a wider attempt at preventing Donovan from continuing her research elsewhere. Following her departure from Harvard, Donovan joined Boston University’s faculty this year.\nShe posted a scorching, 123-page account to X, formerly Twitter, which had been previously released roughly three weeks ago as part of a 248-page whistle-blower complaint demanding “an urgent and impartial investigation” into allegations of improper donor influence at the Kennedy School. Donovan alleges in the complaint that she was fired after she began analyzing a trove of documents pointing to “significant public harm” caused by Facebook parent company Meta.\nThe controversy involving Donovan is just one publicity headache for Harvard, which is also reeling from plagiarism allegations lodged against President Claudine Gay and the continued fallout from Gay’s congressional testimony earlier this month relating to campus antisemitism.\n“If you think the plagiarism scandal or the failure to address antisemitism and Islamophobia are the biggest problems facing Harvard today, read my account of how donors from Facebook influenced Dean Elmendorf to shut down my research lab and prevent me from digging into Meta,” Donovan said Wednesday via X, where she boasts some 45,000 followers.\nHarvard has denied the allegations of donor interference, saying Facebook didn’t exert influence on research, and they say Donovan was not fired.\n“The [whistle-blower] document’s allegations of unfair treatment and donor interference are false,” said James F. Smith, a Kennedy School spokesperson, in a statement earlier this month. “The narrative is full of inaccuracies and baseless insinuations, particularly the suggestion that Harvard Kennedy School allowed Facebook to dictate its approach to research.”\nSmith declined further comment Thursday.\nReached via email Thursday, Donovan said she wants the “public to understand that HKS did not only shut me down, but are continuing my research programs and took over $3 million in funding earmarked for my research. It is academically dishonest to do such a thing.”\nIn her disclosure, Donovan alleges that Kennedy School leadership used her team’s “work and my credibility” to solicit donations, without the scholar’s knowledge, including a $5 million grant to the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy made by a donor who was vocally supportive of Donovan’s research.\nThe account says Donovan, now an assistant professor at BU, had been hired by the Kennedy School in December 2018 on an initial one-year contract as head of the school’s Technology and Social Change Project.\nShe was promoted in February 2020 to research director of the Kennedy School’s august Shorenstein Center, the account says.\nDonovan told the Globe via email Thursday that the center has failed “to cite me as the founder of these major programs, while also seeking additional funding on my legacy research.”\nThings initially became contentious in October 2021, as Kennedy School Dean Doug Elmendorf saw Donovan’s research as adverse to the school’s relationship with Facebook and Meta, according to her complaint, filed “under penalty of perjury.”\nElmendorf had no comment Thursday.\n“Ultimately, in August 2023, the Kennedy School culminated their years-long systematic effort to silence my team’s work by terminating my employment contract and shutting down a fully-funded research program within the Kennedy School,” Donovan says in her account.\nThe Ivy League university, which currently boasts a healthy endowment of $50.7 billion, has previously disputed Donovan’s account of her separation from Harvard.\nDonovan has aired her allegations through Whistleblower Aid, a legal nonprofit representing her. Neither Donovan nor the legal group had said whether she intends to formally sue Harvard for damages.\n“We filed this declaration with the Mass AG and Federal Dept of Ed. And are waiting to hear if they will investigate,” Donovan said Thursday via email. “I’ve also been meeting with Congressional staffers on both sides of the aisle, who are looking into ways to support me as I try to reclaim my research and funding.”\nDonovan said earlier this month through Whistleblower Aid that she’s asking the Department of Education’s civil rights division to investigate whether the university violated her right to free speech and her academic freedom. She’s also asking the state attorney general to investigate whether Harvard misused or donor funds earmarked for her research.\nIn addition to Whistleblower Aid, Donovan said, she’s hired counsel to address claims of wrongful termination, constructive dismissal, and violating her right to speech, though she hopes to avoid litigation. Donovan said she wants her intellectual property returned and demanded more than $3 million in donations be refunded to donors.\nThe Kennedy School said that when the faculty leader of Donovan’s project left Harvard, the school tried to find a replacement. “After that effort did not succeed, the project was given more than a year to wind down. Joan Donovan was not fired, and most members of the research team chose to remain at the School in new roles,” Smith said in the statement put out a few weeks ago.\nSmith also defended the school’s research.\n“Harvard University and Harvard Kennedy School continue to carry out pathbreaking research on misinformation and the role of social media in society,” Smith said. “For example, a Kennedy School faculty member has constructed and posted online the Facebook Archive, the only academic archive that makes available to researchers thousands of leaked Facebook documents.”\nBut Donovan alleges that Kennedy School leadership “suddenly began restricting” her research capabilities and directed Donovan to make her research and public profile less prominent in the fall of 2021.\nDonovan, who had a $3 million annual research budget, alleged that she faced internal resistance in hiring, bringing in fellows, and starting a podcast after Harvard accepted the $500 million donation.",
