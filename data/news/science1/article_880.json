At press time, the coin’s Weighted Sentiment was pegged at 1.441, per Santiment’s data.\nThe price surge in the last 24 hours has pushed BSV’s key momentum indicators to multi-month highs, AMBCrypto found.\nThese indicators observed on a 24-hour chart experienced sharp upticks as BSV traded at its year-to-date high. For example, the values of the coin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) were 87.16 and 83.47, respectively.\nWhile these values indicated a significant rise in BSV’s buying pressure in the last 24 hours, it also showed that the market was overheated.\nIs your portfolio green?
