Edwin Nieves, 837th Training Squadron, tilts a door panel, as Intendente Alexander Pacheco, 837th Training Squadron, assists with assembling the shoot house at the Inter-American Air Forces Academy at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland, Texas, Jan. 10, 2023. The shoot house is among the newest equipment at the academy that will be used to train international military students from partner nations. The facility consists of modular wood panels that can be easily moved and reconfigured into different layouts, ensuring students remain challenged. (U.S. Air Force photo by Vanessa R.
