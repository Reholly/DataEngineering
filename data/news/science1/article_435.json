    "text": "Thinking greener and cleaner: Waste management company gives tips on recycling after the holidays GEORGETOWN, Del. – After opening up all those Christmas gifts, it can be hard to distinguish what’s recyclable from what’s not. Environmental Educator at Joan’s Crossroads Landfill, Andi Errico said sorting through your waste is crucial in ensuring it gets dropped off at the right place. “If you think about all your trash and waste, if it went to the landfill, it’ll fill them up a lot faster than if we were to be separated,” Errico said. Cardboard boxes, wrapping paper and even Christmas trees are just a few of the items that the landfill finds good use in after the holidays. Errico said every recyclable item that’s dropped off has a bigger purpose. “When it comes to yard waste, which would include your holiday trees, those are mulched on site, at our landfills,” Errico said. “Then, it’s used to cover the landfill at night, to cap the landfill for the day, to make sure nothing escapes.” The recycling effort shouldn’t stop right after the holidays. Errico said if everyone does their part, Delaware should be able to increase the amount of diverted recyclables in the long run. “I would love, for people in 2024, to increase their recycling,” Errico said. “We have so many people in this world, and we all produce waste.” “The statistic is, every American throws away 4.5 pounds of trash a day, and we have billions of people, and that accumulates pretty fast,” Errico added.",
