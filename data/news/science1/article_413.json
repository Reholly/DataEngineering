    "text": "(TNS) — In January, Highmark Health health insurance customers will be able to use a digital tool intended to provide faster, better access to mental health care. Highmark Health has partnered with Spring Health, which provides technology that will connect Highmark members to services ranging from mental health assessments to in-person or virtual appointments and therapy to crisis support. Members will be able to take an online assessment for about a dozen conditions including anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, substance use disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder. They will receive a personalized care plan and access to appointments other services, including medication management. Spring Health says it provides services for more than 4,500 companies around the country and has helped nearly 70% of its users significantly improve their mental health within six weeks. The services are available to children and teens as well as adults. They will be available through Highmark’s “My Highmark” member platform. The services will be available to people who have Highmark coverage through their job, Highmark Affordable Care Act plans, and Highmark Medicare Advantage plans for seniors. “Together, Highmark Health and Spring Health are advancing the future state of mental and behavioral health,” Dr. Anil Singh, Highmark Health’s executive medical director of population and curated health, said in a news release. “Expanding access and making it easier for members to engage with a personalized treatment plan helps us intervene earlier, driving a cultural shift in the behavioral health space and cost savings, which Highmark Health reinvests in the consumer experience as part of our Living Health model.” Highmark health insurance plans cover more than 7 million people in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Delaware and New York, according to Becker’s Behavioral Health. Based in Pittsburgh, Highmark has substantial operations in central Pennsylvania, including a campus just outside Camp Hill in Cumberland County.",
