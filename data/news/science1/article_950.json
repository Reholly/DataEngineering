    "text": "NOIDA: Riding on major investments it has received in data centres, the UP government will offer 10 more land parcels, together measuring 50 acres, for similar projects as the roadmap for the Noida-Yamuna Expressway (YXP) region to become India's data centre hub takes shape. 106363106So far, the Hiranandani group's Yotta, the Adani Group and Microsoft have been allotted land for data centres in Noida and Greater Noida. Sify Infinite Spaces and Jackson Ltd were allocated 5 acres each in Sector 28 off the Yamuna expressway, which is fast emerging as a business hub because of the upcoming international airport in Jewar.YEIDA CEO Arun Vir Singh said that under the new scheme 10 land parcels of 5 acres each will be allotted in Sector 28. Altogether, 100 acres of land have been earmarked in the sector for developing the data centre parks and the allotments will be done through interviews based on objective parameters, he added.The state's first data centre was built last year by the Hiranandani Group on 20 acres in Greater Noida's Knowledge Park 5. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath inaugurated its first building - out of six - on October 31 last year. Two more buildings are likely to be ready next year.In Noida, MNCs like Microsoft, MAQ, and the Adani Group have acquired lands for setting up data parks. The Adani Group has been allotted two land parcels in Noida - one 8.5-acre plot in Sector 62 and another 10-acre plot in Sector 80. The company has proposed to invest over Rs 7,400 crore and create over 3,700 jobs through the two projects.Microsoft has acquired 15 acres of land in Sector 145, where the company plans to set up a software park and a data centre for Rs 1,800 crore. The units will employ more than 3,500 people. MAQ has been allotted 4 acres in Sector 145 for its IT facility.NTT Ltd, a Japanese technology firm, acquired 6 acres in Techzone 4 in 2021 and is set to start its 70 MW data centre next month. The company will invest Rs 700 crore in the project which is expected to create 300 jobs.Sudeep Gupta, the director of Artha Infratech, the development partner of NTT's data centre, said, one of the key reasons for the proliferation of data centre parks in the Noida-YXP region was an attractive policy drawn up by the UP government to provide multiple incentives to companies.\\\"With several companies already allotted land in the region, it has created an ecosystem. This is now attracting more companies. North India, a big market for data consumption, was in need of a data centre hub and Noida has grabbed the opportunity,\\\" Gupta said. Currently, Mumbai leads the way in the data centres in the country.The UP government is keen on developing a data centre ecosystem matching global standards in the state. With a target investment of Rs 20,000 crore by developing a 250 megawatt (MW) industry, it framed the data centre policy in 2021 offering various incentives in land allotment, stamp duties, and infrastructure. To cater to the energy needs of the proposed hub, the state government is also planning to set up solar energy parks.As per UP's policy, with more than 1 billion mobile and 45 million internet users, the data centre industry is expected to grow faster in India as compared to the rest of the world. Currently, about 20% of the world's total data is generated in India, while data storage capacity within the country is limited to a meagre 2%. Therefore, most of the data is stored outside the country.Demand for data protection is also growing in the country given increasing data traffic and usage as well as the confidentiality of the data. Recent estimates show India's 375MW data centre capacity is growing rapidly and is expected to add more than 750 MW capacity by the end of 2025.",
