    "text": "Thursday, December 28th 2023 [Steam Announces Best Steam Games of 2023](/317191/steam-announces-best-steam-games-of-2023) Steam has announced the full list of Best of Steam games for this year across several categories.

Categories include Top Sellers, New Releases, Most Played, Early Access, Steam Deck, Controller, and VR.Source: The Top Seller list include Baldur's Gate 3 from Larian Studios, which is also the Game of the Year winner, Hogwarts Legacy, which was a big game this year, DOTA 2 and Counter Strike 2, Cyberpunk 2077, Starfield, Lost Ark, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, Apex Legends, PUBG Battlegrounds, Destiny 2, and Sons of the Forest. Some of the Top New Releases category, which is measured by gross revenue, include Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon, Cities: Skylines II, Resident Evil 4, Payday 3, Remnant II, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, FC 24, as well as a few titles that are also top sellers like Starfield, Baldur's Gate 3, Hogwarts Legacy. and Sons of the Forest. The Steam Deck category is pretty interesting and as measured by daily active players and including some familiar and popular titles like Starfield, Baldur's Gate 3, Resident Evil 4, Elden Ring, Hogwarts Legacy, Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, and Cyberpunk 2077, it also has Half-Life and Skyrim on the list, which were some great games that are once again popular thanks to Steam Deck. The VR list include Half-Life Alyx, Skyrim VR, Pavlov, Ghosts of Tabor, Beat Sabre, VTOL VR, and some other games. You can check out the rest of the titles in all categories over at Steam Store.

[#2](/forums/posts/5167230) [Tomgang](/forums/members/tomgang.154607/) Thats great and all. But why are these great games not on the list:confused: The Walking Dead: Destinies Skull Island: Rise of Kong The Lord of the Rings: Gollum And specially The day before I mean they are the greatest games of not just this decade, but the century. i have played thrown them several times and put thousands of hours in each game... They are simply great games (what i really think:fear:of these games) games not on the list:confused: The Walking Dead: Destinies Skull Island: Rise of Kong The Lord of the Rings: Gollum And specially The day before I mean they are the greatest games of not just this decade, but the century. i have played thrown them several times and put thousands of hours in each game...

AssimilatorA game over 3 years old is still one of the top-played VR titles, truly shows how \"well\" the VR market is doing...Most of those games are that old, a few new titles but a lot of 2017-2019 era games [#4](/forums/posts/5167237) [Scrizz](/forums/members/scrizz.42078/) AssimilatorA game over 3 years old is still one of the top-played VR titles, truly shows how \"well\" the VR market is doing... Destiny 2, Lost Ark, Apex Legends, DOTA 2, PUBG BattlegroundsWith that logic, it shows how \"well\" the entire market is doing if most of the top games non-VR are also 3+ years old. Nothing uniquely good or bad with VR game trend based on that metric. ;) [#5](/forums/posts/5167253) [ZoneDymo](/forums/members/zonedymo.66089/) these list always show just how fake it all is [#6](/forums/posts/5167318) [ZeppMan217](/forums/members/zeppman217.85360/) ScrizzWith that logic, it shows how \"well\" the entire market is doing if most of the top games non-VR are also 3+ years old.Now that's a weird take, considering the games you mentioned are all GaaS with regular content and other updates. Nothing uniquely good or bad with VR game trend based on that metric. ;)",
