    "text": "( MENAFN - ForPressRelease) Delhi, Dec 28, 2023 - Ayurhealthline Remedies Pvt Ltd, a leading Ayurvedic treatment center specializing in natural remedies for Vitiligo and other skin disorders, is proud to announce its comprehensive treatment approach for Vitiligo, which is based on ancient Ayurvedic principles.\nAyurhealthline focuses on holistic healing by addressing the root cause of Vitiligo, believed to be an imbalance in the doshas, particularly the Pitta dosha, according to Ayurveda. By correcting this imbalance, Ayurhealthline aims to provide effective and lasting relief from Vitiligo.\nCustomized Treatment Plans:\nAt Ayurhealthline, the treatment process begins with a thorough consultation, where the experienced Ayurvedic doctors assess the patientâ€TMs medical history, lifestyle, and dietary habits. A personalized treatment plan is then recommended based on the individual's dosha imbalance and the stage of Vitiligo. The treatment may involve a combination of oral medication, external applications, Panchakarma therapies such as Virechan and Basti, and lifestyle modifications. Dietary recommendations, including the avoidance of pitta-aggravating foods, are an integral part of the treatment process.\nExpert Guidance from Dr. Ravish Kamal:\nDr. Ravish Kamal, a renowned Vitiligo Specialist at Ayurhealthline, emphasizes the importance of a long-term commitment to treatment for optimal results. According to Dr. Kamal, \"Ayurveda works by correcting the underlying imbalance in the body and stimulating melanin production. Patients need to follow the treatment plan diligently for 6-9weeks to see significant repigmentation and up to 10-12 months approximately (it can vary case to case) for complete cure.\"\nNatural Ingredients and Herbal Extracts:\nAyurhealthline stands out by using only natural ingredients and herbal extracts in its treatments and medicines. These formulations are derived from ancient Ayurvedic texts and undergo strict quality control measures.
