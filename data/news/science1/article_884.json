    "text": "Chinanews.com, December 12 (Reporter Guan Na Meng Xiangjun) helped Saudi Arabia and Iran achieve the \"reconciliation of the century\", actively persuaded peace talks in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and the situation between Russia and Ukraine, and achieved positive results in addressing climate change... In 29, China will inject stability into the turbulent international situation and contribute wisdom and strength to global governance. Chinanews.com specially invited Su Hao, director of the Center for Strategic and Peace Studies of China Foreign Affairs University and vice president of the Institute of Global Governance and Development of Chinese University, and Guo Xiangang, former vice president and researcher of the China Institute of International Studies, to give an in-depth interpretation of China's contribution to maintaining world peace and stability in 2023. Experts pointed out that China's diplomacy has achieved fruitful results and achievements in 2023, injecting more positive energy into the world. Contribute solutions and wisdom to maintain world peace and tranquility From March 2023 to 3, 6, representatives of Saudi Arabia and Iran held a dialogue in Beijing under the active mediation of the Chinese government. After the meeting, China, Saudi Arabia and Iran signed and issued a joint statement, announcing that Saudi Arabia and Iran agreed to restore diplomatic relations. In less than two months, the Middle East region has played the \"chord\" many times, and under the witness of the Chinese side, Saudi Arabia and Iran announced the resumption of diplomatic relations in Beijing. The foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia and Syria, as well as the foreign ministers of Turkey and Egypt, have exchanged visits for the first time in a decade. On June 6, local time, the Iranian Embassy in Saudi Arabia officially reopened. The picture shows the scene of the ceremony. With the successful mediation of the resumption of diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran, China has put into practice the important concepts of the Global Security Initiative. \"Seek peace, even if it is far away in China,\" Qatar's Al Jazeera TV said in an Arabic proverb. Guo Xiangang, former vice president and researcher of the China Institute of International Studies, said, \"Saudi Arabia and Iran have hated each other for many years, belonging to two major branches, Sunni and Shia, and the two countries have very serious antagonism due to sectarian issues. And with the mediation of China, it is a very remarkable thing that the two 'enemies' were finally able to reach a settlement. ” \"After China helped Saudi Arabia and Iran reconcile, the global evaluation of China's diplomacy is very high, and China has done a very remarkable thing, which is conducive to the stability of the entire Middle East region.\" Guo Xiangang pointed out. China has always advocated promoting the peaceful settlement of relevant issues through political negotiations, and has been actively promoting peace talks in various ways and making unremitting efforts to this end. On February 2 and 21, one year after the escalation of the Ukraine crisis, China released two major documents, the Concept Paper on the Global Security Initiative and China's Position on the Political Settlement of the Ukraine Crisis. China is not a party to the Ukraine crisis, but it has never stood idly by, but has taken an objective and fair position and sincerely persuaded and promoted peace talks. After the outbreak of a new round of Palestinian-Israeli conflict, China, as the rotating presidency of the UN Security Council in November, promoted the adoption of Resolution 11. This is the first time since the end of 2712 that the Security Council has adopted a resolution on the Palestinian-Israeli issue, and the first since the outbreak of a new round of Palestinian-Israeli conflict on October 2016, 2023. On October 10, local time, after the Israeli army attacked a high-rise building in Gaza City, the scene was full of flames and thick smoke. Guo Xiangang pointed out that judging from China's handling of regional affairs such as the Ukraine crisis and the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, these can be said to be China's great achievements in diplomacy. \"China's Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative, Global Civilization Initiative and other concepts have been recognized and accepted by more and more countries. Many countries have realized through practice that China's plan meets the development needs of the international community. ” Addressing climate change demonstrates the responsibility of major countries China's responsibilities and responsibilities as a major country are also reflected in how to deal with the difficult problems that all mankind needs to face together. During the 75th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP15), the Chinese delegation had extensive dialogue and communication with all parties, comprehensively demonstrating China's pragmatic actions and remarkable achievements in actively responding to climate change and strengthening international cooperation on climate change, and made important contributions to promoting convergence and overcoming differences. Su Hao, director of the Center for Strategic and Peace Studies at China Foreign Affairs University and deputy dean of the Institute of Global Governance and Development at Chinese University, pointed out that China actively assumes the responsibility of a major country and promotes the smooth progress of the climate change conference.

On the other hand, Guo Xiangang said, \"China has also made great efforts to improve the domestic environment, deserts have made great progress, the area of forests is expanding, the water of rivers and lakes is becoming cleaner, there are more and more birds, and the whole ecological environment is developing for the better, which is also conducive to climate governance.\" ” \"China's propositions and practices have provided strong impetus and support for global climate governance. In the future, as the issue of climate governance becomes more and more urgent, China's efforts in this regard will be recognized and supported by more and more countries. Guo Xiangang said. (ENDS)",
