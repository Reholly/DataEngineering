    "text": "A daily planning pad of 50 tear-off sheets you can use to map out your day. It's got space for what you're grateful for, priorities you must do today, a to-do list, appointments, achievements, meal planning, logging exercise, and notes and doodles, plus a water intake tracker and a blank clock to fill in if you do better with images than words. They truly thought of everything, and this pretty pad will help you feel so accomplished!\nAmazon, www.amazon.com It's made by a family-owned, Wisconsin-based small stationery biz.\nPromising review: \"So glad I bought this! This is a great little notepad! Cute, practical, and with just enough writing space to capture the most important things. Well worth the price!\" — Nikki Grillo\nGet it from Amazon for $12.99 (also available in nine other styles).\n2. A set of two whip-making pumps that'll turn your go-to foaming cleanser into a marshmallow fluff-like foam so it'll go on more smoothly and feel like you're seriously pampering yourself every time you wash your face. Regular cleanser is s 2023.\nAmazon, www.amazon.com Promising review: \"Great price for a set of two! I was able to keep one for myself and give one to my mother. It is very easy to use and extends the life of my products while the foam that is produced is easy on my skin.\" — Vicky\nGet a pair from Amazon for $8.99+ (available in four color combinations).\n3. OMG-worthy 3D-printed, wearable chopsticks so you can snack like a master — I'm talking no chip seasoning on your fingers, meaning your keyboard, gaming controller, or whatever you're multitasking on stays clean. These are the kinds of innovations you dreamt of as a child.\nRidha 3D Printing/Etsy They're from a small biz based in Dallas.\nPromising review: \"I love these wearable chopsticks! No more having to wipe my hands off before using my mouse; I can just wear this. It's fun, convenient, and mess-free. Plus, it forces you to snack a little more slowly. I also love the color I got, and it seems durable for the price.\" — Sara K\nGet it from Ridha 3D Printing on Etsy for $4.90+ (available in 23 colors and two styles).\n4. Or some fun lightsaber chopsticks to ensure no lunch will ever be a sad desk lunch in 2024. You're an adult, so you actually are allowed to play with your food. And with these babies, no one would have the heart to ~force~ you to stop, anyway. Emma Lord / BuzzFeed, Amazon BuzzFeed Shopping writer Emma Lord loves these. She writes: \"As you can see from the above GIF, I bought these for myself, and I love them to pieces. TBH, I use them as decor every bit as much as I use them to eat. Sometimes I just keep them in my work area to light them up during the day to feel fancy. They toggle back and forth between a bunch of different colors, like red, blue, yellow, purple, and multicolor, so you can either make them match *or* have a red and blue one together and bring ~balance~ to the Force.\"\nPromising review: \"The chopsticks are very durable, and the glow is bright. They're a bit bigger than I expected — but very pleased nonetheless with the product because it serves the purpose and is entertaining for kids, right up to adult Star Wars nerds. It also made the perfect gift for my fellow Star Wars nerds. I've been too busy playing with them rather than using them to eat food — but hopefully, that will eventually happen before the batteries need changing.\" — Anthony\nGet two pairs from Amazon for $13.97 (available in two styles).\n5. A nourishing shea butter and hyaluronic acid shower lotion for a smarter way to hydrate your parched winter skin post-shower. It's designed to be applied when your skin is still wet and your pores are most open to absorb all the moisturizing goodness — whoever came up with this is a skincare genius. Amazon Promising review: \"I've been using this product for one week, and my skin has never been softer. I'm in my early 50s, and every year around fall, my skin begins to dry out. By January, it's actually cracking and painful, and showering only made things worse. That's why this year, I decided to start moisturizing BEFORE the cold winter months. This product leaves your skin soft, smooth, and well hydrated. But best of all, it doesn't feel greasy. It's gentle, which is a concern for me since I have sensitive skin. A little of this product goes a long way. The instructions say put a dime-size dollop of lotion on each arm and leg, and that really is all you need for your extremities. It spreads smoothly and covers a large area. Moisturizing while still damp from the shower is definitely the way to go. This also has a very clean scent that smells like a soft mixture of coconut and vanilla, but I think that may actually be the scent coming from the shea butter (not sure). I'm sold on this stuff.\" — Flipp'n Pages\nGet it from Amazon for $9.99 .\n6. A shirt-folding board , because maybe Sheldon Cooper was on to something. This wonder will make folding clothes more satisfying and fun (a low bar, I know) and get your tees and other garments folded so well that they'll actually take up less space. Here's to no more procrastinating putting those clean clothes away this year.\nwww.amazon.com Promising review: \"My first reaction? 'Why did I buy this?' Then I opened the box and wasn't too convinced about the way it looked, as some edges look like they would quickly snap with use. Then I gave it a try with a couple of shirts I had just washed, and next thing you know I simply had to do my entire drawer! Everything folds so pretty, neat, and easy. I still couldn't believe it, so I ended up organizing our bedsheets and towels. I am amazed at how much of a game changer this is. Must try! Am in love with how beautiful it left my clothes.\" — Jesus Antonio Vedia\nGet it from Amazon for $16.99 (available in five colors).\n7. A spa-worthy exfoliating mitt you can use after a long shower or bath soak to banish all your crusty, dry winter skin and feel like a whole new person.\nwww.amazon.com Take it from the user below, who left one of the best and funniest reviews I've read in a while. 😂\nPromising review: \"Let me start by saying, I never knew that I was a walking, living, breathing mummy zombie lady. The first time I used this glove, I soaked in the bath to get my skin nice and prepped. I whipped that thing out expecting a bit of skin to fluff off, but what ensued was 30 minutes straight of scrubbing skin off that had built up since I was a toddler. I swore at one point I found old Band-Aid goo that had been buried under years of dead skin. OK, maybe that's not true, but with the amount of dead skin that came off my body, it could have been! I finally finished removing my snake skin and began draining the bathtub. What was left was like a scene from a horror movie. The entire bottom of the bathtub couldn't be seen because of the numerous chunks of dead skin clinging to it. That's not counting what went down the drain. I can only imagine that the creatures down there will one day rise to hunt me down and eat me because they gained an affinity for the taste of my flesh. I had to take an extra 15 minutes to clean my bathtub due to the gray, zombie skin that refused to be rinsed away. In other words, if you don't want to be a mummy, zombie person, this glove is your ticket to the living realm. Buy the glove; join the living — thank me later.\" — Shannon Graham\nGet one from Amazon for $7.99 or a pair for $13.99 .\n8. Or a Luv Scrub , aka an exfoliating nylon bath cloth inspired by a common grooming routine product used in West Africa. The long and stretchy cloth will exfoliate, turn each shower into a a spa-like experience, and leave you with remarkably soft skin. Can a regular washcloth do that? Didn't think so. Luv Scrub It's even long enough that you can easily scrub your back! Several of my coworkers have tried and love this product, which is from a Black woman-owned small business!\nPromising review: \"I absolutely love this exfoliator. I got it to remove my self-tan in the spots that never seem to go away (my ankles) and it did amazingly. It removed all of the old tan and buffed away all of the dry skin so it was perfectly prepared for my next application of self-tan. Not to mention, adding soap to it makes the soap lather so well. My husband is now addicted to it as well! I love that it dries completely and cannot be a source of mold when left in the shower caddy like exfoliators I have used before. I love it! Definitely 10/10!!\" — kcaudill\nGet it from Luv Scrub for $18 (available in seven colors) or Ulta for $18 (available in five colors).\n9. An impressive peanut butter knife specially designed to get EVERY LAST DROP of goodness out of the jar, without getting your hands all sticky. It'll save you money, mess, and meal-prep time as you're making your weekly (daily? hourly?) sammies.\nwww.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"It will save your life! Give you wings!

Your glass will always be half full! You will suddenly find yourself only grabbing on-sale items when grocery shopping (by accident even!).

After just scraping the bottom of a big ol' peanut butter jar out in two seconds effortlessly. It might look big and awkward (it's a monster of a one-use tool), but seriously, if you have an intense dislike for getting PB on your fingertips dealing with jars — this is the solution you've been looking for. Long live PB-Jife.\n*Will not do anything in that first paragraph. I'm sorry.\" — CW\nGet it from Amazon for $12.99 .\n10.

No more glancing up and down constantly and losing your place, which means you'll get things done faster. A small hack for a more productive 2024! www.amazon.com Promising review: \"This simple item has made my life easier. It is extremely easy to install and to use. It has increased my productivity in the office when needing to refer to a hard document. When not in use, you can easily hide it behind your screen. It has two options to hold paper: one that you can just stick in and the other to clip on a bunch of documents.\" — Elee the Lawyer\nGet it from Amazon for $11.69 .\n11.

This'll let you make it it out of the house on time *and* with the perfect look, and it's long-lasting, too!\nwww.amazon.com , Amazon It comes with two stamps (one for the right eye, one for the left), both of which have a black liquid liner pen on the other end, so you've got everything you need to create the purr -fect look.\nPromising review: \"I just want to make my morning routine as easy as possible. I love winged liner but I don’t have the steady hand for it without mistakes. This makes a perfect and consistent wing every time. Love it! I ordered the 10 mm and now i’ll have to try the 12 mm!\" — Julie B\nGet it from Amazon for $12.72+ (available in three sizes).\n13.

Emma Lord/BuzzFeed Mouthwatchers is a dentist-founded small business specializing in upgraded toothbrushes. While these can't be a full substitute for flossing, they're helpful if you don't floss as much as you should (I feel you). As always, your dentist will have the best advice on the routine that's best for you!\nPsst...I personally love the travel versions of these that have a built-in case!\nPromising review: \"Seriously! I love this toothbrush, it’s the best one out there. I’ve tried all different kinds — I’m always looking for the next best one, but this is it for me. I feel like this manual brush would give any electric one a run for its money. Just buy it! You won’t be disappointed!\" — Sarah T.\nGet an extra-soft version from Amazon for $4.94+ (available in four colors and in more styles and quantities here ).\n14. A suction cup pillow for the edge of your bathtub to make your self-care soaks even more relaxing this year. Because IDK about you, but at least one bubble bath per weekend has become nonnegotiable for me lately. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"This bath pillow is wonderful! I had the blow-up terry pillow and ditched it for this and I am so glad I did. This pillow is extremely comfortable and the best pillow I have ever tried. It looks as though it would attach easily to any tub. My tub is curved and there was no problem with it conforming to my tub. It stays put with no slippage. The suction cups hold very well . If you want to remove it, then I recommend peeling the suction cups away with your fingernail to prevent ripping the pillow. I recommend removing it and placing it on the side of the tub to air dry to prevent any mold from building up behind it. You will not be disappointed.\" — Christina\nGet it from Amazon for $16.94+ (available in two sizes and seven colors).\n15. Amazing Rocketbook index cards , which, like the brand's famous smart notebooks , can be scanned into the Rocketbook app for safekeeping, then wiped clean with water and reused endlessly.

The set comes with a pen but also works with any Pilot Frixion writing utensils.\nPromising review: \"I purchased these for my college-age kids for their studies at my daughter's urging (environmental reasons). It has been a great success! The Study Mode through the app has made studying for exams much easier and less of a hassle. No more bent cards. No more lost cards.

My daughter even connects her phone to her TV and turns studying into trivia night!\" — Amazon Customer\nGet a pack of 40 plus a pen and microfiber cloth from Amazon for $17.99 .\n16.

The bestselling, game-changing Oxo Tot grape cutter , which has over 11,000 5-star ratings for a reason — and that reason is it makes the usually tedious (but necessary!) task of cutting up grapes into smaller, safer pieces for kiddos easy, satisfying, and actually kinda fun! Just press down on the plunger tool to cut your kid's fave fruit into quarters. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com It's dishwasher safe 🙌! Check out why one parent on TikTok loves it in this vid . And psst...you can also use it to cut stuff like cherry tomatoes, berries, and olives!\nPromising review : \"When we went to search Amazon for 'grape cutters,' I was worried that we may have hit rock bottom. It doesn't get more simple than slicing a freaking grape. I mean it's not difficult, doesn't take an enormous amount of time, and isn't even really that inconvenient (at least no more than cutting any other toddler food)...yet, my wife and I found ourselves dreading the process every time our daughter wanted a handful of grapes. We bought this little gadget with low expectations and fully anticipated using it two times before throwing it in our kitchen drawer where it would inevitably sit for a year before we threw it away. Boy were we wrong. It only took one use before we realized that what we thought would be another useless novelty, was actually a parent's HOLY GRAIL of food preparation. No joke, I literally used it the other day to cut THREE grapes for MYSELF, just for the enjoyment. I only take time to write reviews on products that I feel are truly worth my time to endorse, and this little gadget was more than worthy. If your little one enjoys eating grapes, do yourself the unimaginable pleasure of buying this...you won't regret it.\" — Michael\nGet it from Amazon for $11.99 .\n23.

Dawn Platinum Powerwash Dish Spray , an awesome grease-buster that'll save you scrubbing and change the dishwashing game for good by making it actually kinda...fun?!? So long to the days of letting dishes pile up in the sink — with this stuff you'll be able (and want!) to do 'em right away. Amazon BuzzFeed Shopping editor Elizabeth Lilly loves this stuff! She says: \"I live in an apartment without a dishwasher, and I honestly use that as an excuse to order takeout instead of cooking. But as soon as I got my hands on a bottle of this stuff (regular Dawn is my go-to dish soap, BTW), I put it to use on both a saucepan I used to make homemade enchilada sauce *and* the casserole dish I baked those enchiladas in, which had a ton of caked-on food. It really does work like I say it does! Like, scary well.\"\nPromising review: \"Is it wrong that I wish this came with a holster for the spray gun? Seriously, I see a dirty dish and I want to pull it out, twirl the gun around my finger, and spray, just like in the wild, wild West. The soap is superior to any other; I even use it as a pre-wash for stains on my clothes. There's nothing it hasn't removed. The power wash sprayer is superior. It's easy to use, easy to whip out, soap stays soapy, and rinses clean. I don't feel like I'm wasting any or need to spray more. You can get in close and spray a cup; spray a little further back and you can hit a whole plate. I know it's sad to be this happy over something so simple, but it really does make a task that much easier, and that is appreciated. I will have a Power Wash spray bottle in the bathroom, laundry, kitchen, and pet area, because those are all the places I've carried it. Great product. The soap never fails, cuts through everything, gets rid of any greasy feeling on any material — pans, plastic, walls, and counters — and the spray is fun.\" — Sssshhhh\nGet a spray bottle and a refill bottle from Amazon for $8.44 .\n26. An adjustable showerhead with five spray modes to turn every shower into a luxury experience and solve your water pressure woes.\nAmazon Promising review: \"Affordable upgrade. Very pleasantly surprised with this affordable shower head. It was very easy to install, looks nice and significantly increased the water flow and pressure in our shower. It has five different settings which are easy to change using the small switch/lever. The shower head itself is also adjustable allowing you to direct the spray somewhat. I definitely recommend it.\" — J. Gibson\nGet it from Amazon for $9.99 .\n27. An as-seen-on- Shark Tank car dipping sauce holder that'll clip to your vents and make your regular drive-thru meals an even more wonderful experience this year. You'll pity your fellow fast food patrons who are still spilling BBQ all over their seats or balancing ranch precariously on their center console. www.amazon.com It's designed to be able to hold different sizes of sauce containers depending on whether you position them horizontally or vertically, and it even comes with a removable tray you can squeeze sauce packets into.\nPromising review: \"This is the best invention ever! I’m a sauce queen and this allows me to have sauce in my car without wasting it! Who ever invented this knows my love language!\" — Quintana\nGet a set of two from Amazon for $11.99 (available in four colors).\n28. A totes adorbs, teeny-tiny Dash waffle maker available in a classic waffle version or with cute shapes to add some fun to breakfast, snacks, brunch, or literally any time you decide is waffle o' clock. www.amazon.com , Amazon Promising review: \"I had no idea what a small waffle maker could do for my life. LOL. This has only one big flaw. The handle that sticks out in the front is either not big enough or just not designed well, so you can burn yourself trying to lift it. I either use a fork to knock it upwards after cooking (because it tends to stick a bit) or I use a mitten. This silly little thing is perfect. It is so simple. The nonstick surface really is nonstick. Kind of critical with a waffle maker, so the waffles come off clean without scraping and scrubbing. It makes a waffle in about two minutes. About the time it takes to make my coffee. The waffles look like an Eggo, but they are oh so much better. Definitely, depending on the batter, as good or better than any at a pancake shop. You plug it in, it warms up, and the light goes off. You open it, spoon in about two tablespoons of batter, and close it. The light comes on and when it goes off, the waffle that comes out is wonderful. Love this . I set it up and within one day I had more waffles than I have had in a year. Now I have them all the time. Great with tea, breakfast, coffee, dessert (ice cream, peanut butter, maple syrup...). \" — Amazon Customer\nGet it from Amazon for $9.50+ (available in 20 styles).\n29. A truly delightful set of patterned nail wrap stickers that will make it look like you got professional nail art done, but are actually a fraction of the price and will probably last longer. Trust me — my at-home nail routine hasn't been the same since I discovered this brand!!!\nSawyer And Scout/Etsy I ordered this set after trying out a different, now-sold-out pattern from this Utah-based shop, because I had to have more. I'm honestly blown away — I had these stickers on for over a week, and they were still over 90% intact on every finger, and not a single one had fallen off since I applied them. As if that wasn't enough, they're somehow only FIVE BUCKS. They weren't hard to apply or shape to my nails at all. All of that + the fact that this small biz makes tons and tons more designs for their wraps (which are made from real nail polish on medical-grade adhesive) = many more orders in my future. The only thing I didn't like was that there was a lot of pesky peeling involved to access each sticker, and that combined with my short nails mean that the process made a decent amount of waste. Still, I'm super excited about finding this brand, and the fact that each set comes with a few extras means you have backups if you mess up *or* you can save them for future manis to come (hello accent nails!). And psst, another tip: I finished off my mani with my favorite Orly top coat .\nGet 16 wraps from Sawyer and Scout on Etsy for $4.99 .\n30. One Line a Day: A Five-Year Memory Book , which'll motivate even the busiest people to take some time to journal each day — a great thing to start in 2024, though you can pick this up any time! Plus, once you use it for a full year, you'll be treated to a glance back in time from that day last year every time you go to add a new entry. Katy Herman/BuzzFeed Promising review: \"This journal is a great way to get into the habit of writing about your day. More importantly, it's a wonderful way to get yourself to remember the things you'd been doing on the same day in previous years. It also makes for a great hand-me-down for later generations. I got this after going to a family reunion and a bunch of us read through parts of a five-year journal an older family member had left behind. You might be surprised how much your loved ones will appreciate being able to read even short entries about the way you spend your days. Highly recommend. This is a sturdy notebooks and after a full year of use, it's holding strong. I've gotten another one of these as a gift for a friend.\" — Amrit\nGet it from Amazon for $13.92 .\n31. A miraculous automatic bleach toilet-cleaning system that'll actually *eliminate* a regular chore from your 2024 routine completely. Once installed, it sends cleaner into the bowl every time you flush, so your toilet will basically clean itself!\nwww.amazon.com It's super quick to install, and one cartridge can last up to three months!\nPromising review: \"I use to use those deodorizer tablets for all my toilets in my home, and they worked. However, the chemicals from the tablets would harden the plastic/rubber flap valves in the toilet, and cause them to slow leak overnight. My water bill would be high every month. Once I switched to the Fluidmaster 8300 dispenser, keeping my toilets clean and odorless become easy. Plus maintenance on my toilets decreased! The cartridges last three months, and replacing them requires no tools. Highly recommend.\" — Mikiloti\nGet it from Amazon for $10.77 .\n32. Elizavecca Milky Piggy carbonated bubble clay mask , a top-rated, blackhead-banishing, and just plain F-U-N mask that starts to bubble once you apply it. Even without the skin benefits, it'd be worth it for the selfies. www.amazon.com It has over 11,000 (!!!!) 5-star ratings and comes with an application spatula. I've personally worked this into my routine as a skincare treat — it makes my skin look so glowy and clean!\nPromising review: \"Wow! I purchased this on a whim after seeing one of my favorite Youtubers try it out. I didn't expect a lot from it. I tried it out and was shocked!!! The mask was simple (and fun) to use. I wasn't sure I felt a lot happening while it was on, but it was pretty cool how the bubbles started to grow off of my face. Upon inspection after using this mask I was completely amazed. My face felt cleaner than it has in a very long time AND my pores looked amazing! I don't remember a time when I felt like my pores looked great before using this mask. I would highly recommend this mask to anyone. It's also so much cheaper than the GlamGlow ones I have been using (and didn't see near these results from).\" — K. Textor\nGet it from Amazon for $9.99 .\n33. An instantly downloadable and printable cleaning checklist that'll actually *create* a cleaning routine for you. It's divided by day and room to help you break up the seemingly overwhelming task of cleaning your home while making sure you don't miss a spot. CreativeTypeStore/Etsy This Canada-based small biz specializes in printable organizing aids.\nPromising reviews: \"I have adult children living with me at the moment. I needed clear cleaning instructions/expectations for them to contribute with the house. This easy printout has solved so many arguments. It works great for our situation.\" — Jennifer Jarvis\n\"I ended up editing this a little bit to better fit our needs but this was perfect! It made it so easy. My house hasn’t been this clean in a while. Lol\" — Kathleen Cronin\nGet the download of an editable Canva template and PDF, JPG, and SVG formats from Creative Type Store on Etsy for $3.45 .\n34. A massaging, exfoliating, and blood flow-increasing scalp brush over 65,000 (!!!) people swear by to give you that feeling of someone deep shampooing your hair at a salon that you miss so much, not to mention help with dandruff and buildup, and even help encourage hair growth! www.amazon.com Promising review: \"Okay, so this is a bit of TMI — I have extremely curly hair and eczema. I would scratch my scalp and buildup of oil and dead skin would be under my fingernails, and no matter how hard I scrubbed in the shower nothing took it away. It felt like a layer of wax was on my head 24/7. On top of this, after scrubbing my head raw in the shower, my scalp would be so unbearably itchy afterwards! I tried everything. Co-washing, no shampooing, anti-dandruff shampoo, oils, not washing my hair every week, etc. Nothing helped. It was to the point the itching and scratching left me bleeding and in tears. I bought this on a whim after reading other reviews — and I will NEVER go back. I look FORWARD to washing my hair now! The first time I used it, I experimentally scratched my head and there was NOTHING under my nails. My scalp didn’t itch AT ALL, even after running product through it and letting my hair dry. I have never looked forward to washing my hair, and now I LOVE IT. I’m considering buying another one for travel, and some for my friends — I literally cannot fathom how such a simple-looking product has changed my life. How do the silicone bristles clean more than my own fingers? I’ll never know. But I love it.\" — Katie Hallum\nGet it from Amazon for $7.59+ (available in three colors).\nYou to your currently boring daily routine: Tap to play GIF Tap to play GIF Max\nThe reviews used in this post have been edited for length and clarity.",
