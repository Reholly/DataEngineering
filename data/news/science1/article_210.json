    "text": "HERMISTON, Ore. -A Hermiston High School student has won the Congressional App Challenge for their app to help diagnose car repairs.\nYahir Conejo-Garcia was notified by the Office of Oregon Senator Cliff Bentz that he is the winner for Oregon's Second District.\n\"Yahir worked extremely hard on this app,” said Hermiston High School Computer Science Teacher Robert Theriault.\nConejo-Garcia's app can be used to narrow down the problems with a car to a specific issue, according to a press release from Hermiston High .\nAfter identifying the problem, the app then instructs the user how to check the issue and further repair it. If the problem requires a part from an auto store, the app can access the user's location via Google maps and direct them to nearby auto parts stores.\n“I remember him trying to decide how to handle all the data he needed for the app,\" said Theriault. \"Since we hadn’t learned a database language yet, he was able to research other methods to store all his data and landed on using JavaScript objects instead. His determination to make the app work is commendable.\"\nThe Congressional App Challenge is held annually to inspire students in STEM, coding and computer science.",
