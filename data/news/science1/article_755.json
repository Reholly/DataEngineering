    "text": "Staring into space during a meeting is often interpreted as a sign of boredom.\nBut American research suggests that getting lost in our thoughts may stimulate the creation of new neural networks in our brains.\nThis could enable us to better absorb information.\nThe authors of this research, published in the journal Nature , came to this conclusion after conducting an experiment involving mice.\nThey monitored and analysed the brain activity of the rodents as they repeatedly looked at two chequerboard images.\nThese were displayed on a screen, which turned grey for a minute between each visual.\nThe researchers found that the mice’s neurons emitted a specific electrical signal when they looked at each of the two images.\nThese signals were specific enough for the scientists to differentiate between the two visuals.\nThis enabled them to discover that when the rodents stared at the grey screen, their neural activity was similar, but not identical, to that recorded when they looked at one of the two images.\nIn other words, they seemed to be daydreaming about the visual.\nThese daydreams occurred only when the mice were relaxed, and more so at the start of the day than in the evening, when the rodents had seen the images dozens of times.\nThe academics noted that these moments of mental evasion appeared to play an important role in the mice’s memorisation of each of the two visuals.\n“When you see two different images many times, it becomes important to discriminate between them.\n“Our findings suggest that daydreaming may guide this process by steering the neural patterns associated with the two images away from each other,” study co-author and Harvard University neuroscience graduate student researcher Nghia Nguyen told the university’s news website The Harvard Gazette .\nInterestingly, the mice were more able to differentiate between the two chequerboard images when their minds were allowed to wander, leading Nguyen and colleagues to suggest that daydreaming has an impact on brain plasticity.\nMore scientific research is needed, however, to prove this causal relationship with any certainty.\nIn any case, the researchers think it’s important to take mental breaks from time to time.\n“We feel pretty confident that if you never give yourself any awake downtime, you’re not going to have as many of these daydream events, which may be important for brain plasticity,” said senior author and Harvard University professor of medicine Dr Mark Andermann.\nSo, hopefully you’ll feel less guilty next time you find yourself daydreaming in a meeting. – AFP Relaxnews\nOpen Modal ×",
