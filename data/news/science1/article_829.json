    "text": "Cheaper Galaxy S24 Prices Could Spell Trouble For Samsung's Rivals [ Jade Bryan Junior Editor ](/user/7734655/jade-bryan) As 2023 comes to a close, it appears that leaks about the [Galaxy S24](https://www.nextpit.com/samsung-galaxy-s24-release-date-price-specs-when-can-you-buy) continue to appear more frequently. After we learned the [full specifications of the trio](https://www.nextpit.com/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-better-gaming-large-vapor-chamber-cooling), two new rumors from separate sources shed more light on the pricing strategy of Samsung, at least in the majority of Europe. Right now, it's unclear whether this will dictate the prices in other regions, including the US. Firstly, Galaxy Club cited its sources that the vanilla Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S24+ will be cheaper than their predecessors. Both base models of the two are said to be €50 cheaper. In particularly, the smaller Galaxy S24 is set to retail for €899 ($995) while the Plus will go for €1,149 ($1,270). Do take note that these alleged price leaks are for the Europe region, hence the currency denomination. If luck is on our side, this is great news for fans, especially that there are rumors of the Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S24+ getting [bigger starting storage and RAM](https://www.nextpit.com/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-ultra-memory-storage-ram-amount-how-much) in some markets. However, bear in mind that prices in other European countries may vary. As for the [high-end Galaxy S24 Ultra](https://www.nextpit.com/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-natural-camera-image-processing-pixel), the outlet suggested it will be a tad pricier with a price tag of €1,449 ($1,600!!!). Notably, this is a €50 increase from the Galaxy S23 Ultra. Before your eyes pop out further, the higher cost could be offset by a larger memory configuration. It was speculated earlier that the [upcoming premium smartphone](https://www.nextpit.com/best-phones) will sport a 12 GB RAM and 256 GB internal storage configuration in its base model. There is no word whether the European prices indicate the cost of the Galaxy S24 outside the region though. Earlier this month, a South Korean publication reported that the [Galaxy S24's prices will remain unchanged](https://www.nextpit.com/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-ultra-final-pric-no-change-upgrade-memory) from the Galaxy S23. It was assumed that this concerned the US, which would place the Galaxy S24 at $799, Galaxy S24+ at $999, and Galaxy S24 Ultra at $1,199, before relevant taxes are applied. With what is coming up, the Galaxy S24 may undercut many of the alternatives from its competitors. For example, the Pixel 8 and [Pixel 8 Pro (review)](https://www.nextpit.com/google-pixel-8-pro-review) have become more expensive than the Pixel 7 duo. The same applies for [Apple's iPhone 15 Pro Max (review)](https://www.nextpit.com/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-review), although it now offers double the storage. Fortunately, we don't need to wait longer to confirm these prices. Samsung is expected to announce the Galaxy S24 on January 17 in San Jose, California, which would be around three weeks from now.
