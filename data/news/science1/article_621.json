    "text": "CLEVELAND — “It's really about giving people a dynamic experience,” according to Chief Science Officer, Gavin Svenson at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History. There are many signs of change these days at the [Cleveland Museum of Natural History](https://www.cmnh.org/), including one encouraging visitors to “please touch.” As you explore, you’ll find volunteers ready to answer questions about fossils, rocks and minerals, that you get to examine. These are conversations the museum hopes to foster. “The new exhibits are really about interactivity, about how you ask and answer questions in science,” said Svenson. Museum staff participate in Scientists Unleased, bringing the information to a captive audience of visitors. “Science is really for everybody. It should be fun, and it should be interactive, and it should be authentic,” said Svenson. “So, putting our own scientists in the gallery space and our current science display, it really enables these authentic conversations to take place.” If exploring the wild side is more your thing, the museum has that too. “I personally do a daily animal encounter where I bring out one of our awesome animal ambassadors for you,” said Josh Avsec, a Wildlife Educator and Guest Engagement Ambassador at the museum. A screech owl named Professor, is getting her time in the spotlight. The museum has over 100 animal ambassadors, all from Ohio and all of them rescues. “Everybody loves them, and with so many animals, we have a lot of variety, and it gets to show off a lot of the different reasons as to why an animal might need to be rescued,” said Avsec. A natural history is about nature. And Cleveland’s new design incorporates this theme into the space. The new exhibit hall opening next year will carry this them too, while sparking your curiosity. “People can interact with the new technology, they can interact with real scientists, they can interact with specimens that are not on exhibit, and they can interact with the specimens that are on exhibit,” said Svenson. And if you want to take the kids while they are on break, the Museum is open Tuesday through Sunday from 10am to 5pm. They are closed New Year’s Day.",
