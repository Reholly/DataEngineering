Creating A Thriving Oasis for Tropical Marine LifeAquarium Crunch recommends designing an aquarium that mimics the natural habitat of tropical marine life, with a focus on substrate, decor, and other design elements that promote diversity and health. A key aspect is selecting the right inhabitants for the aquarium. The guide emphasizes the importance of choosing fish and invertebrates that not only coexist peacefully but also contribute to the ecological health of the mini-reef. You can consider small, peaceful fish, like gobies and blennies.
