    "text": "Journal of Receptors and Signal Transduction, 2023 (SCI-Expanded) Cerebrolysin, an endogenous peptide with neuroprotective and neurotrophic properties, indicated to be beneficial on diabetic neuropathy by preliminary clinical and experimental studies but without evidence on central or peripheral action. Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, based on involvement of pain sensation in both health and disease as first relay centers for transmission and processing of peripheral nociceptive sensory signals, was used to investigate possible effects of Cerebrolysin on high glucose-induced neuropathy, as model. DRG’s were obtained from adult rats and the isolated neurons were seeded on E-Plate®’s equipped with gold microelectrodes, and incubated in culture media in a CO2 incubator at 37 C. DRGs were exposed to high glucose (50 mM) in the absence and presence of different concentrations of Cerebrolysin ® (2–40 mg/ml). Cell index (derived from cell viability and neurite outgrowth) was recorded with Real-Time Cell Analyzer and was used as primary outcome measure. High glucose-induced cellular neuropathy and neuroprotective effects of Cerebrolysin was evaluated from area under the curve (AUC) of cell index-time graphs. Exposure of DRG neurons to high glucose caused a rapid and persistent decrease in the mean AUC values compared to normoglycemic controls. Co-treatment with Cerebrolysin (40 mg/ml) attenuated this high glucose-induced effect in a concentration-dependent manner. In normoglycemic conditions, treatment with Cerebrolysin caused a dose-dependent increase in the mean AUC values. Cerebrolysin treatment resulted in maintenance of the functional integrity, survival, and promotion of neurite outgrowth of the cultured DRG neurons exposed to high glucose, indicating involvement of peripheral sensory neurons.",
