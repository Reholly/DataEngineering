    "text": "Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Most people are probably familiar with the best smartwatches as well as many of the best fitness trackers overall, but there’s another, less intrusive way of tracking your health and fitness metrics: a smart ring. A smart ring can add to both your health routine and your wardrobe, making it a great piece of tech to consider. In shopping for a smart ring you’ll need to consider some things like what kind of activities you want to track, as well durability and connectivity. In order to lighten the load, we’ve rounded up all of the best smart rings for health and sleep tracking. Whether you prefer a smart ring for style or for function, we’ve likely found the best smart ring for you.\nContents The best smart rings for health and sleep tracking How to choose a smart ring How we chose these smart rings Oura Ring 3 Heritage Ultrahuman Ring Air Amovan Smart Ring Oura Ring 3 Horizon WeiQiuOutdr Smart Ring Show 3 more items The best smart rings for health and sleep tracking Best smart ring overall — Best smart ring for features — Best rugged smart ring — Best premium smart ring — Best smart ring for social media — How to choose a smart ring Smart rings aren’t as well known as smart watches and other wearables when it comes to tracking health and fitness metrics, so you won’t be alone if you don’t know where to start when shopping for one. Like all tech, the first thing you need to ask yourself is what you want to use the smart ring for. Are you a runner? Are you trying to lose a little weight? Do you simply want to look good with a new wearable? All of these are important questions to ask yourself as you start to set your eyes on some of the best smart rings available.\nTracking features And those questions will come in handy when it comes to the tracking features a smart ring is made to handle. Many smart rings are capable of tracking both fitness metrics and sleep data. Some are even capable of doing things larger devices like smartwatches can handle. This is where you’ll want to know your needs most of all, so you can pair your fitness tracking needs with the fitness tracking capabilities of a certain smart ring. If you’re a runner you don’t want to come home with a smart ring without run tracking, and if you’re trying to better your sleep patterns you don’t want to hit the hay with a smart ring that isn’t paying attention to you.\nRelated Best Father’s Day Apple Watch Deals 2020: Series 3 and Series 5 Durability Durability is something you always want to consider with a piece of tech that’s meant for fitness tracking. This is especially true if you do most of your activity in the gym. Also included in this category is battery life. You’ll want to ensure your new smart ring can hold a charge long enough to get you through the day and all of your daily activity, and if you’re planning on it doing your sleep tracking you’ll want to find something that can last through the night as well.\nHow we chose these smart rings We’ve had our eye on tech for a long time, and with that comes some across-the-board knowledge we can apply to almost any piece of tech. This is the case when it comes to smart rings, as there is a lot of crossover from devices like smartwatches, fitness trackers, and even the best phones . In addition, we’ve been longtime consumers of tech as well. When choosing the best smart rings for health and fitness tracking we put ourselves in the shoes of the consumer and filter our expertise through that lens. What we’re left with is five of the best smart rings on the market and five smart rings we’re confident recommending.\nOura Ring 3 Heritage Best smart ring overall Oura Ring Pros Cons Feature-packed Inconsistent sizing Super stylish Long battery life The third generation Oura Ring lineup includes the Horizon (which you’ll also find amongst our selections) and the Oura Ring 3 Heritage. We think the Heritage is worthy of the Best Smart Ring Overall title due to its balance of capabilities and price point. It’s capable of tracking blood oxygen, hours slept, resting heart rate, skin temperature, and even your daily step count, and it’s compatible with both Apple iOS and Android. It even has access to more than 50 audio meditations. Apple users may especially love the Oura Ring 3 Heritage, as both the iPhone and Apple Watch lineups are capable of displaying Oura data with widgets.\nSpecifications Operating System Compatibility iOS, Android Water Resistance Up to 100 meters Battery Life Up to 7 days\nUltrahuman Ring Air Best smart ring for smart features Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Pros Cons Feature-packed Average build quality Super stylish Long battery life The Ultrahuman Ring Air is the smart ring for you if you’re looking to dive deep with features and data. It has a dedicated workout mode that tracks various activities, and by tracking heart rate during workouts it can provide insights into cardiovascular response, workout intensity levels, and decisions you need to make to improve your workouts. It’s also able to break down your day into times in which stimulants like caffeine may be beneficial to enhance your productivity. And while the Ultrahuman Ring Air can take care of things like tracking heart rate, skin temperature, and sleep patterns, one of its more unique features is Circadian Phase Alignment, which can help you improve your sleep-wake cycle for improved cognitive function, energy levels, and hormone balance.\nSpecifications Water Resistance Up to 100 meters Battery Life Up to 6 days\nAmovan Smart Ring Best rugged smart ring Amovan Pros Cons Super durable Amovan app is average at best Automatic sleep tracking Great build quality If you get your daily activity in the gym or out on the trails, durability is likely going to be a top concern for you. The Amovan Smart Ring doesn’t come with a lot of frills, and its simplicity allows it to check in with some toughness. It’s crafted from lightweight, high-strength titanium, ensuring excellent workmanship and durability. It’s compatible with both Apple iOS and Android operating systems, and while it can keep up with most smart rings in terms of helping with sleep quality and general fitness tracking, it considers itself tough enough to ride along on any fitness activity.\nSpecifications Operating System Compatibility Apple iOS, Android Water Resistance Up to 100 meters Build Materials High-strength titanium\nOura Ring 3 Horizon Best premium smart ring Pros Cons Feature-packed May go best with Apple devices Super stylish Long battery life If you’re looking to go all-in on a smart ring and budget is no matter to you, the Oura Ring 3 Horizon is the best smart ring for you. Oura has led the smart ring market for years, and its expertise makes the Horizon smart ring well worth its price point. It provides 24/7 heart rate tracking, a daily activity score, a daily readiness score, and the primary tracking features you’ll find in most smart rings. But it will also help you set activity goals and provide bedtime guidance, and it even knows when you need to spend some time off from training to let your body rest and recover. It’s compatible with both iOS and Android, with many of the features best put to use with Apple devices.\nSpecifications Operating System Compatibility Apple iOS, Android Water Resistance Up to 100 meters Battery Life Up to 7 days\nWeiQiuOutdr Smart Ring Best smart ring for social media WeiQiuOutdr Pros Cons Fun alternative features No fitness tracking Affordable Works with smartphone cameras One of the more niche smart rings available is the WeiQiuOutdr Smart Ring. It doesn’t have the tracking features you’ll find in most smart rings, but instead is equipped with features for both consuming and creating content online. The WeiQiuOutdr Smart Ring is geared for scrolling through content on top social media apps like TikTok, and it can even turn pages of eBooks and control music playback on a connected device. It can also work as a smartphone camera remote, which can come in handy for vlogging your fitness routines. This may not be the best smart ring for actually getting your workout in, but it’s something to consider if you get a lot of your fitness advice and guidance online, or if you’re a fitness instructor with an online presence.\nSpecifications Operating System Compatibility Apple iOS, Android Water Resistance None\nThis article is managed and created separately from the Digital Trends Editorial team.\nEditors' Recommendations Razer Anzu smart glasses deal knocks $140 off the price tag",
