    "text": "Daring Academy Alpha 0.1.0 is coming on January 1st, 2024!\nHere it is, the version you've all been waiting for.\nDaring Academy Alpha 0.1.0 is divided into two versions: Original Version and Chapter 1 Demo.\nDifferences on the Chapter 1 Demo:\n- It's available on Steam Itch.io and Gamejolt for free, even when the main game is done (0.1.0 to 1.0.0 will only be available on Itch.io)\n- Achievements are removed, due to an issue on Steam's end\n- Backgrounds in UIs are changed to the apartment, indicating the moving in of the main character and Amelia\n- Anything regarding the full game has been changed to mention the demo, that includes logos, version numbers, etc\nWe strongly recommend you play the Chapter 1 Demo to get a feel of the game, as if you plan on getting all achievements in the game, saves from the Chapter 1 Demo won't give the achievements from Chapter 1 upon playing Chapter 2 and onward, due to issues with Steam demos and all.\nNote: As with any alphas, there are a ton of internal code changes and file reorganizations, so saves might not be compatible between the old versions. Alpha 0.1.0 and onwards will try to keep as much support with Chapter 1 saves as possible, but may become incompatible in future updates, so beware.\nFor Steam Deck Users: While playtesting the game on Steam Deck, we encountered an issue in Desktop Mode where the keyboard wouldn't show up if it the game was in fullscreen mode, even when pressing Steam+X. If this issue appears to you, please connect a keyboard to your device. The keyboard works fully in gaming mode though.\nIf you have Decky Loader on your Steam Deck, you can change the artworks of the Chapter 1 demo build using SteamGridDB plugin. See the\nofficial GitHub for SteamGridDB to learn how.\nA massive thanks to Imbion, Jenivere, Kalosmuffins, Kit from \"Kit\\'s Workshop\", K0maru, RedRan6er, Wavi, LemonadeMochi, Dark_Green, Carter Vandenberg, UnlishedTen8, optimistic1236, SelLillianna, spottyboi, Jayne/Koriko, Twotoneinc, TimberRaven, bikifrench, chlodiami, Alexei, genderlurker, angelicangela., kortniblini, aksanaip, alainax, bdkcisme, jankbithle, Jaydon (A), Gauncamole, Fabryn, Hallowuette, ayinsis and everyone I missed for playtesting throughout 0.0.1 to 0.1.0's development phase. This demo wouldn't be possible without all of you.\nYou can download and play 0.0.1, known as the Legacy Edition to see all the progress in 3 years of development. This edition of 0.0.1 doesn't change the story from said version but adds smaller things like a smaller cursor, Discord rich presence support, etc. Go to\nhttps://thediamondcryst.itch.io/daring-academy-chapter-1-demo or select the Legacy branch in the Steam build settings to play it. Note: Any issues in this version will not be fixed. Saves in that version of the game are also not compatible with the Chapter 1 Demo, 0.1.0, or the full game.\nAs a final thank you, thanks to Dandelier for making the image in the header perfectly representing Chapter 1.
