Every day, we hear something new about Samsung's next flagships, and at this point, the only thing missing is official pricing, as practically everything has leaked. New Leak Reveals All Three Samsung Galaxy S24 Variants And Their Specs A big Galaxy S24 leak has exposed everything, including specs and renderings. Today, a fresh spec sheet has surfaced that gives further light on the new phones, specifically the cameras, screens, and processors that Samsung is opting for.
