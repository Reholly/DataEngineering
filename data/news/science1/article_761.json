Most people want a clean house, but they also want to get through the task of tidying it as quickly and efficiently as possible. That not only means knowing all the best cleaning hacks that cut your scrubbing time in half, but also having all of your cleaning tools and supplies an arm's reach away. Having them handy cuts down on the time you have to run to and from your cleaning cupboard or closet, saving you time and energy. And one great way to have these items near you at all times is to wear a cleaning apron.\nA cleaning apron is exactly as it sounds: It's an apron that ties around your waist and is outfitted with a series of practical pockets. These pockets vary in shape, size, and purpose. Some are big enough to house spray bottles, others have loops so you can hang tools like Swiffer Dusters from them, and others are compact so you can pocket things like sponges or cell phones. Here is why you should try out this cleaning accessory to make chore day all the more convenient.\nWhy you should try a cleaning apron\nAmazon\nThe cleaning apron is essentially like a cleaning cart, except it's strapped to your person. Lots of people like to use the rolling cart hack to make their chores easier to perform, where they pack a rolling cart full of their cleaning essentials and wheel it from room to room. This negates the need to run to your cupboard every time you need a different cleaning spray or vacuum attachment. However, while convenient, it's not a great option if you have multiple floors to clean, since that would require you to carry a heavy cart up and down stairs. The cleaning apron helps to fix that.\nThe apron can also be comparable to a handheld cleaning caddy , which is a small bucket with compartments that can hold a couple of different cleaning products, sponges, and small tools you may need. While that's much easier to carry up and down the stairs, it's not glued to you like the apron, which means you still need to walk back and forth to get what you need. For ultimate convenience, use the apron to grab what you require the second you need it. Curious? Here is where to buy one.\nCleaning apron options\nWalmart\nYou can get a cleaning apron at major realtors such as Amazon and Walmart. For example, on Amazon , you can try out the LoDrid Professional Cleaning Apron for $20. It's made from water-resistant nylon, so it won't stain or saturate if some cleaning spray leaks onto it, and it has nine different pockets to house your supplies and tools. You can fit anything from garbage bags to rubber gloves in those pockets. Similarly, there is a comparable cleaning apron at Walmart . Dubbed the MLfire 600D Oxford Cloth Cleaning Apron, it retails for an affordable $12, is made from a water-resistant material, and has two rows of pockets that can hold cleaning essentials.\nWhile there are a lot of pros to this cleaning helper, there are also a few downsides that you should consider. First, it might get annoying having bulky bottles and cans hang off of you if you're trying to clean the tub or handwash the floor. That's because they can get in your way or potentially fall out when bent over. You might have to remove the apron to do those tasks. Secondly, you can't hang every possible cleaning product and tool you might need in those pockets, so you might have to venture back to your cupboard to swap out your supplies. While it might not tick every convenience you might need, it can still help you make fast work of your chores. It all depends on your own preferences and how you clean!",
