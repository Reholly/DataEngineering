    "text": "Once again Twitch Drops are returning for Escape From Tarkov to celebrate the new wipe , giving you the chance to get some free loot just for watching Tarkov streamers on Twitch. The drops start on December 29 and end on January 8, but before you can start to claim your in-game items, there are a few steps you will need to go through first.\nThe fact you are reading this probably suggests you are already an Escape From Tarkov player, but if not you will need to make an Escape From Tarkov account and purchase the game. Fortunately for you, it's currently 25% off for the next week or so.\nOnce you have your copy of Tarkov and have installed the game and created your character, you will then need to go to the Escape From Tarkov website to link your Twitch account with your Tarkov account. It's a simple process that only takes a few clicks.\nNow you have everything in place to earn you Twitch drops for Escape From Tarkov , all you need to do is head to an eligible stream and watch. As you watch you will earn progress to your first drop and will be notified on Twitch when you unlock it. You then need to go to the inventory page to claim the drop. Once you claim the drop it will be sent to your Tarkov game.\nTo unblock your drop in Tarkov you will need to head to your messages where you should have a new message that has items attached to it. These are your Twitch drops and they can be transferred to your stash just like any other quest reward or insurance return.\nForbes Vetted For You The Best Gaming Laptops Under $1,000: Boost Your Games For Less By Jon Martindale Contributor Which Escape From Tarkov Streams Have Twitch Drops? Anyone who is streaming Escape From Tarkov is eligible to give away drops, so you can pretty much choose your favorite streamer and not have to worry about it. However, this is only the case for the first day of drops on December 29 and the last day on January 7.\nOutside of these dates, there are specific streamers who will have drops on different days. The full list is massive, so you will need to search to find out when your favorite streamers have drops. Everyone on this list will have drops on December 29 and January 7, as well as two other drops streams for 12 hours on a specific day.\nIf you want to stream Tarkov and give away drops, you will have to do so on December 29 or January 7, as the list of eligible streamers between those dates will not be updated.\nIf you are on the lookout for more free loot, you can still claim the free new years gift .\nMike Stubbs",
