    "text": "[Forbidden](/tag/forbidden) recently reunited for the first time since 2012 with the lineup of classic guitarist Craig Locicero and bassist Matt Camacho, alongside guitarist Steve Smyth (ex- [Testament](/tag/testament), ex- [Nevermore](/tag/nevermore)), drummer Chris Kontos (ex- [Machine Head](/tag/machine-head)), and vocalist Norman Skinner.\nAs the reunion shows roll in, Locicero said in a recent interview with\nBlabbermouth that new material is definitely coming. Locicero notes that the new stuff won't be like [Forbidden](/tag/forbidden)'s 1988 debut album Forbidden Evil, but somewhere between everything else they accomplished during their career.\n\"Forbidden Evil is an anomaly. We didn't think about it too much. I think I can land on point when I say this: It's going to be somewhere between Twisted Into Form and Omega Wave. I'm leaning into those Twisted Into Form arrangements and most of what I've been writing is in E [guitar tuning]. I'm also going to have songs that drop down [in tuning], like Omega Wave and possibly lower.\n\"I want this album to have peaks and valleys and an emotional landscape that you can follow. It has to feel like a story, even though it's not going to be a concept album. It has to be on vinyl. It has to come out on all the formats and the digital bullshit. It has to be everything that made records great. It's going to be all the shit I never got to do.\n\"I feel really confident about it. I've started writing a bunch of stuff. I've got more riffs than these guys have caught onto because we keep doing shows. I hope to have it recorded by this time next year to have it ready in the first half of 2025.\"\nIn the meantime, you can check out the reunited\n[Forbidden](/tag/forbidden) playing \"Twisted Into Form\" at Alcatraz 2023 below. It's killer.",
