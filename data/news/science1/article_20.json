    "text": "MID-MICHIGAN (WJRT) - December 2023 will go down in the history books as among the warmest months of December on record. With a few more days left in the month, both the Flint and Saginaw areas are recording the second warmest month of December on record. Only December 2015 was warmer in both areas. Temperature records from the National Weather Service go back to 1912 in Saginaw and 1921 in Flint. Over the past four weeks, temperatures in Flint have averaged more than 10 degrees above normal. The Saginaw area has seen temperatures 9 degrees warmer than normal. The weather forecast for the final three days of December 2023 shows a continuation of warmer than average temperatures across Mid-Michigan. High temperatures in the region should reach the low 40s on Friday and near 40 on Saturday before dropping slightly into the upper 30s for Sunday. Average temperatures for late December in Flint and Saginaw are 32 degrees. A clipper system on Saturday may bring some light snow showers, but accumulations will be minor. The snow could present some challenges on the roads for New Year's Eve parties, however.",
