This unlocks the potential for powerful runewords, making your gear top-notch. In this guide, we’ll walk you through the two methods of adding sockets to items in Diablo 2 Resurrected. Plus, discover the advantage of buying [Diablo 2 Resurrected Runes](https://www.rpgstash.com/d2r-runes/) at RPGStash.com to boost your gaming experience. Adding Sockets: Larzuk Quest in Act V To kick off your socketing journey, complete the “Siege on Harrogath” quest for Larzuk in Act V. Defeat Shenk the Overseer in The Bloody Foothills and return to Larzuk. He’ll grant you the ability to socket an item once per difficulty (Normal, Nightmare, Hell), giving you a total of three socket quests per character. The number of sockets Larzuk adds depends on item rarity and level: – Unique, Set, and Rare items: 1 Socket – Magic items: 1-2 Sockets (random) – White/Grey items: Maximum sockets based on item level Understanding the item level for white and grey items is crucial. The item level is tied to the monster level that drops the item. Refer to the iLvL Socket Chart on DiabloWiki for detailed information. Socketing with Cube Recipes Another way to add sockets is through specific Horadric Cube recipes, applicable to plain white or ethereal items: – Body Armor: Tal Rune + Thul Rune + Perfect Topaz + Normal Armor – Weapon: Ral Rune + Amn Rune + Perfect Amethyst + Normal Weapon – Helm: Ral Rune + Thul Rune + Perfect Sapphire + Normal Helm – Shield: Tal Rune + Amn Rune + Perfect Ruby + Normal Shield For rare items, use 3 Perfect Skulls and a Stone of Jordan to add one socket. Is Socketing Always Worth It? Absolutely! Even with powerful rare items, socketing is worth it. High-level items can receive up to 3 sockets on Normal, 4 on Nightmare, and 6 on Hell difficulty. Socketed normal items serve as an excellent base for runewords, exclusive to this category. Enhance Your Experience with RPGStash.com Looking to fast-track your progress?
