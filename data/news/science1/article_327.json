A good brush is durable, distributes pigment evenly, and blends seamlessly without irritating the skin or causing patchiness. While different brushes are intended for different purposes, there aren't technically any hard and fast rules. The most important thing is to find what works for you and invest in quality brushes — and most of the time, bristle softness is a major indicator of quality.\nAside from feeling luxurious, the softest brushes will also help your makeup to look its best. \"Whether they are natural hair or synthetic, you want something that feels soft to touch against the eyes and face — this will be key to blending,\" says makeup artist and Stila Global Beauty Director Charlie Riddle . \"Any brush that is more coarse will make your makeup look more textured and difficult to blend.\"\nWhen choosing brushes, it's also helpful to consider how often you'll use them. If you typically use makeup brushes daily or travel with them regularly, it is worth it to invest in high-quality ones. \"I always look for quality because I wash them so often,\" says Los Angeles-based makeup artist Tarryn Feldman .\nAdvertisement Our top picks for the best makeup brushes, according to makeup artists: Advertisement The best face brushes Stila Double-Ended Complexion Brush This multitasking tool features a large fluffy brush on one end and a smaller, more precise brush on the other.\nShop at Amazon External link Arrow An arrow icon, indicating this redirects the user.\"\nSpecifics\nBristle type: Synthetic Great for: Powder, light foundation, cream products, concealer, highlighter This multitasking tool features a large fluffy brush on one end and a smaller, more precise brush on the other. \"I love dual ended brushes,\" says Riddle. \"Not only are you getting two for one but this is great for buffing on a light foundation or cream products.

It is one of the most versatile brushes in my kit.\"\nAdvertisement Natural hair versus synthetic brushes Makeup brush bristles are available in three main categories: natural, synthetic, or a blend of the two. If you adhere to a vegan lifestyle, prefer vegan products, or have any allergies to animal hair that's used in natural brushes, you'll want to stick with synthetic brushes. These are typically made from nylon, polyester, and other synthetic fibers.\nBoth natural and synthetic brushes can be beneficial for different reasons. \"Anything natural hair is amazing for blending; eyes, blush, powder.\" Riddle explains. \"Synthetics are great for applying primers, foundations, concealers, contour. I wouldn't say one is better than the other — it really depends on the specific use of the brush.\"\nCatherine Santino Freelance Writer Catherine Santino is a freelance writer who covers beauty, culture, and entertainment.
