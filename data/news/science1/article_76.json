    "text": "2023-12-28 18:45:28\nCell phones have become the most used instruments for verbal communication. They are even the main senders and receivers of written messages. For this reason, virtual tools that improve text writing are very useful for Internet users. One of them is on the lips of many Internet users: it is TypeAI, an application that detects plagiarism and shows users alternative sentences or recommends the use of synonyms. This application is linked to the ChatGPT chatbot, which allows developers to offer users services similar to those of the popular chat, but now integrated into their cell phone.\nYou may be interested: The New York Times sued OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT, for using its articles without permission\nTypeAI integrates with different platforms or phone applications to offer a wide range of functions to assist in text writing and linguistic correction. Among other things, the tool suggests synonyms and alternative phrases. It also allows spell checking in seven languages, eliminating the fear of mistyping a word in another language. And, as if this were not enough, TypeAI immediately translates messages received or sent in another language.\nAll these tools arise in the context of the appearance of ChatGPT. This chatbot is a language model developed by OpenAI, based on GPT engineering. Its launch to the public marked an important moment in the history of Artificial Intelligence.\n#ChatGPT #corrects #spelling #text #messages #offers #translations #languages",
