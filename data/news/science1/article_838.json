Here are some illnesses, diseases, and problems associated with springtime and treatments and preventions to keep your flock healthy when springtime has sprung.\nAvian Influenza\nRecently the avian influenza virus (H5N1) has approached record numbers in wild bird populations and in poultry operations. The virus can live forever in frozen material and for long periods at moderate temperatures – making springtime a season to take extra safeguards. The virus can be spread through contained shoes, clothing, equipment and through insects and rodents. It also spreads directly from bird-to-bird contact.\nSymptoms include sudden death without any prior symptoms, lack of energy and appetite, a drop in egg production, swelling of the eyelids, comb wattles and shanks, gasping for air, nasal discharge, twisting of the head and neck, stumbling or falling and diarrhea. If you witness these symptoms report them to your local veterinarian, agricultural extension office or state veterinarian.\nTake biosecurity measures to protect your flock, especially as we enter spring and wild birds begin migrating. Disinfecting clothing, including shoes, hands, and equipment is essential. Spring is a busy poultry show season for many of us. Isolating birds returning from shows and fairs for 30 days is recommended. Reducing the amount of visitors on your property is also advised. If visitors are necessary (e.g., veterinarians, service provides etc.), set up a washing procedure for hands, boots, and their equipment in and out of your operation. Secure feed bins and waters to prevent wildlife (wild birds and rodents) contamination.\nEgg-bound Chickens\nAs we approach spring and day length increases, many of our birds will start to lay again. Ensure that they are receiving proper nutrition to avoid egg laying problems. Hens deficient in calcium may become egg-bound or lay misshapen eggs. If you see a hen straining or spending extra time in the nest box, feel and inspect the vent to see if you can detect the egg. If you can, apply a lubricant – like vegetable oil – and massage the area. We have had success with placing the hen in a warm bath for 15 to 20 minutes, which can relax the muscles and allow the egg to pass. If the egg breaks internally, the hen will likely get an infection and a veterinarian should be consulted. Egg-binding occurs more often in older hens.\nEgg Drop Syndrome\nAnother egg related disease is known as “egg drop”, “egg drop syndrome 76”, or “EDS-72.” The disease was first seen in ducks and geese, and it can affect all breeds of chickens, in particular brown-egg layers and broiler breeds. Infected birds will appear to be healthy but will lay thin-shelled or shell-less eggs. Although no successful treatment exists, inducing molting will reestablish healthy egg production.\nInfectious Coryza\nSeen in chickens, pheasants, and guinea fowl, coryza is transmitted primarily by direct bird-to-bird contact. Exposure risk is increased at poultry shows, bird swaps and fairs. Healthy-looking birds remain carries of the organism and may shed them throughout their lives. Coryza can be spread by airborne respiratory droplets and in contaminated feed and water. Symptoms include facial swelling; foul smelling, thick, sticky nasal and eye discharge; and labored breathing. Biosecurity measures and good sanitation practices are the best ways to avoid infectious coryza. Water-soluble antibiotics can be used, but consult a veterinarian as some aren’t FDA-approved for pullets.\nOmphalitis\nOmphalitis, also known as “navel ill” or “mushy chick disease,” is an infection that occurs during hatching or before the chick’s navel is healed.\nOmphalitis only affects chickens, and comes from dirty hatching eggs, eggs\nwith poor-quality shells, contaminated eggs exploding in the hatch area, or\ndirty brooders. Signs include dehydration; edema in the chick’s ventral area; external navel infections; and large, unabsorbed yolk sacs. There is no specific treatment for omphalitis and most affected birds die within a few days. To prevent omphalitis, clean the hatching areas (nest boxes and incubators).\nStaphylococcus\nStaphylococcus aureus is a soilborne infection that often is seen after storms and periods of wet weather when birds are drinking from stagnant rain pools. The infections come in three stages: acute, chronic, and bumblefoot. Signs of septicemia — the acute form — include pain while moving, lack of appetite, and fever, and signs of the chronic form of Staphylococcus infection.\nBirds are lame and prefer to sit rather than stand. Bumblefoot is thought to be caused by injuries in which the localized chronic Staphylococcus infects the foot.\nNovobiocin, Erythromycin or penicillin can be used as treatments. Consult with your veterinarian on the proper dosage for your flock.\nParasites\nExternal parasites can pose a major problem in poultry as the weather warms. Lice and mites are the most common, but ticks and fleas can cause serious illnesses as well. The transmission of viruses and disease are the main cause of concern, although feather loss, and scratching due to irritation are problematic as well. Shaft, fluff, and wing lice can infect ducks, turkeys and guinea hens if they are housed close to infected chickens. One of the best pieces of knowledge I received was that adult lice rarely leave their host birds and therefore the treatment of the birds’ living quarters is of little value in controlling them. For mites, premise treatments (living quarters) and bird treatments are both important as mites live much of the life off their host.\nApplying approved pesticides is necessary for your birds health, your local ecosystem, and it’s the ethical and lawful thing to do. Visit\nhttps://www.veterinaryentomology.org/vetpestx to find out which pesticide is approved for your region. It includes a dropdown menu for each state, the species you want to treat, the targeted pest and application method.\nPredators\nIn addition to baby poultry, spring time is when many predators like birds of prey, racoons, coyotes, and wolves raise their young. With extra mouths to feed, many predators look for easy meals. Ensure you securely protect your flock to avoid disappointment.\nKENNY COOGAN is a food, farm, and flower national columnist.
