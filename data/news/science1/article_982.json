    "text": "Worldwide, eSports are becoming more and more prominent. Ten years ago, few people would have thought that video gaming would be on par with traditional sports. Now, the world’s most popular sports leagues all have eSports counterparts, from the ePremier League to the NFL’s new Tuesday Night Gaming scheme.\nAnd, beyond the realm of pro sports mashups, eSports have taken off in their own right. Games like League of Legends, PUBG,\nand Fortnite have tens of millions of active players. The top echelon of competitors represents established teams and makes hundreds of thousands of dollars. Most are now battling it out in regional leagues before advancing to global championships—something that sports fans would dream of seeing.\nFor gamers, this type of glory is more accessible than ever before—especially as institutions like universities start to offer eSports-centric programs. But what sorts of things can the average gamer to do improve their chances in competitive gaming? Here are a few tips to help you make the cut.\nOption #1: Join an Open League\nThe easiest way to get started with competitive gaming is to check out the most accessible tournaments. These opportunities are available for just about every type of game, whether an FPS, battle royale, or even a game like poker.\nLet’s cover an example of the latter. A poker player who wants to take their game to the next level might consider joining something like PokerStars’ Power Path. This Power Path is designed to guide players\nas they start their journey toward qualifying for more online and in-person tournaments. So, if you’re looking to level up, seek out guides that lay out how to advance.\nOption #2: Use Online Forums to Build a Team\nPoker players must always go it alone, but that isn’t always the case with other games. In fact, titles like League of Legends involve quite a bit of teamwork. If you’re looking to advance in a multiplayer game, then you first need to find a team.\nOne of the easiest ways to do this is to seek out like-minded players on forums. What do we mean by likeminded? In terms of competitive gaming, that means this player should be interested in gaining new skills, can communicate efficiently, and is at the same skill level as you (or a bit higher).\nOption #3: Join in-Game Guilds\nAnother option to push your gaming skills to new levels is to target a community within the game. Once again, this isn’t always possible. However, if you’re interested in games like World of Warcraft and Elder Scrolls Online, then\njoining an in-game guild or clan can quickly introduce you to new skills and ideas.\nThat’s also true for resources. If you join a clan that includes other advanced players, you might immediately have access to their resources, such as a crafting station in Elder Scrolls. The same is true for loot and difficult missions. In games like World of Warcraft, it’s not uncommon for guild members to split items and armor, and then tackle dangerous quests together.\nOption #4: Show Off Your Skills & Build Your Rep on Twitch\nClearly, there are easy ways to learn from other gamers as you advance toward your goal of becoming an eSports star. But there’s still one big issue—if you want to join a top team, then you need to be recruited. And you can only be recruited if you’re visible.\nFor this reason, many eSports hopefuls have focused on building a following on Twitch (and, sometimes, YouTube). That’s because Twitch and YouTube are the primary spaces where recruiters search for up-and-coming gamers. As gamers build a following, they’re able to showcase their skills to a broader audience.\nSimultaneously, building a following on Twitch or YouTube can also allow gamers to create their own channels. Even if they aren’t recruited, they can potentially earn sponsorship dollars by building up their follower count. Ninja, for example, is one of the most successful gamers in the world—but he’s largely in the entertainment space rather than competitive eSports.",
