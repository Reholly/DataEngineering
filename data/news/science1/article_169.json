    "text": "1. A bottle of\nCOSRX's Snail Mucin Repairing Essence which addresses dullness and dehydration with ‚Äî yes üòå ‚Äî 96% snail sludge that's harvested in a *100%* ethical and environmentally friendly way. Thanks for sharing the goods, friends! üêå\nPromising review: \"I am on my third month of Accutane and have really struggled because I've tried all kinds of moisturizers but it was almost impossible to keep my skin from peeling from dryness. I would recommend applying to clean face and allow it to dry before applying any other products like moisturizer. This product helps repair your skin barrier. I recently got my mom to use this and she loves it too she said it makes her skin look tighter and lowers the appearance of wrinkles.\" ‚Äî\nJaclyn B.\nGet it from Amazon for\n$15.92+ (available in two sizes).\n2. Some\ncallus remover to eliminate the hard skin on your hooves (ahem, :::clears throat::: feet) if you're too terrified to face the glorified cheese grater at your local salon.\nPromising review: \"OMG!! I HAD horrible feet! They were hard and nothing seemed to work until I tried this. I have tried so many different products that I actually thought it was impossible to remove the thick skin. When I saw this product and read some of the reviews... I decided to try it. I put this callus remover on for about 20 minutes (the instructions say 5-10 minutes but my feet were so AWFUL that I decided to double the max recommended time lol)... then I scrubbed them with a\npumice stone. All of the gross hard skin came off... I could not believe it! When I tell you, it felt like I had new feet, I mean that!!\" ‚Äî Sheena\nGet it from Amazon for\n$14.99.\n3. A\nWet & Forget weekly cleaner you can spritz on your shower walls and tub after you're done cleaning yourself. Leave it on overnight ‚Äî no scrubbing necessary ‚Äî and just wash it off the next time you're in the shower!\nPromising review: \"I never write product reviews, but this product was so amazing that I had to. We have hard water making the soap scum build up in our shower impossible to scrub away. I have tried every cleaning product there is and spent hours scrubbing and trying to clean our shower. This product arrived today and I immediately sprayed it on. It set for about 8 hours and then I went to start scrubbing. I barely had to scrub and my shower is spotless!! AMAZING!!\" ‚Äî\nRobyn Smith\nGet it from Amazon for\n$20.98+ (available in two scents and various sizes).\n4. An\nindoor insect trap that can contend with mosquitoes, gnats, moths, and fruit flies because if they're not eating you alive, they're messing with your plants and produce and you won't stand for it!!!!\nPromising review: \"We have had an ongoing issue with drugstore beetles for the past 9 months. Nothing we did resolved it, in spite of thorough cleaning, removal of all possible food sources, and clearing every potential site we could think of for eggs. Getting rid of them seemed almost impossible, as they do not respond to most insecticides, and can survive temperatures below freezing. We were at a loss. This bug catcher has been a massive help. It sucks up any little bug that gets near it. It is quiet, low maintenance, and easy to change when you need a new glue sheet.\" ‚Äî\nTegan A Beechey\nGet it from Amazon for\n$39.99 (available in two colors).\n5. A\nportable car vacuum if your toddler's favorite game is to throw their Cheerios all over the backseat and then grind them into the cushions and floorboards on their way out of the car. üôÉ\nPromising review: \"This item is perfect. As a busy wife and mom it is nearly impossible to keep my vehicle clean. This portable vacuum makes it much easier. It‚Äôs so convenient to have on hand and clean up crumbs 'as they fall' lol. My husband likes it so much that he ordered one for his vehicle.\" ‚Äî\nChristian Love\nGet it from Amazon for\n$29.99+ (available in three colors/configurations).\n6. A tub of\nThe Pink Stuff that can clean anything you throw at it be that tires, pots and pans, stove tops, showers, or the sticky White Claw patch in your kitchen.\nCheck it out on TikTok\nhere!\nAnd here's what BuzzFeeder/The Pink Stuff fan\nHeather Braga has to say:\n\"After hearing what incredible things The Pink Stuff can do, I finally ordered it and tried it for myself. Honestly, wow! It really does work wonders. I tried it first on my Le Creuset cast-iron pan and really was amazed at how just one pass with The Pink Stuff (and a\nscouring brush) took off almost every stain! I can't wait to try it on literally everything in my home that needs a deep cleaning.\"\nPromising review: \"I have an acrylic shower pan with a textured surface that has proven impossible to clean. The Pink Stuff finally did the job with a little elbow grease. This will be a staple in my cleaning products.\" ‚Äî\nBetty Parsons\nGet it from Amazon for\n$4.99.\n7. An\n ~instant~ carpet spot remover you can rely on to get your space back in shape after you accidentally trip while holding a whole bowl of queso. (It happens to the best of us.)\nPromising review: ‚ÄúI have tried many stain removers over the years and this is by far the best one. It has removed stains left behind by other products; stains I really thought were impossible to clean. Have been using this for several years and intend to stick with it. Definitely recommend.\" ‚Äî\nPat H.\nGet it from Amazon for\n$6.65.\n8. A\nwinged eyeliner stamp for those who LOVE the look of winged liner, but can't help but shake like a leaf when attempting to paint them on. Now, you can stamp 'em on and call it a day.\nCheck it out in action on TikTok\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@jadequijano_/video/7040467026170924335!\nPromising review: \"This is the best invention EVER! I have a scar at the corner of my eye that made applying liquid liner impossible because of the uneven surface. This stamp goes right over the scar perfectly and I have perfect winged liner in seconds! Truly amazing. I'll be using this forever!\" ‚Äî\nChristine\nGet a set of two from Amazon for\n$14.97 (available in three styles).\n9. A\npack of K-Cup cleaning pods that are basically like a full-body tune-up for your coffee maker. Just look at the nasty stuff it flushes out!\nPromising review: \"My Keurig had started to sputter and trying to get 10oz out of it was becoming impossible. I was having to run water through it before every cup just to get a full cup. I got these and used them immediately. What a difference!!!! My Keurig is like I just took it out of the box. I cannot recommend these enough.\" ‚Äî\nRoger\nGet a pack of six from Amazon for\n$9.45.\n10. A\nbeard straightener if oils and balms have proven insufficient in your efforts to tame your facial hair. This lil' tool has three heat settings, reaches your desired temp in just 30 seconds, and reduces frizz as it works.\nPromising review: \"My beard hair is coarse and wavy. I have tried\nboar bristle brushes and an ungodly amount of beard balms and oils to get my beard to lay straight. Then along comes this straightener. IT WORKS! Heats up fast, and is very effective. The digital readout makes it easy to choose a precise temperature. Even just one use keeps my beard looking straight for a couple of days. Daily use seems to keep it looking like I had a barber trim every day. I used to stop my beard from growing beyond a certain length because it would curl up and was impossible to get the look that I wanted. Now my beard looks exactly as I always wanted it to.\" ‚Äî Keerthan Krishnan\nGet it from Amazon for\n$23.65+ (available in two models).\n11. A\nChomChom roller ‚Äî a MUST for any pet parent ‚Äî ready to put your regular old lint roller to shame. Forget ripping off sheets till you run out ‚Äî this collects everything in a neat little compartment you simply empty out.\nHere's what BuzzFeeder\nJenae Sitzes has to say:\n\"I've been using the ChomChom for quite a while now, but I took the photos above literally just now to show just how quick, easy, and effective this roller is. It took 10 seconds to rid my velvet couch ottoman (yes, velvet...a terrible cat owner choice, I know) of the hair my two gray kitties are constantly leaving everywhere. It takes a bit of practice to get the hang of using this roller ‚Äî at first, I thought you only brushed down in one direction, and was confused why it wasn't picking up hair. It's important to do a push-and-pull brushing in *both* directions so it actually pulls the hair inside, which does require you to apply a bit of pressure.\"\nPromising review: \"I was skeptical that this would would work. I have two cats and a dog. Cleaning hair off clothing and furniture is near impossible. But this really works. Black pants... fur free. Couch... fur free. It's amazing. Even the cat tower looks clean. Works on the rug, too. I got carried away and de-furred my whole living room. Next is the bedroom.\" ‚Äî\nA Jenkins.\nGet it from Amazon for\n$24.99 (available in three colors).\n12. An\nenzyme-based stain spray capable of taking on the *peskiest* stains from grass and mud to wine and even cosmetics. If you've ever gotten a drop of foundation on your clothes, you know what a big deal that last one is! Puracy is a small, family-owned business dedicated to creating natural and organic formulas that are not only effective but safe for kids and pets. Aside from food stains, this spray also does a number on all other miscellaneous spots in your life like wine, coffee, makeup, and period blood!\nPromising review: \"I was reluctant to purchase a 'natural' stain remover, and I was surprised how great it works on ALL types of stains. My husband is a Greens Keeper on our local golf course. Needless to say, he comes home with a huge variety of nearly impossible-to-get-out stains on his clothes; from grease to grass stains, and everything in between. So, far, I have not had a stain that the Puracy stain remover (applied with a toothbrush) cannot tackle. It beats all the commercial stain removers, and I‚Äôve tried them all. It also removes chocolate, blood, and tomato stains. One of the best cleaning products I‚Äôve used.\" ‚Äî\nDee Marie\nGet it from\nPuracy on Amazon for $7.99+ (available in various sizes and with or without a cleaning cloth).\n13. A\ntube of silicone grout whitener if you're dealing with mold and mildew that will. not. go. away. no matter how much you clean it.\nThe gel formula is safe to use on/around windows, sinks and baths, shower-heads, pools, tiles, silicone sealant, and more. Leave it on the area you're looking to clean for six to eight hours (no scrubbing required). Some reviewers with really bad mold/mildew note that leaving it on for longer and/or doing a second round of cleaning made a huge difference!\nPromising review: \"We bought this as a last ditch effort to clean a shower that seemed impossible to clean. We were seriously on the verge of just remodeling the bathroom to fix the problem. But this little bottle cleaned up every nook and cranny that we thought were done for. So very impressed, and we will be ordering more!\" ‚Äî\nAlex Hawman\nGet it from Amazon for\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B076KS1VYQ?tag=bfchelsea-20&ascsubtag=7577674%2C13%2C38%2Cmobile_web%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%3A0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0.\n14. An\nAngry Mama microwave cleaner that, once filled with water and a dash of vinegar, will steam clean the grimiest of appliances. Hot Pocket grease, butter splatters, and burnt popcorn smells are no match for her.\nPromising review: \"The Angry Mama did the impossible. I used it to clean an impossibly dirty, caked, hasn't-been-cleaned-for-years work microwave. Even though I had trouble taking it apart and putting it together during the first use, this lil' Mama did her job to a T. Years of hardened and re-microwaved gunk released their foul grasp from the walls of the microwave and were wiped clean. The microwave looks almost new. I couldn't believe it.\" ‚Äî\nChelsie Sanchez\nGet it from Amazon for\n$6.99+ (available in different sizes and packs of one or two).\n15. A\nfull-body bath pillow so you can roll off of your regular mattress and onto your submerged mattress.\nPromising review: \"I love this thing so much. I have a standard tub/shower that is impossible to be comfortable in. This mat made my bath usable again! The quality of this thing is great and it has a little loop for easy hanging. I now I have to set a timer to remind myself to get out the bath. I could sleep in it now.\" ‚Äî\nAutumn White\nGet it from Amazon for\n$47.02+ (available in two styles and colors).\n16. A\nfoot peeling mask that's SO effective, the before and after photos will both give you nightmares and earn a spot on your vision board.\nIf\nfoot graters give you the heebie-jeebies (hi, hello, it's me!), try these instead. Just slip on the booties for one hour, wash away the leftover solution, and then wait patiently as it takes 7‚Äì14 days before your feet shed like a freakin' iguana. At the end, you'll be left with moisturized, baby-soft tootsies!\nPromising review: \"I have tried other foot peels but the completeness of this peel is gratifying! Results started in three days and at 10 days, it is nearly done. My husband did the mask the same day ‚Äî I thought his heels were impossible, but the callouses keep peeling more each day!\" ‚Äî\nConnie Schmidt\nGet it from Amazon for\n $12.99+ (available in five scents).\n17. Some\n Bissell Stomp 'N Go pads capable of lifting whatever nasty stain your pet left you on your new area rug. Whether you're picking up slobber, mud, or an \"accident\" (let's be real ‚Äî it was just raining and they didn't want to go outside) your fingers don't have to get anywhere near the mess ‚Äî just throw on a house show, toss the pad on top of the stain, and give it a good ol' stomp.\nPromising review: \"I am FURIOUS at how great these things worked. FUMING. What sorcery is this? What kind of magic was cast? What spell was spoken? How...how do these things DO THIS. Now I have to cover my whole house! This... was impossible to remove prior. Every üëèüèªSingleüëèüèªCleanerüëèüèªHasüëèüèªBeenüëèüèªTriedüëèüèª Then these little babies‚Ä¶they come in and swoop up every ounce of elbow grease and every tear I have poured into these SPOTS. IN SECONDS. Son of a..there goes my life savings. Everyone..put your stocks into Bissell..\" ‚Äî\nKathy Prentkowski\nGet a pack of 20 from Amazon for\n$27.49.\n18. An\nAngry Orange pet odor eliminator if you precious wittle baby is literally PERFECT except for the fact that they treat your area rug like a pee pad.\nPromising review: \"This is very powerful which I love because trying to get rid of the smell of cat urine is nearly impossible. The scent is pleasing and the product does a good job of getting rid of stains also. A little goes a long way, so I don't use too much ‚Äî just two or three sprays and it's enough to cover the area. Plus, it deters my cat from spraying on furniture and I haven't had any problems since.\" ‚Äî\nAmazon Customer\nGet it from Amazon for\n$19.97.\n19. A\nConair fabric defuzzer powerful enough to remove pills and matted fibers from your sofa (and even clothes) but gentle enough that no damage is left in its wake.\nThe battery-operated model requires two AA batteries that aren't included, but you can buy some right\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MNV8E0C?tag=bfchelsea-20&ascsubtag=7577674%2C19%2C38%2Cmobile_web%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%3A0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0!\nPromising review: \"I don't know how I lived without this fabric defuzzer all my life! It is fast and leaves clean fabric. I have a hoodie that came out of the wash full of pilling a couple of washes ago. It is my favorite hoodie, because it was my son's senior hoodie, and I lost him eight months ago without warning. Picking the pilling off was an impossible task but this Conair fabric defuzzer had it spotless in about five minutes.\" ‚Äî\nLeslie J. Holker\nGet it from Amazon for\n$13.99 (available in six colors and rechargeable or battery operated).\nWanna know more? Check out\nour full review of this magical fabric defuzzer!\n20. A\nTubShroom so you don't have to worry about a wig's worth of hair accumulating in your drain every week.\nThis fits any standard 1.5-inch tub drain or bathroom sink drain. But, if you want to keep your hair catching separate between your tub and sink, then treat yourself and your home to the\nSinkShroom!\nPromising review: \"Does exactly what it claims. With three long-haired women in the house, keeping hair out of the drains was impossible. Now, cleaning the TubShroom is simple!\" ‚Äî\nDyan E.\nGet it from Amazon for\n$12.95+ (available in five colors).\n21.

Waited four hours! That's how impossible my hair was! My coarse, multi-highlighted, damaged and dry hair feels like normal hair.\" ‚Äî\nSusan Rooney\nGet it from Amazon for\n$7.29.\nBuzzFeed Shopping contributor\nBek O' Connell has this and loves it! Check out her full Elizavecca Protein Hair Treatment review for more info.\n22. A\nBissell Little Green carpet cleaner capable of sucking up messes of any caliber. Be warned, though: Reviewers say once you start, you won't stop.\nPromising review: \"Uhhhhhhmazing! I had to instantly use this product when I got home just because I've been so anxious with ordering it. But I am really impressed. We have a new puppy and a German Shepherd adult so keeping my carpet clean is almost impossible. I've already cleaned my stairs and bedroom and I have plenty more areas I wanna try it on!\" ‚Äî\nBrittany\nGet it from Amazon for\n$109.59+ (available in nine configurations).\n23. A\ngooseneck tablet and phone stand you can hook up to your bed frame or nightstand so you can mindlessly scroll TikTok ‚Äî look, Ma, no hands! ‚Äî while Netflix also plays in the background. üòà\nPromising review: \"My girlfriend and I will occasionally watch a show/movie on our\nKindle Fire before going to bed, and holding the Kindle while trying to fall asleep was obviously impossible. This holder attachment has been the perfect solution! The clamp expands to a surprisingly large distance, and I had no problem clipping to the headboard of our bed. Really happy with this purchase!\" ‚Äî Jim H.\nGet it from Amazon for\n$22.99+ (available in black and white).\n24. A\nSwitchBot button pusher you can install over any light switch or button-activated device so you can turn everything you own into a smart device. That way, when you're seven hours deep into a Love Island marathon and you literally couldn't be more comfy, you can turn off your lights or turn on your fan ‚Äî via Alexa, Google Home, or an app on your phone ‚Äî without having to get out of bed.\nReviewers love this because it doesn't require you to \"smart enable\" other parts of your home. It's also a great way to turn on your kettle or coffee brewer from the other room so it's ready for you when you get out of bed!\nPromising review: \"Solved an impossible problem for me. The wild wiring in the house I‚Äôm staying in prevents me from using an in-wall electrical smart switch, so I ordered this with a lack of any other options, and it works amazingly well. It‚Äôs worked to control a light switch without fail for the past two months. Yes, you‚Äôll need the hub to work with\nAlexa, but it‚Äôs not that expensive and the ecosystem for this company is actually really nice. I ended up buying a bunch more of their stuff and it‚Äôs all been great.\" ‚Äî David V\nGet it from Amazon for\n$29+ (available in white and black).\n25. A set of four\nsheet fasteners that are basically like suspenders for your mattress, because nothing ruins a morning like having the corner of your fitted sheet pop off as you roll over.\nSee them on TikTok\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@paul.rasoe/video/6954729587536334086?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id=7066140452953818629.\nPromising review: \"We have a very deep pillow-top mattress and it was essentially impossible to keep sheets from pooping up on the corners.

Absolute lifesavers.\" ‚Äî\nPaige Cappuccio\nGet a set of four from Amazon for\n $7.64+ (available in three colors and sets of four or eight).\n26. A six-pack of\nwashing machine cleaner tablets so leftover dirt, residue, and musty odors don't affix themselves to your laundry and make it even dirtier than when it went in.\nPromising review: \"I bought two of these products; one for a clothes washer, and\nanother for my dishwasher. Both of them work amazingly well, and left my appliances smelling great! They cleaned up the areas that would be otherwise almost impossible for me to reach. I definitely plan on ordering them again!\" ‚Äî Kristin Clevenger\nGet a pack of six from Amazon for\n$10.16.\n27. A\nleave-in conditioner for little ones with curly locks that are prone to tangles and breakage. Keratin, plum seed oil, and olive oil combine to leave them with shiny, healthy, incredible-smelling ringlets you can't help but sniff.\nPromising review: \"My son has very curly hair and can only be easily detangled while he‚Äôs given a bath.

AMAZING!\" ‚Äî Anna Bonilla\nGet it from Amazon for\n$7.99+ (available in packs of one or two).\n28. A\npair of *affordable* down-alternative cooling pillows if you're a particularly sweaty sleeper.\nPromising review: \"As someone who has had migraines for many years, these pillows have been life changing. My migraines always start in my neck, and finding pillows that don't aggravate my neck has been impossible. Until now. Before I started using these pillows, I would wake up many times a night, because my neck would get stiff and sore. I was never getting a solid, peaceful rest. The very first night that I started using these pillows, I got a full night's sleep, without tossing and turning and readjusting my pillow. I've been using them for two months now, and I haven't woken up with a migraine once.\" ‚Äî\nDaniel K. Vallus\nGet a set of two from Amazon for\n$60.91+ (and clip the coupon for 40% off!).\n29. A\n Terro garbage guard you can pop in the lid of your trash can if you're done dealing with flies, maggots, roaches, and beetles. This way, you don't have to fling open the lid and throw your trash from a few feet away while screaming like a banshee. www.amazon.com, Amazon\nThe nifty device releases an odorless vapor that kills insects and prevents future infestations for up to four months. It also comes with an adhesive strip so installation is easy peasy.\nPromising review: \"This is a great product. Every year during the warmer months, we have to deal with flies getting in our trash can and then we would have maggots in our trash can that are impossible to get rid of, not to mention how disgusting! We attach to this to the top of the trash can lid and no more disgusting problems. Just make sure the small device doesn't fall off into your trash, or you'll be wishing you had bought more than one. In fact, I did buy more than one because it happened to me and I never want to have that fly problem again. I highly recommend this product!!!!\" ‚Äî\nCheckers\nGet it from Amazon for\n$9.99.\n30. A pack of clinical-strength\nSweatBlock wipes capable of stopping hyperhidrosis, nervous sweating, and hormonal sweating right in its tracks.

This is STRONG so if you have sensitive skin, the manufacturer suggests you do a spot test first.\nPromising review: \"I had been trying to find a product that would help with sweating and keeping dry while going through menopause. Keeping embarrassing sweating down was impossible. I must have purchased 6 different products and aside from being expensive, nothing seemed to both eliminate sweat and stop odor. I was watching Rachael Ray one morning and the show was about remedies that worked. SweatBlock was mentioned so I became curious. SweatBlock really worked. It was affordable and I have raved to my other menopause friends. They too are now happy, dry, and satisfied customers.\" ‚Äî\nMs. Dry/Confident\nGet a pack of 10 from Amazon for\n$19.99.\n31. A\ngrooming glove so you can give your pet all the love they desire while covertly brushing away mats and tangles, too. Use it on wet or dry fur (it's great in the bath) and on your feline friends as well.\nPromising review: \"Awesome pet hair remover! I have a Korat mix cat with short hair that's impossible to groom with a brush. I've tried all kinds of combs and brushes and nothing has worked well on him. I took this out of the package, I showed it to him and let him sniff it, and then pet him with it. This thing is awesome! With just a few strokes I removed a ton of cat hair. I highly recommend this for hard-to-groom cats.\" ‚Äî\nLB in the OC\nGet it from Amazon for\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N66Y1IK?tag=bfchelsea-20&ascsubtag=7577674%2C31%2C38%2Cmobile_web%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%3A0%2C41039179%2C0%2C0%2C0.\n32. A\nflat outlet plug that can be placed behind furniture so you don't punch a hole in the back of your couch repeatedly ramming it as close to the wall as you can get it.\nPromising review: \"I wanted my nightstand flat against the wall, but with the electrical outlet behind it, it was impossible. This product was perfect! I was so pleased I ordered another so I could move the TV stand against the wall. Much nicer having the furniture in place. Really is flat against the wall!\" ‚Äî\nPamela Moore\nGet it from Amazon for\n$23.95+ (available in 12 different lengths/configurations).\n33. A\ntouchless vacuum you can sweep debris right into. No more song and dance with your dustpan trying to brush up every last speck of dust.\nPromising review: \"I recently had hip surgery and I have two large dogs that shed a lot! Using a dust pan was impossible so my husband purchased this and all I have to do is sweep the dirt over and it sucks it right up! I love it!\" ‚Äî\nJeannie Madigan\nGet it from Amazon for\n$149 (available in nine colors; clip the coupon for $20 off!).\n34. A handy dandy\nwad preventer to ensure your sheets don't tangle themselves up into a Boy Scout badge‚Äìworthy knot *and* not even get clean in the process. Wad-Free is a small biz from Cyndi Bray. Their products are made in the USA. Just pop the corners of your flat or fitted sheet into the device, and you'll never have to deal with tangling and twisting again! Believe it or not (I mean believe it...the reviews are there), the manufacturer even says that your sheets will dry 75% faster and with fewer wrinkles.\nPromising review: \"Who knew I needed this. I was starting and stopping my dryer four or five times whenever I was drying my bed sheets. They would ball up making them impossible to dry. This Wad-free device works exactly as described. Problem solved.\" ‚Äî\nBeerMC00\n35. A\nfur-eliminating broom capable of squeegeeing enough fur from your carpet that if magically animated ‚Äî you know, like those brooms in Fantasia ‚Äî it would transform into a Pekingese.\nPromising review: \"I have a giant Saint Bernard who sheds constantly no matter how much I brush her. My carpet was covered with fur, and I felt so overwhelmed with how impossible it was to get clean. I actually feel like my carpet is clean now! I rake about once a day just to keep up with all the fur she sheds. I definitely recommend this for dog owners. It also helps bring life back into carpet that got matted down by heavy furniture or in walkways. Seriously, if you have dogs that shed a lot, get this for your carpet!!\" ‚Äî\nAnna Domet\nGet it from Amazon for\n$12.99+ (available in seven configurations).\n36. A\nbeauty spatula because you spent $40 on that color-matching foundation and you'll be damned if even one drop goes to waste.\nPromising review: \"Such a simple product, I have a foundation primer that I love that comes in a glass pump bottle, and is impossible to get the dregs out of it even when so much product remains. This gets me at least eight more days out of each bottle.\" ‚Äî\nKatie Drewry\nGet it from Amazon for\n$5.49.\n37. And a\ndrain cover so you can add ~inches~ of extra water to your bubble bath. No more readjusting every five minutes so all parts of your body can experience what it's like to actually be underwater!\nPromising review: \"I have an older bathtub and found it impossible to get a nice relaxing bath without the overflow safety decreasing the water level to a less than enjoyable amount. Enter this handle little gizmo. It works perfectly. Allows me to fill the tub to a nice amount but still has a safety in place so as to not completely overflow.
