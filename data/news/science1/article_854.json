    "text": "Patna: Come 2024, the state will get a centre for rare and neglected diseases (RND) - health issues which mostly skip the common diagnostic methods like muscular dystrophies or metabolic and carbohydrate disorders - at All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna (AIIMS-P), said executive director Dr G K Pal on Thursday.A team of experts from the health ministry visited the AIIMS-P on Thursday, inspected the infrastructure available with different departments and held a meeting with executive director Dr Pal to discuss the ways for launching the new initiative for healthcare and medical research.Earlier, the proposal for a centre of excellence for RND, equipped with all diagnostic and treatment facilities, had been approved by the institutional body of the AIIMS-P and routed through other medical bodies to the Centre for a final approval. Dr Pal said rare and neglected diseases comprised a group of ailments, mostly genetic, which could also prove fatal in many cases. \\\"A centre for RND in the state will be of great help not only to the people of Bihar but neighbouring states as well. There could be a good number of RND cases in Bihar but most of them remain neglected for want of proper diagnosis and treatment. The new RND centre is likely to start functioning early next year,\\\" he said.Dr Pal added having their genesis in the foetal make-up, RND are genetic or hereditary diseases. \\\"Common RND include muscular dystrophies, metabolic disorder, carbohydrate disorder, glycogen storage diseases, phenylketonuria, maple syrup urine disease, gaucher disease, severe combined immunodeficiency and Niemann-Pick Disease.\\\"Dr Anil Kumar, officer on special duty to the executive director and a professor of trauma department, said since RND were associated with several branches of medicine, the central team inspected departments like paediatrics, pathology, radiology, genetics, neurology, microbiology and paediatric rheumatology.Thorough screening of intra-uterine life at health centres could help in early detection of RND and accordingly planning of healthcare and medication could help improve the quality of a patient's life, he said.",
