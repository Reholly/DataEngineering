    "text": "2023-12-28 20:00:00\nL’Année Automobile is one of the oldest publications devoted to automobiles since it was born at the end of the 1953 season. L’Année Automobile is the only work which, since then, covers current events in the fields of industry, sport and culture, the multiple changes of which she has thus been able to recount over the course of these seventy-one years of existence.\nAn institution that dates back to 1953.\nThe initiator of the publication was Ami Guichard, a Swiss journalist, enthusiastic, enlightened amateur, who from 1953 to 1982 animated and published this book under the banner of Edita, in Lausanne. From the start, Ami Guichard set the tone, understanding the world of automobiles from the angles of economics, design, sport and technology.\nThe publication changed its name several times over the following years, passing under the umbrella of Éditions 24 Heures from 1983 to 1985, Édipresse in 1986, Lamunière SA in 1987 before settling permanently under the banner of Éditions JR de Jean-Rodolphe Piccard from 1988 to 2004.\nBetween 2005 and 2008, L’Année Autiomoble left Lausanne to settle in Monte-Carlo under the authority of Christian Philippsen. Since 2009, the ETAI flag has flown above the publication, before the publishing house itself is owned by Sophia in 2022.\nThe editorial management has also known several leaders over these different periods: Ami Guichard from 1953 to 1970 (relayed by Günther Molter in 1963), José Rosinski from 1972 to 1977, Jean-Rodolphe Piccard in 1981 and 1982 and from 1986 to 2004, assisted by Roland Christen from 1983 to 1985, Christian Philippsen from 2005 to 2008, and the signatory of these lines from 2009 to 2022.\nRead more: spot dividend stocks Accepting short-term risk factors I TNN know how to invest I 01-09-66 - TNN Online\nSubscribe to the Caradisiac newsletter\nReceive all the automotive news\nI agree to receive partner offers\nRegister\nThe email address provided in this form is processed by GROUPE LA CENTRALE as data controller.\nThis data is used to send you information about our offers, news and events (newsletters, alerts, invitations and other publications).\nIf you have accepted it, this data will be transmitted to our partners, as data controllers, to allow you to receive their communication electronically.\nYou have a right of access, rectification, deletion of this data, a right to limit processing, a right of opposition, the right to portability of your data and the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (in France, the CNIL).

He is surrounded by collaborators experienced in this particular exercise which consists of merging the spirit of the press, through the precision of information and the expression of opinion, and a know-how based on reflection and hindsight, the prerogatives of publishing.\nAnd this, by resolutely distancing itself from the immediacy and staleness inherent to the Internet.\nThe new team fits brilliantly into this requirement for singularity.\n1703803342\n#Automotive #Year",
