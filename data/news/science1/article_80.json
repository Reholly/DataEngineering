Start your personal success story with ChessBase and enjoy the game even more.\nMagnus Carlsen continues to collect World Championship titles. Thanks to a brilliant 3-day performance in Samarkand, the Norwegian grabbed his fifth World Rapid Championship title after obtaining an undefeated 10/13 score.\nSince 2013, Carlsen has won 16 World Championship titles. The first one he got was, in fact, the classical title ‚Äî\nin Chennai. The very next year he grabbed the ‚Äòtriple crown‚Äô, after winning both the rapid and blitz categories in Dubai.\nThe 33-year-old went on to win four more matches for the world crown in classical chess and collected five more blitz titles and (now) four more rapid titles.\nAs pointed out by Tarjei J. Svensen, perhaps the most impressive fact if we look back on Carlsen‚Äôs performance on these all-important events is his incredible stability. In ten World Rapid Championships, the ace has never finished below fifth place!\nPerhaps the most impressive thing with Carlsen in these events, isn't just that he tends to win many of them, but his stability. His placements in the World Rapid Ch. since 2012:‚Äî Tarjei J. Svensen (@TarjeiJS)\n2023: üèÜ\n2022: üèÜ\n2021: ü•â\n2019: üèÜ\n2018: 5th\n2017: 5th\n2016: ü•â\n2015: üèÜ\n2014: üèÜ\n2012: ü•à\n[December 28, 2023]\nIn Samarkand, Carlsen entered day 3 of the rapid sharing first place with Vladimir Fedoseev and Yu Yangyi. Round 10, the first of the day, saw him beating Fedoseev in the critical clash of co-leaders. Carlsen became the sole leader and did not let go of that spot until the end of the tournament.\nA second consecutive win, over Iranian GM Pouya Idani, left him a half point ahead of Vidit Gujrathi in the standings. Vidit came from grabbing back-to-back victories over Anton Korobov and Arjun Erigaisi. The run of consecutive wins could have continued in round 12, as Vidit got a clear advantage in his game with white against Fedoseev.\nThis is a completely winning setup for White. Not only does he have an extra pawn and the bishop pair in an open position, but he also has the initiative. Incredibly, however, Vidit began to play imprecise moves at around this point, first giving up his advantage and then blundering into a lost position.\nAfter losing this game, Vidit drew Maxime Vachier-Lagrave to finish in shared third place (fourth on tiebreaks) with 9/13 points. The\nwinner of the FIDE Grand Swiss then shared a post on X confessing, ‚ÄúThis won‚Äôt be easy to forgetüíî‚Äù.\nVidit Gujrathi | Photo: FIDE / Lennart Ootes\nFedoseev‚Äôs victory left him in sole second place a half point behind Carlsen going into the final round. Both contenders for the title got the white pieces and drew their games ‚Äî against Praggnanandhaa and Dmitry Andreikin respectively ‚Äî which meant the perennial favourite had secured outright victory.\nWith his 9¬Ω/13 performance, Fedoseev, now representing Slovenia, finished in sole second place. A 12-player group scored 9/13 points, with Yu Yangyi grabbing the bronze medal on tiebreak criteria.\nThe biggest underdog in the large group with 9 points was Volodar Murzin, who finished the tournament undefeated and collected wins over Praggnanandhaa, Ian Nepomniachtchi and Levon Aronian!\nVolodar Murzin | Photo: FIDE / Lennart Ootes\nCongratulations to Magnus Carlsen for his fifth Rapid crown.

At that point, third seed Lei Tingjie (the challenger of the latest\nmatch for the Women‚Äôs World Championship) had caught up with her in the lead. A group of five players stood a half point behind with one round to go.\nCo-leaders Lei and Bodnaruk signed a 3-move draw in the final round, a more understandable decision for Bodnaruk, who both had the black pieces and a better tiebreak score ‚Äî in case of a tie for first between more than two players, the two participants with the better tiebreak scores would decide the tournament winner in a blitz playoff.\nOut of all the chasers, only Humpy grabbed a win in round 11, as she obtained an advantage out of the opening and converted it into a victory playing white against Kateryna Lagno.\nBodnaruk and Humpy had better tiebreak scores than Lei, which meant they were to play a blitz playoff to decide the championship.\nHumpy Koneru beat the ever-fighting Kateryna Lagno to catch the leaders in the final round | Photo: FIDE / Lennart Ootes\nLei Tingjie grabbed the bronze medal | Photo: FIDE / Lennart Ootes\nIn the playoff, Humpy ‚Äî who won this event\nback in 2019 ‚Äî kicked off with a win. Bodnaruk bounced back with black in a wild encounter, which meant two more blitz games would follow.\nThe third blitz encounter ended in a draw, and once again it was Bodnaruk who prevailed in the rematch, when she obtained a major time advantage ‚Äî while getting a clearly inferior position on the board.\nHumpy, playing white, has a piece for two pawns here, with a winning position. Her 38.Kc7 was a mistake, as it allowed 38...Rxb3, and the position is now balanced.\nMore importantly, though, this miss seems to have befuddled the Indian star, who lost on time after 39.Rd4 Bd5.
