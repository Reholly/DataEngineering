    "text": "It's a new year, which means it's time for an all-around reset.\nLooking for a way to bring life and fresh design into your home office? We called on organization expert Ryen Toft from San Diego organizing firm Simply Luxe to give us tips to refresh our workspace.\nRead her design advice and shop our product picks below.\nBy clicking on these shopping links, visitors will leave Goodmorningamerica.com.

Prices may change from the date of publication.\nAdd a pop of color \\\"One of the easiest ways to bring life to your office is to add a little color. They have come so far with removable wallpapers these days. The color and design options are endless. Whether you are going for a tranquil design or a statement piece, you'll find it. They even have options with textures like seagrass that give it a dimension you didn't think it needed. Now, putting it up might sound intimidating, but when you break the room up into zones it's a much easier undertaking.\\\"\nGo vertical \\\"Adding in vertical pieces like an over-the-door organizer helps to organize up and off the ground or desktops -- creating a streamlined look that helps to relieve the clutter. Creating an easy-to-maintain system, while utilizing every inch of wall space (or door space), truly is key. If you do not have any additional wall space, think of adding small storage carts to help contain items as well.\\\"\nAdd a bit of greenery \\\"Adding plants and greenery to a space brings in not only fresh air, but a wave of relaxation. If you're not a green thumb, think about adding in faux options.\\\"\nAdd matching containers \\\"Create a place you feel productive in. By minimizing the visual clutter by having matching containers, you will instantly feel more inspired, and less fatigue. Visual clutter is the number one killer in spaces. Having a cohesive container and basket situation adds that level of design and clarity your office is seeking. After you add in the labels, you've now created a cohesive space but also a very easy to manage system to put everything away in a jiff too.\\\"\nLet books double as decor \\\"You don't have to go crazy and buy books all in the same color scheme (there are sites where you can do this in case you're missing colors in your ROYGBIV design!). Simply start by deciding how you would like your shelves to be styled, how you enjoy grabbing books off the shelves, and then go from there. If you love grabbing by genres, or alphabetically, then start there. If you love color coordinating, then add that pop of color to the room. Having your books organized and designed in the way you enjoy, you'll access them more, feel more inclined to use them or reference them than when they were left unattended on the desk or floor.\nMore picks",
