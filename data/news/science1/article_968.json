    "text": "“These are the best times for the youth in India\\\": Dr Jitendra SinghChandrayaan and other such science success stories in recent times have triggered children's imagination and aptitude. Curiosity in young minds will drive innovations in science and technology and bring growth in the country’s economy. This was stated by Dr Jitendra Singh, Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Science & Technology. He was speaking after presenting the CSIR Young Scientist Awards & GN Ramachandran Medal for the year 2022, at a function in New Delhi.“Prime Minister Modi has a scientific temperament and keenly promotes science and technology based initiatives and projects,” he said.Dr Jitendra Singh said CSIR has enabled India to acquire the frontline role in the comity of nations. “Since we are now following the world's parameters and strategies and living up to world's benchmarks, we will also have to be in the same league as they are,” he said.Dr Jitendra Singh said women have assumed a leadership role in an increasing number of science and technology projects.“Increasingly, we have seen in these award functions, the number of women is increasing. In many instances the women outnumber the men,” he said.The Union Minister said that, after the Chandrayaan-3 landing on the Moon, there has been an abundant curiosity and public interest about the country’s space exploration programme. “Students should visit the CSIR labs which are the modern day monuments of New India,” he said.The Minister expressed the hope that in the coming years, innovation will play a vital role in transforming India into a $5 trillion economy.“The third generation of post-Independence Bharat is the most fortunate as they are no longer the prisoners of their aspirations,” said Dr Jitendra Singh. “These are one of the best times for the youth in India,” he added.",
