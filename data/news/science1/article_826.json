Mariana describes herself as a Mexican trained in medicine and interested in women’s health, mother of two girls and director of Medicas, a space where other professionals converge who collaborate to find a new form of medicine that provides benefits for women. . They are innovation was rooted in an experience of harassment by cis menso it was important for her to have a safer space to care for women, since processes such as pregnancy, menstruation and menopause are topics with which she has a great affinity and that is why she decided to specialize in gynecology. Medicine for women with a feminist perspective Mariana Robles considers that the feminist perspective It has to be more common and not seen as something extraordinary. “Gynecology that is not centered on women is meaningless… With this vision, more factors are integrated: social, economic, cultural, and it changes the way you see your patient.” Its intention is to have more and better resources to support women who are cared for, according to their conditions, with empathy and understanding. Despite her work, she has faced a very big challenge and that is understanding that current medicine does not favor comprehensive care. Mariana explains that her perspective has helped her to have more congruence in practice and decent treatment, since she has been able to make social changes in the way in which: I talk to my daughters, how to talk about sexuality and how I bond with a partner Despite her proposal, Mariana Robles expresses her concern as a woman in the face of normalized violence in the medical area, as she believes that it was common to remain silent. “I don’t know if she would go through the same situations with this feminist ideology and raising her voice like now.” 1703813782 #Innovative #Women #Mariana #Robles #practices #medicine #feminist #perspective",
