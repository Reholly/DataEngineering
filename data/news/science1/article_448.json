    "text": "Orange County is strengthening its protections for the area’s vast expanse of wetlands, delicate but critical natural areas often imperiled by pressure for new development.\nThe updated rules, effective June 1, were two years in the making but won unanimous approval at the county board’s final meeting of 2023.\nWetlands, sometimes called the earth’s kidneys because they filter pollutants from water that flows through them, account for 162,000 acres, about a quarter of the county’s area, but have shrunk at rates alarming to environmental groups.\nThey also help prevent neighborhood flooding by absorbing runoff from heavy rains.\n“Most of our uplands are already developed and so that leaves mostly lower wet areas,” said Deborah Green, president of Orange Audubon, which endorsed revision of the 35-year-old ordinance. “Even small wetlands have importance to wildlife. From the point of view of birds and nature, we want to save as many wetlands as possible.”\nThe county has lost about 4% of its wetland acres since 1990, according to a study conducted for the revision.\n The new ordinance was crafted through workshops and public meetings with goals to strengthen wetland protections, streamline the county’s permitting processes and ensure natural resource protections are balanced with property rights, said Tim Hull, Orange County’s environmental programs administrator, who supervised the revision.\nDevelopers who propose to dredge or fill in a wetland must get a county permit before beginning.\nTo keep the public informed of the changes, division spokesperson Denise Cochran created a special page on the county website that was dedicated to the ordinance, including a “Wetlands 101” educational primer, videos and PowerPoints.\n“Although wetlands are often wet, a wetland might not be wet year-round. In fact, some of the most important wetlands are only seasonally wet,” according to a fact sheet created by the U.S. Environmental Protection Division. “They are transition zones where the flow of water, the cycling of nutrients and the energy of the sun meet to produce a unique ecosystem characterized by hydrology, soils and vegetation—making these areas very important features of a watershed.”\n...continued swipe to next page « 1 2 » View full story\n©2023 Orlando Sentinel.
