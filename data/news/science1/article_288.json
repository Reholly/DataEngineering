    "text": "Most people probably have at least one spot in their home that could benefit from some additional lighting. Not trendy geometric fixtures, or classic vintage lamps, but lighting that’s more functional than fashionable, and allows you to make better use of the living and/or storage space in your home. We’re talking about closets, crawlspaces, and constantly dark corners of the basement: places lacking a light source, even during the day.\nThis is where rechargeable motion sensor lights come in. And you don’t need the skills or money for actual electrical work, because these are self-adhesive and can be installed in minutes. Here’s what to know about this simple and reasonably priced lighting solution.\nWhere to use rechargeable motion sensor lights indoors\nIf you’re picturing the kind of motion sensor flood lights often installed above garage doors, replace that image with one of a thin strip of LED lights eight or 12 inches long, or a round light no larger than a smoke detector (though they’re available in other shapes and sizes, too).\nThe basic idea is that instead of opening a dark closet or drawer, or feeling your way down a hallway or set of stairs, these lights will automatically turn on when motion is detected, and shut off when it stops. Most models also have the option to switch the light on and off, rather than relying on the motion sensor.\nThe lights typically come with a self-adhesive magnetic strip that you place on the wall, cabinet, or other surface. The back of the light itself is also magnetic, so you’re able to remove it from the strip and plug it into a power source with a USB cable to recharge. Personally, I use them in closets that don’t have another source of light, as well as under the kitchen cabinet above my sink, which doesn’t benefit much from the overhead light. Rechargeable motion sensor lights can also come in handy in other spots, including:\n- Hallways\n- Stairs\n- Crawlspaces\n- Basements\n- Attics\n- The space under the stairs\n- Front/back/side porches\n- Kids’ bedrooms\n- As a bathroom nightlight\nProduct examples and features\nHere are a few examples of highly rated rechargeable motion sensor lights, and their standout features:\nLEPOTEC 30-LED Motion Sensor Cabinet Light(US$21.99 for pack of two): I received this set of two strips of LED lights as a gift a little over a year ago, and they’re still going strong with daily use. Electight Motion Sensor Light(US$19.99 for 6-pack): At 3 ¼ inches in diameter, these small discs can be placed in a line to create the look of a vanity, or on their own for extra light in drawers. Lightbiz LED Motion Sensor Light(US$25.99 for pack of two): These light strips come with a small remote control that you can use to dim the lights, and turn them off after 10, 30, 60, or 120 minutes.\nGenerally speaking, the lights are equally simple to install, so you can base your purchasing decision on the features that are most important to you.\n ",
