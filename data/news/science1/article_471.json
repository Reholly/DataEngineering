    "text": "2023-12-28 23:10:00\nAn international research group has developed an innovative, high-strength flexible device, paving the way for a new generation of autonomous sensors. This innovation could transform the way we interact with Internet of Things (IoT) technologies.\nThe device, the result of an international collaboration, combines piezoelectric composites with unidirectional carbon fibers (UDCF), an anisotropic material that provides strength only in the direction of the fibers.\nThis new device transforms kinetic energy from human movement into electricity, providing an efficient and reliable means for high-resistance autonomous sensors.\nTowards a sustainable future\nMotion sensing, which involves converting the energy of human movement into measurable electrical signals, is essential to ensuring a sustainable future.\n« Many everyday objects, from protective equipment to sports equipment, are connected to the Internet as part of the Internet of Things (IoT), and many of them are equipped with sensors that collect data “, explains Fumio Narita, co-author of the study and professor at the\nTohoku University.\nPrinciple, structural design and application of unidirectional flexible carbon fiber reinforced piezoelectric nanocomposite materials. Tohoku University\nA promising device\nThe group fabricated the device using a combination of unidirectional carbon fiber fabric (UDCF) and sodium-potassium niobate nanoparticles (KNN) mixed with epoxy resin (EP).\nThe UDCF served as both an electrode and a directional reinforcer.\nThe UDCF/KNN-EP system met expectations. Tests found that it could maintain high performance even after being stretched more than 1000 times. It has been proven that it can withstand a much higher load when pulled along the direction of the fiber compared to other flexible materials.\nSynthetic\nThe UDCF/KNN-EP device represents a significant advancement in the development of autonomous and flexible IoT sensors.
