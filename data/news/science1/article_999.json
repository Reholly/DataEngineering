Epub 2023 Dec 1. PMID:\n38043803\nDanyang Li\nBisphenol A (BPA) has been implicated in cognitive impairment. Icariin is the main active ingredient extracted from Epimedium Herb with protective function of nervous system. However, the potential therapeutic effects of Icariin on spatial memory deficits induced by developmental BPA exposure in Sprague-Dawley rats have not been investigated. This study investigated the therapeutic effect of Icariin (10 mg/kg/day, from postnatal day (PND) 21 to PND 60 by gavage) on spatial memory deficits in rat induced by developmental BPA exposure (1 mg/kg/day, from embryonic to PND 60), demonstrating that Icariin can markedly improve spatial memory in BPA-exposed rat. Furthermore, intra-gastric administration of Icariin could attenuate abnormal hippocampal cell dispersion and loss, improved the dendritic spine density and Nissl bodies. Moreover, Icariin reversed BPA induced reduction of frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents(mEPSC) and decrease of Vesicular glutamate transporter 1(VGlut1). Collectively, Icariin could effectively rescue BPA-induced spatial memory impairment in male rats by preventing cell loss and reduction of dendritic spines in the hippocampus. In addition, we also found that VGlut1 is a critical target in the repair of BPA-induced spatial memory by Icariin. Thus, Icariin may be a promising therapeutic agent to attenuate BPA-induced spatial memory deficits.\nIcariin : CK(10) : AC(7) Bisphenol Toxicity : CK(2930) : AC(882) Neuroprotective Agents : CK(10404) : AC(4396) Bisphenol A : CK(3250) : AC(951)",
