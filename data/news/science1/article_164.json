    "text": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. â€” After years of possible sightings, an illusive species has finally been discovered to reside in an enormous forest, about 30 minutes outside of Louisville, Kentucky.\nThe nine-banded armadillo was recently confirmed as the newest species and 51st mammal in Bernheim Forest.\nThe discovery was verified by Bernheim staff when an armadillo was found on a roadside, unfortunately, hit and killed by a car.\nAccording to an\nannouncement on the Bernheim Forest website, armadillos getting hit by cars is a common occurrence in areas with robust armadillo populations.\nThe scattered reports and this one individual confirmed animal suggest a small population exists within Bernheim.\n\"Be on the lookout during your next visit and you too might get a chance to see this southwestern armored creature,\" a Bernheim statement said.\nMake it easy to keep up-to-date with more stories like this.
