    "text": "UBTech Robotics, China’s biggest manufacturer of educational and humanoid robots, climbed on the first day of trading in Hong Kong, after raising HK$1 billion (US$130 million) of proceeds in the city’s final initial public offering (IPO) of the year.\\nThe stock gained 0.1 per cent to HK$90.10 at 2pm local time on Friday, versus its IPO price of HK$90, giving the Shenzhen-based company trading under 9880 code a HK$37.6 billion market capitalisation. The Hang Seng Index was little changed, holding at a four-week high on Thursday.\\nZhou Jian, the 47-year old founder and CEO of UBTech, and the firm’s Walker S humanoid service robot, struck the listing gong to mark the occasion. Zhou’s direct 24.8 per cent stake in the firm would be worth about US$1.2 billion at current market price. Tencent, the WeChat operator, has a 6.3 per cent stake.\\n\\n“Since the founding of the company, UBTech always keeps in mind the mission of having robots in every household,” Zhou said at the listing event. “After the IPO, the company will continue to deliver its promise [and] deepen its research on robotics.”\\nThe debut lit some sparks in a gloomy year for Hong Kong’s stock market. The number of IPOs fell by about a tenth, according to Refinitiv data. Proceeds collected from investors declined 54 per cent to a 20-year low of HK$46 billion.\\nMore than US$520 billion billion of market value has evaporated across the Hong Kong stock exchange this year, according to Bloomberg data. The Hang Seng Index tumbled 15 per cent in an unprecedented four-year losing streak. Its top three losers, Li Ning, Country Garden Services and Zhongsheng Group, plunged by 53 per cent to 69 per cent as of December 28.\\nCainiao, Midea, SF and Movoi among hotly anticipated Hong Kong IPOs of 2024\\nUBTech sold 11.3 million new shares to investors in Hong Kong and globally, pricing the offering at the lower end of its target range of HK$86 to HK$116, according to a stock exchange filing on Thursday. The IPO generated 5.2 times from Hong Kong investors and 2.2 times from global funds.\\nUBTech, known for its toy Star Wars stormtrooper robots, filed its stock offering in February. It has a 23 per cent share of China’s educational robot market, which contributed 77 per cent to its annual sales in the past three years. It also builds advanced humanoid robots targeting the healthcare sector.\\nChina’s service robot market is forecast to grow at an annual compound rate of 24 per cent to 183.2 billion yuan (US$25.6 billion) by 2028, outpacing the 18 per cent growth rate globally, according to a report by Frost & Sullivan published in the IPO prospectus.\\nGuotai Junan Securities was the sole sponsor and global coordinator of the IPO. Citic Securities, CMBC Capital, Huatai Securities, BNP Paribas and Shenwan Hongyuan also joined as global coordinators.\\nAdditional reporting by Li Jiaxing\\n",
