    "text": "Prepare and make professional streams where you control everything from encoder and bitrate to subscribers and accounts via this application.\n#Manage stream #Stream manager #Broadcast manager #Stream #Broadcast #Manager\nSoftpedia Review\nspecifications\nFree Download Alexandra Sava\nStreamlabs Desktop is an all-in-one utility that packs dozens of overlays and easy-to-use features to help you make professional broadcasts from various sources, online and offline.\nFollowing a swift and uneventful installation, you will be happy to learn that the tool can be set up, and you can start streaming in just a couple of minutes. In fact, you can opt for one of the dozens of overlays available and go live directly. The only thing that you need to account is to test the widgets that you selected before opening the app.\nThen again, if you prefer to design your own streaming window, then you can easily do so from the Editor tab. Making your own streaming pattern, in this case, means changing or adding scenes, sources and mixer, which is mostly the audio, recording and visual controls of the stream setup.\nThe highlight of the application steams from the numerous overlay available, some of them being animated. As you would expect, you can make any desired modifications to these designs, as the frames are both removable and adjustable. If you are still not satisfied, then you can make additional changes in the Editor.\nAt the same time, the program includes a dashboard window that allows you to access and manage anything related to broadcasts, including, but not limited to widgets, alert profiles, donation settings, account settings, so on and so forth. On a side note, from here you can also set up the alerts that you would like to receive notifications.\nRegardless of whether you are creating streams as part of your profession or you simply want to make a broadcast that can captivate your audience, then perhaps Streamlabs could come in handy.\nStreamlabs Desktop 1.16.3add to watchlist add to download basket send us an update REPORT\n- runs on:\n-\nWindows 11\nWindows 10 32/64 bit\nWindows 8 32/64 bit\nWindows 7 32/64 bit\n- file size:\n- 235 MB\n- filename:\n- Streamlabs Desktop Setup 1.16.3.exe\n- main category:\nInternet\n- developer:\n-\nvisit homepage Bitdefender Antivirus Free Microsoft Teams paint.net Windows Sandbox Launcher 4k Video Downloader 7-Zip IrfanView Zoom Client ShareX calibre\n- Zoom Client\n- ShareX\n- calibre\n- Bitdefender Antivirus Free\n- Microsoft Teams\n- paint.net\n- Windows Sandbox Launcher\n- 4k Video Downloader\n- 7-Zip\n- IrfanView",
