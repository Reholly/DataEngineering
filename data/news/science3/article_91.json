    "text": "Respawn just gifted eight free packs to every player in Apex Legends. The limited-time offer comes as an apology from the devs following recent complications involving data outages, loot box bugs, in-game challenges being reset and disappearing rank badges . Here’s everything you need to know about why we’re getting Apex free packs, and how to claim yours. Player frustrations began right after the Apex Legends April Fools’ event, which saw a massive data outage that wiped the levels and cosmetics collections off thousands of accounts. Despite most of the account-related issues being fixed now, the incident still left a sour taste in the community’s mouth. The fanbase hasn’t been too pleased about the state of the game either. Despite getting numerous improvements in the Season 20 update, faith in Apex’s anti-cheat software has been at an all-time low. Many in the esports scene were also discouraged after a team was hacked in the middle of a major tournament. Back in March, ALGS regional finalists Noyan “Genburten” Ozkose and Phillip “Imperialhal” Dosen were in the middle of a heated skirmish when both players suddenly gained access to wall hacks and aimbot cheats. The incident caused the Global Series tournament to be postponed entirely. Shortly after, Respawn made commitments to fix the game and make it up to the players. Simply log into Apex Legends before April 24 at 10am PT to claim your Apex Legends free packs. On their official X (previously Twitter) account, Respawn thanked the community for their continued patience, and announced that players who log in within the next two weeks would get the free Apex packs in their accounts. All eight of the Apex Legends free packs offer the standard chances of getting rare loot and bespoke cosmetics in the game. Eitherway, more loot boxes mean better chances of getting high-tier loot like Heirloom Shards, and their extremely rare Heirloom items. So log in and get your free Apex packs!
