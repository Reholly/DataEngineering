    "text": "New 3D-Printing Method Makes Printing Objects More Affordable and Eco-Friendly The discovery has the potential to advance the world of additive manufacturing. University of Florida engineers have developed a method for 3D printing called vapor-induced phase-separation 3D printing, or VIPS-3D, to create single-material and multi-material objects. Yong Huang, Ph.D., a professor in UF’s [Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering](https://mae.ufl.edu/mechanical-engineering/), said the printing process he and colleagues developed allows manufacturers to create custom-made objects economically and sustainably. The novel approach was reported Tuesday in the journal [Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47452-9). “It is more economical and much simpler than current counterpart technologies,” he said. “It’s an affordable process for printing advanced materials, including metals.” To understand the process, imagine using special eco-friendly liquids to make the “ink” for a 3D printer. These dissolvable polymer-based liquids can include metal or ceramic particles. When you print with this ink, a non-solvent vapor is released into the printing area. This vapor makes the liquid part of the ink solidify, leaving behind the solid material — called the vapor-induced phase-separation process.Read more about [New 3D-Printing Method Makes Printing Objects More Affordable and Eco-Friendly.](https://www.news.ufl.edu/2024/04/new-3d-printing-method/)",
