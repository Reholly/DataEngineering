    "text": "Lanzante built its LM 25 models to commemorate 25 years since the F1 GTR’s Le Mans win. This Senna GTR is inspired by the famous Tokyo Ueno Clinic F1 GTR. The car has been converted to be road legal in the UK. Few companies are as well versed in making extraordinary cars even more extraordinary than Lanzante. Next month, one of the finest McLarens to roll out of its British workshop will be auctioned off and is expected to sell for between €1.4 million ($1.5 million) and €1.6 million ($1.72 million).\nThe car in question is a special Senna GTR known as an LM 25 model. Lanzante launched its LM 25 in 2020 to commemorate the 25 th anniversary of the F1 GTR’s famous win at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Just seven units have been built to represent the seven F1s that competed at Le Mans in 1995, spanning McLaren’s Sports, Super, and Ultimate Series.\nRead: McLaren P1 GTR To Be Transformed Into A Drift Hypercar By Lazante\nThis Senna GTR is painted in the same light grey paintwork as the famous Tokyo Ueno Clinic F1 GTR. It also sits on lightweight forged aluminum and carbon fiber wheels, rocks Tokyo Ueno Clinic branding behind the doors, and has the race number ‘59’ etched into the lower door glass.\nSeveral special touches have been made to the cabin of the McLaren too. It has carbon fiber racing seats similar to those of the F1 GTR, rocks blue racing harnesses, and has been fitted with drilled gold pedals. Lanzante has also installed a carbon fiber steering wheel and a replica scrutineering decal on the rear bulkhead from the F1 GTR.\nPhoto Credits: Kevin Van Campenhout/RM Sotheby’s RM Sotheby’s says the car wasn’t just converted into an LM 25 model by Lanzante but is also now road-legal in the UK, making it even more desirable. It has been driven less than 2,000 km (~1,242 miles) and was most recently served in September 2023. It will also be sold with the original paperwork, intercom headsets for the passengers and driver, and a center-lock wheel removal tool.\nPhoto Credits: Kevin Van Campenhout/RM Sotheby’s",
