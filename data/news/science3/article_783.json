    "text": "NEW ORLEANS – March 22, 2024 — The American Heart Association, a global force for healthier lives for all, is working to close the gender gap in STEM careers. The Association hosted its 4th\nSTEM Goes Red event in New Orleans on Friday, March 24th. The event, held at Xavier University, brought together more than 90 young women from Hynes Charter School - Parkview, Hynes Charter School - Lakeview, and Martin Behrman School to participate in networking opportunities, speed mentoring, hands-on activities and breakout sessions with leaders from STEM industries.\n“Even as schools encourage young women and girls to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), women are still underrepresented among students with STEM majors and careers,” said Coretta LaGarde, executive director of the American Heart Association of Greater New Orleans. “Women, especially women of color, make up a small share of scientists and engineers. Of 100 female students working toward a bachelor’s degree, only three will work in a STEM job 10 years after graduation.”\nSTEM Goes Red is locally sponsored by Entergy, with additional local support from LCMC Health, JP Morgan Chase & Co, and Care Eleven Health. The goal is to deepen the pipeline of women entering STEM careers by exposing middle to high school age girls, and students overall, to the innovative strides women are making in fields like health care and engineering. The Greater New Orleans STEM Goes Red 2024 program featured hands-on activities like Hands Only CPR and stop the bleed training, learning about the technology behind virtual doctor visits and telemedicine, building a bridge with popsicle sticks to understand the engineering behind structures in our lives and understanding financial planning and goal setting. Through these kinds of programs, which inspire young women to become scientific and medical innovators, the American Heart Association is furthering its goal to improve health outcomes in New Orleans and beyond.\n\"Entergy is proud to partner with the American Heart Association for STEM Goes Red,” said Patty Riddlebarger, Entergy vice president of corporate social responsibility. “This program serves as a beacon of inspiration for young female students, encouraging them to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and math. By championing these programs, we are empowering the next generation to realize their potential, bridge the gender gap and shape a brighter tomorrow.\"\nSTEM Goes Red is a part of the Association's Go Red for Women movement to reduce heart disease and stroke in women. By giving students access to leading employers and experts, they have an insider look at what they do. The students gain firsthand experience, connect with inspiring professionals and learn about jobs across STEM fields. With support from local communities, employers and schools, STEM Goes Red helps young women uncover their potential.\nClick here to learn more.\n###\nAbout Go Red for Women\nThe American Heart Association’s Go Red for Women® movement is the trusted, passionate, relevant force for change to end heart disease and stroke in women all over the world.
