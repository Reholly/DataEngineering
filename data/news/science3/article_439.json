    "text": "LAKE CHARLES, La. (KPLC) - A new flight program is aiming to put students in the sky, boost the economy and help the airline industry.\nSOWELA Technical Community College was awarded $3.5 million from the U.S. Department of Economic Development Administration, $2 million from the City of Lake Charles and a self-investment of $1.1 million to create a flight school with Chennault International Airport.\nThe school’s airframe and power plant aviation program has been helping students learn about and work on planes, and now the flight program will help students earn flying hours, which can lead to a private pilot’s license with commercial flight training.\n“This program will not only help our school and the airport, but there will be a spotlight on Lake Charles, and people will want to come here for this program,” SOWELA Chancellor Neil Aspinwall said.\nChenault Executive Director Kevin Melton said programs like these are needed.\n“There’s a pilot shortage out there, and we want to help aid that. Getting these students into the flying is going to provide a faster and cheaper alternative for these students, and we can’t wait to see it in action,” Melton said.\nStudents at SOWELA are also excited to see their school growing. Aviation maintenance student Samuel Seabaugh said he is going to join the program.\n“I want to get my pilot’s license, and before this, there were no options in the area, so now I’m going to get out of the classroom and into the air,” Seabaugh said.\nThe flight center plans to have state-of-the-art simulators, an aviation hangar and meeting spaces. Construction will begin soon, and the program hopes to put students in the sky in early 2025.\nCopyright 2024 KPLC.
