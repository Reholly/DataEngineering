    "text": "Along with the reveal of the current-gen update for Fallout 4 finally landing this month, Bethesda has\ncontinued this week’s Fallout festivities with a week-long Fallout 76 freeplay period.\nIf the new Prime Video series has you hankering to tell your own stories out there in the Wasteland, you can download and play Fallout 76 for free, right now, on PlayStation, Xbox and PC, and play the game with no restrictions until next Friday, April 19th at 2AM AEDT. Anyone who’s an Amazon Prime member can also claim the Xbox or PC versions of Fallout 76 for free, forever,\nright here.\nAnd, should you want to continue your adventures, Fallout 76 is also deeply discounted for the week at up to 80% off across all platforms. You can find it at the below:\nAnd as if all of that isn’t enough, Bethesda’s also added some Vault 33-themed gear to the game including a free Vault 33 jumpsuit that can be claimed in the Atomic Store between now and May 7th along with a special Vault 33 Survival Kit that Game Pass Ultimate members can claim as a reward between now and June 16th.\nThe Vault 33 Survival Kit contains Lucy’s Vault 33 backpack from the Prime Video series along with some bonus consumable items and three S.C.O.R.E. boosters.\nFinally, Fallout 1st members can claim a West Coast Duster and Hat in the Atomic Shop between now and May 9th, so their vault dweller can rock the look of a certain Ghoul.\nThe full series of Fallout is\nout now on Prime Video.\nSet in Los Angeles a whole 200 years after a nuclear apocalypse, Fallout follows Lucy (played by Ella Purnell) as she steps out of Vault 33 into the unknown and unhinged world above.\n“Based on one of the greatest video game series of all time, Fallout is the story of haves and have-nots in a world in which there’s almost nothing left to have,” the show’s description reads.\n“200 years after the apocalypse, the gentle denizens of luxury fallout shelters are forced to return to the irradiated hellscape their ancestors left behind — and are shocked to discover an incredibly complex, gleefully weird and highly violent universe waiting for them.”\nYou can find out more about the show and how to watch it in our full guide\nhere, and read our review of the series here.",
