    "text": "ORLANDO, Fla. - Soarin&apos; is a Disney ride that sends guests on a flying journey around some of the world&apos;s best-known landmarks. Visitors experience the sights, sounds, and even smells of the voyage as they go. \"You load on the bottom level, everybody loads across and all of a sudden you&apos;re lifted up into the sky and put in front of a curved screen, and it puts you in that screen and up, down, left, right, all you see is what&apos;s projecting towards you, which is usually flying across the sky,\" said Matt Roseboom, editor of Attractions Magazine. The next time Disney, or another theme park, builds something like Soarin&apos;, this patent from Nashville-based Medici XD may be critical for giving visitors a realistic experience. The technology describes a multi-row seating apparatus, like the one Soarin&apos; uses, but takes it to a new, more extreme level. \"This looks very similar to Soarin&apos; but it has the ability to rock back-and-forth, pitch different directions, so there&apos;s a lot more motion involved in this new system,\" said Annie Wilson, with Universal Parks News Today. Theme park experts say - as with most patents - it may take years, if ever, for these new patents to be put into use at Orlando theme parks. Theme park expert Jason Diffendal from WDWNT.com said it would open up a Soarin&apos;-type ride to more adventurous possibilities. \"Disney is always researching new ideas in all kinds of things, including ride technology. This is sort of the next evolution in a Soarin&apos; ride system. Whether they&apos;re gonna implement this at Soarin,&apos; I don&apos;t think so, because Soarin&apos; is popular enough as it is.\"",
