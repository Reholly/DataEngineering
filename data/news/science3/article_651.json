This enlightening webinar co-hosted by Ashlee Hutchinson and Jun Wu will spotlight the revolutionary intersection of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), embryo models and genome engineering technologies with the noble cause of species preservation.\nAs our planet faces unprecedented biodiversity loss, this program will unveil how cutting-edge scientific advancements offer a lifeline for endangered species, allowing us to replicate and preserve the intricate tapestry of life that inhabits Earth. The webinar will explore the latest breakthroughs, ethical considerations, challenges, and future directions in the field, showcasing how these technologies not only deepen our understanding of biology but also equip us with the tools to combat extinction.\nOrganizers\nAshlee Hutchinson, PhD, Revive & Restore, Australia\nJun Wu, PhD, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, USA\nPresenters\nJef Boeke, PhD, NYU Langone Health, USA\nEriona Hysolli, PhD, Colossal Biosciences, USA\nNikki Traylor-Knowles, PhD, University of Miami, USA\nKatsuhiko Hayashi, PhD, Osaka University, Japan\nJeanne Loring, PhD, Scripps Research Institute, USA\nGabriela Mastromonaco, PhD, Toronto Zoo, Canada\nOliver Ryder, PhD, San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, USA\nJun Wu, PhD, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, USA\nQi-Long Ying, PhD, University of Southern California, USA\nThis webinar is free for anyone interested in species conservation and stem cells. Learn more and register . Media should contact kkilbourne@isscr.org for more information.\nAbout the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR.org)\nWith nearly 5,000 members from more than 70 countries, the International Society for Stem Cell Research is the preeminent global, cross-disciplinary, science-based organization dedicated to stem cell research and its translation to the clinic. The ISSCR mission is to promote excellence in stem cell science and applications to human health. Additional information about stem cell science is available AboutStemCells.org , an initiative of the Society to inform the public about stem cell research and its potential.\n###",
