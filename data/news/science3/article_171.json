    "text": "As workplaces in Canada have been reshaping from in-office to hybrid and remote environments,\nLAUFT, known for its flexible on-demand offices, has announced ambitious expansion plans, including a contract with the federal government of Canada.\nCurrently located in the Greater Toronto Area, LAUFT offers convenient and compact workspaces equipped with spaces to meet the needs from solo entrepreneurs to large corporations who are looking for flexible workplace solutions.\n“Really what we are looking at doing and really what we want, is to build the Starbucks of workspaces with an Uber-like experience”, shares\nGraham Wong, Founder and CEO of LAUFT. “In this evolving landscape, LAUFT is not just creating spaces; it is crafting experiences catering to the modern professional’s need for flexibility, innovation, and a work-life balance. As LAUFT expands its footprint, it brings us one step closer to a future where workplaces are as dynamic and diverse as the people who use them, offering a glimpse into a world where our environments are tailored not just for our tasks – but for our lifestyles.”\nCurrently the company has six locations including Vaughan, Burlington, Ajax, Castlefield, Dufferin, Don Mills, and King at Church in downtown Toronto. The company is planning to expand in the GTA and beyond, with a future site planned for Ottawa with a potential location in Oakville.\nThe space in Ottawa will be a pilot program aiming to introduce its flexible workplace environments to federal agencies, offering government employees a new way to work. Beyond these plans, LAUFT will be exploring opportunities throughout Canada and eventually will take its concept globally. The location in Oakville has not been confirmed, but Wong says he is hoping to open a space there for around September.\n“We are expanding and have a pipeline of more locations that extend all the way outside of the GTA in the commuter areas. We are also expanding into Ottawa where we won a contract with the federal government of Canada. We will be taking the LAUFT concept there as a pilot for their federal agencies and workers. From there, the vision extends across Canada. We see the value and demand for our model in providing flexible workspaces that cater to not just individual freelancers, but also to large organizations looking for adaptable solutions for their teams.”\nSpecialized spaces for events\nLAUFT will be expanding its King and Church location in Toronto and the additional space designed for meeting areas, workshops, professional and social gatherings, and provide parties.\n“We are expanding into the West unit, transforming it into a street-level space. This is about more than just providing space; it is about creating an experience that blends seamlessly with our vision of work and life.”\nThe new event space is scheduled to open in early May and Wong says it has the potential to be a landmark destination for professional and social events in downtown Toronto.\n“We need to look at space, and we need to figure out what people need. And what we saw and identified in the downtown core was an opportunity for event spaces. This is really just about how you can entertain and host larger groups in a space that is highly customizable, but very convenient and very accessible in the downtown core.Maybe it is for a book club, a wedding party, or maybe a sporting event. That hasn’t existed in a very on demand way and this is what we are bringing into the market.”\nThe new event space will be a test before expanding the concept to other locations.\nBlending travel and work\nLAUFT is aiming to be the “Starbucks of workspaces,” and would like to take the concept into airports, hotels, and globally.\nWong says he is exploring innovative venues that are not traditional office settings such as integrating flexible workspaces in airports and hotels. These locations will allow LAUFT to reach travelling professionals to work efficiently and comfortably while on the move.\n“Imagine having LAUFT in airports or travel hubs where between flights, professionals can catch up on work in a conducive environment, or hotels offering dedicated workspaces allowing guests to seamlessly blend travel and work. This vision represents a significant opportunity for LAUFT to embed itself into the fabric of the global business ecosystem.”\nWong also has plans to expand LAUFT internationally, such as in the US and Europe, but before this, he wants to establish a foundation in Canada. LAUFT is working with\nNick Iozzo from Savills Canada for their real estate search expansion needs.\nFuture plans\nAs the business is expanding its offerings into the Nation’s capital, Wong shared what’s to come for LAUFT.\n“The next step would likely be in Quebec and then we would love to go across Canada and then look into the US as that would probably be our second market.\nWong also said LAUFT is planning to bring back its loyalty program to enhance the user experience and foster a deeper sense of community. Wong says the company is working on rebuilding the loyalty program for guests, but is unsure when it will be available. The loyalty program Wong says is a great way to support local businesses, as it could possibly offer discounts to businesses around them such as cafes, restaurants, and retailers.\nCurrently, LAUFT already supports and promotes local businesses as it integrates local vendors and services into its workplaces, this loyalty program Wong says could be another way to interact with the community.\n“Our aim with revitalizing the loyalty program is not just about rewarding our users; it is about creating a thriving ecosystem where everyone benefits. By potentially offering discounts and special offers from nearby cafes, restaurants, and retailers, we are not only adding value for our members, but also driving meaningful support to local businesses. It is a tangible expression of our commitment to the communities we are part of and a reflection of our belief that when local businesses flourish, we all flourish.”",
