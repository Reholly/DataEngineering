    "text": "(WJAR) — Artificial intelligence is quickly transforming so many aspects of everyday life, including our smartphones. Believe it or not, AI has actually been a big part of our smartphones for years -- think of features like portrait mode, where it magically blurs the background of your photo. But, according to CNET Senior Mobile Editor Lisa Eadicicco, what we're seeing now is an [increase in generative AI features.](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/ai-is-changing-our-phones-and-its-just-getting-started/) “Generative AI is the type of AI that powers ChatGPT,” Eadicicco said. “It can provide an answer or create something in response to a prompt, and the way that we're seeing that in smartphones today is really through photo editing and some note taking features.” She continued, “So for example, both Samsung's new Galaxy S24 series and the Pixel 8 have features that can actually generate parts of a photo after you've removed an object to make it look more natural.” Eadicicco said there are also phones that can translate calls in different languages in real time. Over the coming years, she expects new features, powered by generative AI, to transform the way we use our phones. “One example of how we're kind of seeing that today in an early sense is a feature called ‘circle to search,’” Eadicicco said. “Now, this is pretty much exactly what it sounds like - on certain new Android phones - the Pixel 8 series, the Galaxy S24 series and some other phones from Samsung and Google - you can hold down the hold button and then circle almost anything on screen to launch a Google search for it.”' She said while that might not sound like a huge deal, it’s a new and different way of interacting with our phones. Eadicicco also talked about how increasing generative AI features on smartphones alter our current screen time habits. Right now, the average American spends an astonishing [4.5 hours a day on their phone](https://turnto10.com/i-team/consumer-advocate/screen-time-addiction-average-american-spends-four-hours-per-day-phone-younger-generation-reduce-laptops-notifications-january-22-2024) - and there's concern new, more appealing features will make the problem even worse. However, Eadicicco said there's also a chance that generative AI could eventually streamline the smartphone experience, so you don't open your phone to read an email and then feel compelled to open Facebook, and Instagram, and TikTok. But, like so many things in life, we'll have to wait and see.",
