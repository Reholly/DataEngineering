    "text": "Social media giant Meta has announced new tools to help protect young people from sextortion on its apps. It also encourages people to think before sending with a pop-up message reminding them of the risk of sending sensitive photos and directs them to online safety tips.The company is also aiming to prevent potential scammers from connecting with teenagers by developing technology to help identify accounts engaging in sextortion scams. And any message requests from potential sextortion accounts will go straight to the recipient's hidden requests folder. Sextortion is a form of blackmail where offenders coerce someone into sending intimate photos or videos of themselves online and then threaten to share them unless their demands are met. Ms Garlick said Meta was committed to working with local authorities including the Australian Federal Police and the Office of the eSafety Commissioner to remind young people of the dangers of sending intimate images online.An Australian boy took his own life in 2023 after he was the victim of alleged sextortion.He said the message to young people was they didn't need to suffer in silence.\\u003cbr\\u003e",
