    "text": "World’s First Subcutaneous Infliximab Celltrion announced on April 11 that “Zymfentra” (the U.S. brand name for Remsima), the world’s first subcutaneous formulation of infliximab for the treatment of autoimmune diseases developed in-house, has completed its formulation patent registration with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) on April 9, local time. Zymfentra is a treatment developed by Celltrion as a subcutaneous injection formulation of infliximab, a widely used intravenous form of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) inhibitor. It has been recognized for its efficacy and convenience in major global markets, including Europe, and was approved as a new drug by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last October, with market supply procedures underway since last month. The patent registered this time provides a barrier designed to defend against market entry by competitors’ SC formulation infliximab biosimilars, amid Celltrion’s launch of Zymfentra as a new drug in the U.S. market. This patent secures the exclusive rights to Zymfentra in the U.S. market until its expiration in 2038. The expectation is to receive patent protection until 2040 once the administration method patent, already applied for, is registered. Through the patent strategy for Zymfentra, Celltrion aims to establish a solid position in the U.S. market while generating stable mid-to-long-term profits by launching it as a new drug, which is priced higher compared to biosimilars. Previously, Celltrion secured patents for the Remsima formulation in Europe, Canada, Korea, Japan, Australia, Taiwan, and other key Asian countries. The importance of product protection in the market through patent registration is becoming increasingly recognized, and Celltrion plans to focus on securing global patent rights going forward. Specifically, in the U.S., which is the world’s largest market, the company intends to create a dense defensive barrier by securing multiple patent rights to block the entry of other companies into the market.
