    "text": "I read with great interest a letter in a newspaper the other day with the exciting topic: ‘Rediscovering the love of reading newspapers in the Digital Age’.\nThe young author, Ronald de Guzman Jr., outlines that news is everywhere and elsewhere from social media to websites, and asks: But does anyone still read newspapers in this digital age aside from the so-called “boomers”?\nAs I am a ‘boomer’ and as I am reading 4 newspapers a day and am writing weekly columns in two newspapers, I am certainly interested to hear from others how they feel about this exciting topic.\nLet me add, that I am also very much part of the digital world, hunting for special information in the Philippines and in the world. In other words, I am firmly of the opinion that people should read newspapers as hard copy and digitally.\nSomebody responded to my above question as follows:\nIn today’s fast-paced world, newspapers are facing exciting new challenges and opportunities as technology keeps evolving. The rise of the internet and digital media means that people now get their news online more than ever. So, how can newspapers adapt and thrive in this digital world?\nAlthough I only partly agree with the above opinion, let’s find out!\nGoing Online: The first step for newspapers is to embrace the internet. They can create websites and mobile apps to share news quickly with readers. This means you can check the latest updates wherever you are, right on your phone!\nI don’t agree because the printed newspaper delivers news, entertainment and lifestyle, opinion and editorials, and sport. You don’t want to miss that!!\nNews Just for You: Imagine getting news that matters to you the most, without having to search for it. Newspapers can use clever computer stuff to learn about your interests and show you news you’ll love. It’s like having your personalized newspaper!\nI want my personal newspaper in printed form, and I know exactly what to read!\nHow Do They Make Money? You might wonder how newspapers can survive if they’re putting news online for free. Well, they can offer some special content for those who subscribe, sort of like a membership. Also, they can have ads on their websites to help pay the bills.\nTrust Matters: In a world with so much information, it’s essential to know which news is reliable. Newspapers need to work hard to fact-check and provide accurate information. When you know you can trust a newspaper, you’ll keep coming back for more!\nTeaming Up for Success: Newspapers can join forces with other media and tech companies to do even better. By working together, they can share ideas, reach more people, and come up with creative solutions.\nBut people still need the printed edition every day!!!!\nIn conclusion, newspapers have a bright future ahead in the digital age. By going online, personalizing news, and using exciting content, they can stay connected with readers like never before. Remember, trustworthy news is essential, and newspapers are working hard to keep it that way. So, the next time you read a newspaper online, you’ll know they are embracing the change for the better!\nBut don’t forget the value of the printed daily newspaper that ‘flies’ into you house in the morning. I love that moment at 8 am and will never give it up!\nLet me finalize with the words of the author of the above-mentioned letter: “I remain eager to buy and read newspapers to ease my overreliance on digital media just like how I previously turned to digital to break my overreliance on newspapers.”\nIn other words: We need both!!! I really need your views; please email me at [email protected]",
