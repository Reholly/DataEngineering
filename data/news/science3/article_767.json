    "text": "DJI has made the Avata 2 FPV drone official today, and it's a rare case of being both better than\n[its predecessor](dji_unveils_avata_fpv_drone_with_propeller_guards_18minute_flight_time-news-55534.php), and cheaper. The new drone comes with improved image quality from a Super Wide angle 12 MP camera that uses a 1/1.3\" sensor, that has expanded dynamic range and much better handling of low-light scenarios since it can physically take in more light. The viewing angle is 155 degrees, and you can do HDR video at up to 4K 60fps, as well as slow-motion footage at 2.7K 120fps.\nThere are five more degrees of gimbal tilt (negative 85 degrees to 80 degrees). The maximum flight time has improved - now 23 minutes, and there's support for PD fast charging too. The new \"Two-Way Charging Hub\" has a power accumulation function which allows transferring the remaining power from multiple batteries to the one with the highest charge level to quickly supply more juice in critical moments.\nThe maximum video transmission distance is 13 km (3km more than in the original), with latency as low as 24ms, at 1080p 100fps with a maximum bitrate of 60Mbps. The drone is 28g lighter than its predecessor and its frame is 16mm shorter and 32mm wider, makign it more stable.\nThe new DJI Goggles 3, which let you see what the drone sees as it flies, can send the live feed from the drone to the DJI Fly app and transmit to another device up to 5m away. You can also use a cable to share the live feed to a display or another pair of Goggles 3 to share the excitement with those around you. The Goggles 3 have a built-in battery (with an extra hour of longevity added in for good measure) and GPS too, and dual 1080p, 700-nit micro-OLED displays. There's even a passthrough mode so you can look at your surroundings while flying.\nThe Avata 2 can store up to 90 minutes of 1080p 60fps video on its 46GB of internal storage, and you can quickly share your recordings via Wi-Fi to your smartphone.\nThe DJI Avata 2 with DJI Goggles 3 and DJI RC Motion 3 combo with a single battery is priced at $999. Adding two extra batteries, one Two-Way Charging Hub, and one sling bag makes the price $1,199. The DJI FPV Remote Controller retails for $199, and the Avata 2 ND Filters set is $79. If you just want the drone and nothing else, that will be $489.",
