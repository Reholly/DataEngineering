It's not just about being green; it's about saving green. In Kelowna, a quiet revolution is taking place on the rooftops of forward-thinking homeowners led by the solar pioneers at\nSkyFire Energy™. With over two decades of experience, SkyFire™ is making solar energy accessible and economically savvy for everyone.\nStacy Haakonson, VP RevOps and Employee Owner at SkyFire Energy™. shed light on how this innovation-driven company is changing the energy landscape in Kelowna. \"Solar energy is now within reach for homeowners, offering a way to lock in lower energy costs for decades,\" Stacy explains, emphasizing solar power's practical, wallet-friendly benefits.\nSkyFire Energy's™ story is one of pioneering spirit and innovation. \"We've been in business for 23 years, recognized as one of the OGs in solar in western Canada,\" Stacy shares with pride. Founded by David Kelly, a visionary who was the first to connect solar to the grid in his own home, SkyFire™ has grown from a Calgary startup to a major player in the solar industry with a branch in Kelowna for the past 15 years.\nThe push towards solar isn't just about future-proofing against rising energy costs; it's about taking advantage of today's technological advances and incentives. Stacy points out the immediate financial benefits, \"Adding solar to your home can reduce operating costs and potentially increase your home's value by up to 5%.\" And while the Greener Homes retrofit grant has expired, the Canadian government continues to support homeowners through the Greener Homes Loan.\nThis initiative offers zero-interest loans of up to $40,000 for homeowners looking to make energy-efficient upgrades, including solar panel installations. With a repayment term of up to 10 years, this loan makes solar energy and any energy retrofit, more accessible and financially viable for homeowners. \"It's a golden opportunity,\" Stacy adds, \"to invest in your future and take advantage of the financial support from the government, making now the ideal time to consider adding solar to your home.\"\nThis incentive lowers the upfront cost barrier and accelerates the return on investment, making solar a smart economic choice for Canadians today. Even without incentives, solar still makes financial sense and SkyFire Energy™ can help you determine your own projected payback period.\nWhen considering solar energy, it's natural to have questions and concerns about its practicality and benefits. Stacy Haakonson directly addresses these, offering clear, fact-based insights. \"Many homeowners ask about the payback period wondering if the savings on energy bills justify the initial outlay. The financial benefits of solar energy are becoming more apparent and attainable sooner than you might think thanks to advancements in technology, more affordable product options, accessible financial incentives, and, depending on the province, rate switching or time-of-day energy rate options, she explains.\nAnother common question revolves around how solar energy works, especially outside of sunny hours. Stacy clarifies, \"Solar panels are designed to maximize energy production, and any surplus generated during peak sunlight is not lost. Instead, it's fed back into the electrical grid, effectively reducing your utility costs through credits. \"Net metering\" ensures that your investment continues to pay off, regardless of the time of day.\" This combination of factors has positioned solar energy as a savvy, efficient choice for homeowners, addressing the practical considerations every homeowner weighs.\nSkyFire's™ dedication to the community and the planet is evident in their Zero Carbon Solar offering and their role in significant projects like the District of Summerland Utility-Scale project. \"We purchase carbon offsets for every home and some commercial projects we install solar on,\" Stacy notes, underscoring SkyFire's™ commitment to a zero-carbon footprint. As a certified B Corporation,SkyFire™ holds itself accountable for transparency in its social and environmental practices, which builds consumer trust and loyalty and places higher value on more than just financial performance.\nOpting for SkyFire Energy™ means more than just going solar; it's choosing a partner committed to delivering economic value and reliability. With a focus on customer education and sustainable practices, SkyFire™ stands out as a wise choice for homeowners looking to make a smart investment in their future.\nAs Kelowna grows, the opportunity for solar energy to contribute to the community's economic resilience becomes increasingly evident. SkyFire Energy™ is at the forefront, ready to guide homeowners and builders toward a more sustainable and financially sound future.\nIf you get value from KelownaNow and believe local independent media is important to our community we ask that you please consider subscribing to our daily newsletter.\nIf you appreciate what we do, we ask that you consider\nsupporting our local independent news platform.",
