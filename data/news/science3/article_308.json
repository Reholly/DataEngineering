    "text": "PITTSBURGH , April 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- \"I'm a teacher and I thought there could be a better marker that wouldn't dry out and would allow you to use every last drop of ink,\" said an inventor, from Noblesville, Ind., \"so I invented the BRUCE LIQUID WASHABLE MARKERS. My design would also allow you to easily tell how much ink is left.\"\nThe patent-pending invention provides an improved design for felt-tip markers. In doing so, it offers an alternative to standard markers with a felt storage medium. As a result, it prevents the marker from drying out, even if the cap is left off, and it eliminates the need to prematurely discard and replace markers. The invention features a simple design that is easy to use so it is ideal for households, children, teachers, office workers, etc. Additionally, it is producible in a variety of sizes and colors.\nThe original design was submitted to the Indianapolis sales office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
