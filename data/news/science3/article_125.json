    "text": "– Presentations include data from an expanded group of older patients treated with Orca Bio’s investigational high-precision cell therapy, Orca-T, and reduced intensity conditioning – MENLO PARK, Calif.--( BUSINESS WIRE )-- Orca Bio, a late-stage biotechnology company developing high-precision cell therapies for the treatment of cancer, autoimmune diseases and genetic blood disorders, today announced new data will be presented during the 50th Annual Meeting of the EBMT in Glasgow, United Kingdom. Specifically, results from a single-center open-label Phase 1 clinical trial of an expanded group of older patients (n=20) treated with Orca Bio’s lead investigational high-precision cell therapy, Orca-T, and a reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen will be presented. Preliminary data with Orca-T and RIC in patients with hematologic malignancies showed encouraging rates of relapse-free survival (77%). With a median follow-up of 9.65 months, no patients have experienced relapse to date (0%), demonstrating the curative potential for Orca-T in this historically challenging to treat patient group. An earlier dataset evaluating Orca-T and RIC in this population was presented at the 2023 American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting. A second presentation will highlight findings from a non-randomized retrospective analysis comparing Orca-T plus single-agent tacrolimus with a standard of care allogeneic stem cell transplant (alloHSCT) plus post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy)-based graft versus host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis in patients with hematologic malignancies receiving myeloablative conditioning (MAC). When compared to the historical PTCy cohort in this patient population, Orca-T offered potentially favorable rates of relapse-free survival, non-relapse mortality and overall survival. These data were previously presented at the 2024 Tandem Meetings, Transplantation & Cellular Therapy Meetings of the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) and the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR). “At Orca Bio, we continue to build clinical evidence to support the profile of Orca-T and its potential to expand life-saving treatment to patients while also reducing treatment-related risks,” said Scott McClellan, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer at Orca Bio. “We look forward to joining top healthcare professionals from around the world at EBMT and sharing the latest findings that support the potential for Orca-T to offer a new curative solution for providers and their patients.” The EBMT abstracts are available at https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmt.org%2F&esheet=53928290&newsitemid=20240411207001&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmt.org%2F&index=1&md5=b431b31b5c5e1d74c4f99b8149d41a18.
