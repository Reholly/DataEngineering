    "text": "According to Crypto Koryoâ€™s Dune data, BRC-20 emerged as the top-performing crypto narrative last month (MTD).\nOrdinals scored 40.62% in this ranking , securing the top position. Account Abstraction followed closely behind, with 17.69%, and LSD L2 took third place with 17.05%.\nA performance of crypto narratives during MTD. Source: Dune BRC-20 vs ERC-20 With the introduction of the BRC-20 standard, the Bitcoin blockchain has expanded its capabilities to include non-fungible tokens (NFTs) .\nIn Q4, the blockchain surged ahead in sales volume , surpassing Ethereum with $1.27 billion compared to $881 million in organic volume, as reported by Coin98.\nA list of blockchains by sale volume in NFT. Source: Coin98 Analytics Fresh data from CryptoSlam further underscores the popularity of Bitcoin ordinals. According to the aggregator, the Uncategorized Ordinals collection holds the top spot in terms of sales volume over the past 24 hours.\nSales increased by 49.09% to $10.8 million, while the number of transactions increased by 71.94% to 12,115.\nOnce again, collections on the Bitcoin blockchain claimed the top two spots in this ranking. $PUPS BRC-20 NFTs secured second place, followed by NodeMonkes in third place.\nBRC-20 leads among NFT collections in sales volume over the last 24 hours. Source: CryptoSlam CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club, previously dominant in the NFT space , have slipped to 8th and 9th place, respectively.\nFor instance, CryptoPunks saw sales totaling $778,414, a nearly 93% decrease compared to Uncategorized Ordinals.\nBRC-20 Outlook According to Dune statistics , Bitcoin Ordinals is one of the few crypto narratives exhibiting positive momentum.\nIn contrast, other narratives have experienced declines. For instance, the Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) dropped by 13.08% in MTD performance, while real-world assets (RWA) lost 14.54%.\nDecentralized exchanges (DEX) led the anti-growth trend. However, NFTs in this ranking experienced a smaller decline of 5.27%. This could suggest a potential market revival fueled by Bitcoin ordinals.",
