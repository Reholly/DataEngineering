This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240411765198/en/ (Graphic: Business Wire) \"xeo® has played a pivotal role in the history of Cutera and I’m proud to be a part of that legacy with the launch of xeo+,” said Michael Karavitis, Ph.D., Executive Vice President, Chief Technology Officer, Cutera. “We developed an innovation inspired by the modern aesthetic practice building upon the over 20-year heritage of xeo. The new xeo+ seamlessly blends versatility and cutting-edge technology to meet the ever-evolving demands of thriving practices and we are confident that xeo+ will surpass our customers' expectations and set a new standard of excellence in the industry.” Introduced in 2003, xeo pioneered Nd:YAG laser technology as the first 1064 nm laser with contact cooling. Its traction increased with the inclusion of the signature Laser Genesis™ treatment, an exclusive 15-minute skin revitalization treatment for all skin types that utilizes proprietary micropulses to stimulate the skin. Laser Genesis helped to raise the bar for no-downtime treatment protocols and has been widely popular amongst thousands of xeo providers and patients worldwide. Cutera continues to set industry milestones with the modernized xeo+, designed to deliver a more streamlined approach to aesthetics with faster treatment times, an intuitive user interface and a host of features for an elevated provider and patient experience. The technology is enhanced with larger spot size options and upgraded contact cooling for improved comfort, resulting in faster Laser Genesis™ treatments and allowing practitioners to perform hair removal treatments two times faster than before. The technology also includes a versatile range of newly redesigned laser and IPL handpieces, ranging from the CoolView®, Limelight®, Prowave, and Acutip™. “The original xeo has been a steadfast platform in my practice from the beginning,” said Dr. Mira Kaga, founder of The Kaga Institute of Medicine and Aesthetics. “The enhancements of the xeo+ have allowed me to treat faster and more efficiently, helping to streamline my operations even more and improve ROI. This technology offers a wide range of solutions and is designed to be intuitive, making it suitable for users of all experience levels.” Addressing the most popular aesthetic concerns, xeo+ offers over 25 solutions for skin revitalization, hair removal, vascular, pigment reduction, and more. The flexibility and customization of applications allow practices the opportunity to widen their patient demographic and evolve with the demands and needs of their patients. xeo+ is currently available to physicians throughout the US and Canada.
