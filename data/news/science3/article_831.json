It also delves deeper into the comparison between the Subaru Legacy and its competitors.\nSummary\n- Subaru Legacy saw a 12.9% increase in sales in 2023 after a mid-cycle refresh, boasting a more aggressive exterior and advanced driver aids.\n- Two engine options available, 2.4L turbo for brisk acceleration and 2.5L for better fuel economy; both paired with symmetrical all-wheel drive.\n- Substantial interior space, advanced safety features, and competitive pricing make the Legacy stand out in the mid-size sedan segment.\nIn a mid-size sedan class that has a slew of brilliant offerings, it’s easy to ignore an old-timer like the\nSubaru Legacy, a nameplate that debuted in the United States in 1990. Outshone by the impressive Outback, Crosstrek, and Forester models, the Legacy is one of the least popular Subaru models Stateside. However, Legacy sales improved in 2023: the automaker reported that by the end of 2023, it had recorded a 12.9 percent increase in Legacy sales compared to 2022.\nThe current Legacy generation debuted in 2019 and received a mid-cycle refresh for 2023. The Japanese automaker updated the car’s look and improved the model’s already impressive suite of driver aids. The refresh perhaps explains the uptick in Subaru Legacy sales. Here’s all you need to know about this hidden gem in the mid-size sedan segment.\nUPDATE: 2024/04/11\nThis update provides more information about the Subaru Legacy's trims and safety ratings, detailing the sedan's performance in crash safety tests. It also delves deeper into the comparison between the Subaru Legacy and its competitors.\n[ ](/the-mid-size-sedan-that-deserves-more-attention/)\nAn often overlooked model in the crowded mid-size sedan segment, here's why you shouldn't ignore the value-packed Nissan Altima\n[ The Mid-Size Sedan That Deserves More Attention ](/the-mid-size-sedan-that-deserves-more-attention/)\nIn order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from Subaru and other authoritative sources, including Car And Driver.\nSubaru Offers A Turbo And Non-Turbo Engine With the Legacy\nSubaru offers two engines with the Legacy: a 2.4-liter turbocharged flat-four and a naturally aspirated 2.5-liter boxer. The 2.5-liter power unit premiered in the 2019 Forester with nearly all of its parts new.\nThe 2.4-liter Turbo Engine Delivers Brisk Acceleration\nThe Subaru Legacy is not a performance sedan, and it doesn’t pretend to be one. Nevertheless, if performance matters to you, you should opt for the 2.4-liter turbo engine, which comes standard in the Sport and Touring XT trims. It\ngets the Touring XT variant to 60 MPH in 6.1 seconds; the lighter Sport trim takes 5.7 seconds to complete the dash to 60 MPH. During everyday driving, the turbo’s extra thrust may come in handy when overtaking.\nPaired with its standard symmetrical all-wheel drive, a Subaru hallmark, the automaker hypes up the handling characteristics of the current-gen Legacy, claiming the car’s stiffer construction improves cornering. The Legacy lies in an\noptimized version of the Subaru Global Platform, which Subaru claims is 70 percent stiffer in torsional rigidity and 100 percent stiffer in front and rear rigidity compared to the previous generation’s platform.\nThe added stiffness comes from the increased use of high-strength steel and structural adhesive. Subaru alleges that thanks to the new platform, a lower center of gravity, and strengthened suspension (MacPherson struts in the front; double-wishbone layout in the rear), the Legacy is more responsive to steering inputs and a better performer through corners.\nPerformance Specifications\nEngine\nTurbocharged 2.4-liter flat-four\n| |\nNaturally aspirated 2.5-liter flat-four\nHorsepower\n260 horsepower\n| |\n182 horsepower\nTorque\n277 pound-feet\n| |\n176 pound-feet\nTransmission\nCVT\n| |\nCVT\nDriveline\nAWD\n| |\nAWD\nFuel Economy (cmb/city/hwy)\n26/23/31 MPG\n| |\n30/27/35 MPG\n0-60 MPH\n6.1 seconds\n| |\n8.0 seconds\nTop Speed\n149 MPH\n| |\n139 MPH\n(Source: Subaru)\nThe 2.5-liter Engine Is More Economical\nCompared to the turbo, the 2.5-liter engine, which comes as standard in the Base, Premium, and Limited trims, delivers lackluster acceleration: it motivates the Legacy to 60 MPH in 8.0 seconds. It won’t instill you with confidence when gearing up to overtake. Both engines send power to all wheels through a CVT gearbox,\nwhich is more efficient at transferring energy than the previous generation’s CVT.\nThe naturally aspirated boxer engine claws back some pride when considering fuel efficiency. The EPA claims that, on average,\nit consumes a gallon of fuel every 30 miles. In contrast, the turbocharged power unit consumes a similar amount of gas every 26 miles. As per the EPA, variants with the 2.5-liter engine have a range of 555 miles on a full tank, while trims with the turbocharged power unit can only do 481 miles on a full tank of gas. [ ](/mid-size-honda-accord-that-is-a-factory-sleeper/)\nWhile the trusty Honda Accord is your average forgettable commuter, for a small window of time, things got a lot more interesting with the 2.0T\n[ What Makes This Humble Mid-Size Family Sedan A Quintessential Factory Sleeper ](/mid-size-honda-accord-that-is-a-factory-sleeper/)\nThe Legacy Features A Sporty Exterior And A Spacious Interior\nSubaru offers five Legacy trims, all featuring a handsome exterior and a spacious interior. The bottom trim, dubbed Base, is the cheapest and least equipped, while the top trim, dubbed the Touring XT, is the heaviest, most expensive, and most well-equipped model in the lineup.\n2024 Subaru Legacy Price\n|Trim||Price|\n|Base||$24,895|\n|Premium||$27,195|\n|Limited||$31,945|\n|Sport||$34,495|\n|Touring XT||$38,195|\nSubaru Gave The Legacy A More Aggressive Exterior During The Mid-cycle Refresh\nSubaru redesigned the Legacy’s front fascia for 2023, installing redesigned LED headlights and a bigger grille. The refresh gave the Legacy, with its wide fenders, frameless grille, and raised trunk surface, a more aggressive stance. Subaru redesigned the exterior side-view mirrors to increase aerodynamic efficiency and reduce cabin noise, to distinguish between the different variants.\nThe Base trim has black side mirrors; the Premium and Limited trims have body-color side mirrors; the Sport trim features side mirrors with a magnetic gray metallic finish; the top-rated Touring XT variant features satin chrome finished side mirrors. Also, the mid-range Sport and top-ranked Touring XT trims have dual exhaust outlets; the bottom three models have single exhaust outlets.\nSport Trim Offers The Best Value For Money\nThe Sport trim triumphs over the other variants when considering value for money. For starters, it unlocks the more potent turbocharged four-port and has considerably more standard features than the Limited, despite the relatively low difference in price between the two trims, including a power moonroof, a trunk spoiler, a heated steering wheel, and a distraction mitigation system. The Limited, which skews more toward luxury than sportiness, features leather upholstery, power-adjustable front seats, and heated rear seats.\nThe Legacy Features A Spacious Interior And Plenty Of Driver Aids\nThe new-gen Legacy is more spacious than the previous-gen model. It offers 105.5 cubic feet of passenger volume (104 cubic feet with moonroof installed) and 15.1 cubic feet of trunk space. The rear seats fold flat to free up more room for cargo. Subaru offers cloth, leather, and Nappa leather upholstery with the Legacy, depending on the trim you choose.\nThe base model features dual 7.0-inch displays, while all other models have Subaru’s 11.6-inch STARLINK infotainment screen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration. The vertical style screen dominates the unremarkable but well-finished dashboard. It controls a considerable number of functions, including navigation and climate settings.\nThe Legacy's Platform Is Optimized For Crash Protection\nSubaru has long been a leader when it comes to vehicle safety,\na trend that continues with the 2024 Subaru Legacy: all Legacy models come with an updated version of the Japanese automaker’s EyeSight suite of driver aids. The Legacy sedan lies on a platform optimized for crash absorption and rigidity. In the event of a crash, eight standard airbags reduce the likelihood of passenger injury. Subaru's sedan was an IIHS Top Safety Pick for 18 years until it dropped out in 2024. Still, the Legacy performed well during its evaluation by the IIHS.\nDriver aids provide an additional layer of protection for the vehicle's occupants and other road users. For instance, automatic emergency steering and blind-spot detection work together to help avoid a potential collision with an obstacle or at speeds lower than 50 MPH. Adaptive cruise control with lance centering gently recenters the car inside a lane when the system detects that the driver is veering towards another lane.\nSubaru Legacy Standard Driver Aids\n- Adaptive cruise control\n- Lane departure warning\n- Automated emergency braking\n- High beam assist\n- Automatic emergency steering\n- Lane keep assist\n[ ](/reasons-why-the-toyota-camry-remains-a-popular-mid-size-sedan-in-2023/)\nDespite the rise in the popularity of SUVs, find out why the Toyota Camry remains one of the most popular cars on the road today\n[ 10 Reasons Why The Toyota Camry Remains A Popular Mid-Size Sedan In 2023 ](/reasons-why-the-toyota-camry-remains-a-popular-mid-size-sedan-in-2023/)\nComparison With The Toyota Camry and Honda Accord\nTwo of the stars of the overpopulated mid-sized sedan segment are the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord. The Legacy is the only one of the three that comes standard with all-wheel drive, a helpful feature, in areas that experience conditions are far from ideal. However, the Camry and Accord also have handy tricks of their own.\nToyota Offers A Hybrid Powertrain With The Camry\nToyota offers a wide variety of engines with the outgoing Camry, including a hybrid powertrain and a 3.5-liter V-6. The 301-horsepower V-6 is the sporty version, while\nthe hybrid powertrain is the most economical; the EPA gives it an average fuel economy rating of 52 MPG. The non-hybrid 2.5-liter engines are remarkably frugal, consuming a gallon of fuel every 32 miles in the LE and SE variants. AWD Camry models are thirstier than rear-wheel drive variants. Both cars feature extensive lists of standard safety and driver-assistance features.\nThe Honda Accord Is Pricier And Only Comes With Front Wheel Drive\nThe base Honda Accord costs about $3,000 more than the base Subaru Legacy. However, it features a more potent turbocharged engine and a plush, modern-looking exterior. All Accord variants come with a front-wheel drive and a CVT gearbox. Like Toyota, Honda offers a hybrid powertrain with its mid-sized Sedan offering. Consisting of two electric motors and a 2.0-liter inline-four, it produces a combined 204 horsepower,\nenough to get the Accord to 60 MPH in 6.5 seconds.\nPerformance Comparison\nModel\n2024 Subaru Legacy Sport\n2024 Toyota Camry TRD\n| |\n2024 Honda Accord Sport Hybrid\nEngine\nTurbocharged 2.4-liter flat-four\n3.5-liter V-6\n| |\n2.0-liter inline-four hybrid\nHorsepower\n260 horsepower\n301 horsepower\n| |\n204 horsepower\nTorque\n277 pound-feet\n267 pound-feet\n| |\n247 pound-feet\nTransmission\nCVT\nEight-speed automatic\n| |\nCVT\nDriveline\nAWD\nFWD\n| |\nFWD\nFuel Economy (cmb/city/hwy)\n26/23/31 MPG\n25/22/31 MPG\n| |\n48/51/44 MPG\n0-60 MPH\n6.1 seconds\n5.8 seconds\n| |\n6.5 seconds\nTop Speed\n149 MPH\n134 MPH\n| |\n125 MPH\nMSRP\n$34,495\n$33,485\n| |\n$32,895\n(Specs: Subaru, Toyota, Honda)\n[ ](/cheapest-mid-size-luxury-sedan-on-sale-today/)\nDrumming in at $ 40,050, the Acura TLX offers affordable luxury and value while maintaining athletic performance capabilities\n[ The Cheapest Mid-Size Luxury Sedan On Sale Today ](/cheapest-mid-size-luxury-sedan-on-sale-today/)\nFinal Thoughts On The Subaru Legacy\nThe Subaru Legacy is a brilliant mid-size sedan that perhaps suffers from the lack of a hybrid powertrain. Of the two engines offered, the more powerful turbocharged engine is the better option. The extra oomph provided by the turbo adds to the excitement of driving the rather understated Legacy.\nIt is less economical than the naturally aspirated 2.5-liter engine, but not by much. Standard all-wheel drive (one of the very best in the class, this side of Audi's Quattro system), active torque vectoring,\na plush and comfortable ride, a generous offering of standard driver aids and an affordable starting MSRP, make the Legacy an attractive option in the mid-size sedan segment. However, the fuel economy of competitors with hybrid powertrains reduces its desirability.",
