    "text": "According to the CDC , 1 in 3 Americans have prediabetes and more than 80% don’t even realize it. For many of those Americans, prediabetes can develop into type 2 diabetes within 5 years.\nIn its continuing effort to provide preventative health solutions, Noom recently launched a Diabetes Prevention Program , which is designed to support those at risk for type 2 diabetes.\nNoom Diabetes Prevention Program Noom's Diabetes Prevention Program aims to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes by helping users develop healthier habits.\nLearn more about the Noom Diabetes Prevention Program What is type 2 diabetes? Type 2 diabetes is a health condition that affects 90 to 95% of the 38 million Americans living with diabetes, characterized by high level of sugar (glucose) in the blood. It occurs when when your body can’t use insulin properly, a hormone that regulates blood glucose, resulting in hyperglycemia, or high blood sugar. Chronic hyperglycemia can cause damage to nerves, blood vessels, and organs, and lead to serious health conditions.\nCan you reverse type 2 diabetes? While there is no cure for type 2 diabetes, there are ways to prevent or delay it with lifestyle changes like eating a healthier diet and exercising regularly, even if you're at high risk.\nWhat is a Diabetes Prevention Program? A Diabetes Prevention Program is a partnership of public and private organizations that work to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes. The programs allow people at risk for type 2 diabetes to engage in evidence-based lifestyle change programs meant to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.\nWhat to know about the Noom Diabetes Prevention Program Credit: Noom Noom's new Diabetes Prevention Program is one of just 11 digital programs with a CDC Full Plus Recognition.\nIt's a CDC-recognized DPP program The Noom Diabetes Prevention Program is a CDC-recognized Diabetes Prevention Program that's earned a CDC Full Plus Recognition , which is the highest honor, and it's one of just 11 digital programs nationwide to receive this recognition. With the new program, Noom is committed to providing sustainable solutions for diabetes prevention through improved eating habits, physical activity, stress management, emotional eating, sleep hygiene, and more.\nIt helps you create a diabetes meal plan Every time users log into the Noom app, their information will automatically be shared with their personal Diabetes Prevention Program coach who will continually monitor their progress. The coach will use their health information to guide them in making healthier eating choices by balancing their eating plan. The Diabetes Prevention Program coach will be a partner on the challenging but rewarding path to a healthier and happier lifestyle.\nIt's a 12-month plan Noom's Diabetes Prevention Program is meant to be a 12-month plan that's broken down into two essential periods: months 1-6 and months 7-12. The first six months will focus on nutrition and physical activity with weekly communications with a Diabetes Prevention Program coach, while the last six months will involve in-depth behavioral topics like stress, sleep, and emotional eating with support from your coach and group.\nOver 12 months, users should move through four key stages: learning, practice, advanced learning, and mastery. They'll have access to various resources on their journey that include easy-to-follow tasks, progress monitoring, inspiring feedback, and individualized support. Each day will begin with a simple plan with a customized list of steps to help them reach their goal. They'll also have Noom's innovative technology, predictive algorithms, and intuitive food portions at their disposal.\nLearn about the Noom Diabetes Prevention Program\nRelated content feature Seasonal allergies stink—find out if this nasal spray can help review Reebok NanoX4 review",
