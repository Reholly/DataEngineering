    "text": "Fidelity Investments\nintroduces three actively managed liquid alternatives ETFs: Fidelity Dynamic Buffered Equity ETF (FBUF), Fidelity Hedged Equity ETF (FHEQ), and Fidelity Yield Enhanced Equity ETF (FYEE). The ETFs are designed to match the growing number of clients seeking downside protection and higher income within the equity markets.\nAn experienced group of people manages each fund which pairs a traditional U.S. equity approach with a tailored option overlay that minimizes risk or accrues profits. Fidelity unveils a series of disruptive ETFs that provide innovative strategies to investors who want to surmount market volatility and optimize their portfolios.\nFBUF incorporates the sales of call options and purchase of puts simultaneously thus establishing a strategy within the options space that allows them to ease risk.FHEQ aims to smooth out market ups and downs by purchasing put options, which help protect against drops in the underlying assetâ€™s value.\nFYEE prides itself on having a scheme that gives its attractive distribution yields which are dynamic. Achieving this goal becomes possible with these strategies in place that offer investors different ways of dealing with the risk.\n[Also read:] [Fidelity Ventures into Spot Ethereum ETF with Staking Feature]",
