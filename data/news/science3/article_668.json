    "text": "Summary - Pokémon Legends: Arceus stands out with an impressive Metascore of 83, while Scarlet and Violet score lower at 71 on the Nintendo Switch. - Arceus reinvents the typical Pokémon game with a focus on the Pokédex and world history, shaking up the series convention. - Z-A has the potential to refine Arceus and Pokémon X and Y , introducing new mechanics like city building and improving gameplay. Which [Pokémon](https://www.cbr.com/tag/pokemon/) game is the worst and why will differ between anyone you ask, but when it comes to reviews, the Switch era has had a rough time. Of Pokémon's mainline Nintendo Switch releases, the game with the highest Metascore is Pokémon Legends: Arceus with an 83, and the game with the lowest is Violet at 71. Two of the Switch pairs, Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, as well as Scarlet and Violet, are currently the lowest-scoring main series Pokémon games on Metacritic. Though the Switch era of Pokémon has been swimming in controversy, one game managed to shock players and critics by shaking the series up: Pokémon Legends: Arceus. Arceus was a surprisingly fun reinvention of the typical Pokémon game, if technically unimpressive even by the Switch's standards. While it wasn't the first game to ditch the Gym Challenge, its focus on the Pokédex and development of the Pokémon world's history made it stand out. After 25 years of defeating the Champion to become the very best, Arceus ditched the Pokémon League altogether in favor of catching 'em all. Now that Pokémon Legends: Z-A has been announced, the second Legends game has the potential to refine the best parts of Arceus and Pokémon X and Y to create [a new foundation for Pokémon games going forward](https://www.cbr.com/pokemon-mainline-games-legends-arceus-gameplay-new-standard/). How Hisui Succeeded Where Paldea Failed [ ](/pokemon-scarlet-violet-paradox-largest-missed-opportunities/) The Paradox Pokémon were fancy new additions to the roster in the Gen IX games Scarlet & Violet, but how could they have been even better? [ The Biggest Missed Opportunities of the Paradox Pokémon ](/pokemon-scarlet-violet-paradox-largest-missed-opportunities/) Scarlet and Violet are notorious for presentation and gameplay issues. Arceus is a more stable product, but it also managed to handle exploration better than the Paldea games despite not having an open world like them. While Hisui is far from a bustling society, the narrative justifies the lack of NPCs outside of Jubilife Village by setting the game during Hisui's colonization. The more streamlined system that lets the player catch Pokémon without engaging them in a battle first makes filling the Pokédex more fun: while the player is free to approach the Pokémon in a standard encounter and lower their HP, they can also try sneaking up on it and using non-battle items to distract or stun it before throwing the ball. Scarlet and Violet had overworld encounters where players could sneak up on Pokémon too, but the need to switch into a battle to catch the Pokémon would bring the momentum of open-world roaming to a screeching halt. Paldea is still fun to explore, but Hisui provides a much smoother experience. If it makes things easier for Game Freak and means the return of Arceus' catching system, having multiple separate but large maps rather than one singular huge map would be a great choice for Z-A. When it came to battling, some of Arceus' greatest moments were the Noble Pokémon battles. Serving as Arceus' closest replacement for the Gym Challenge, the Noble Pokémon were bosses that didn't just test the player's Pokémon, but the player themselves. Instead of facing off against them in a turn-based battle, the player would have to dodge the Noble's attacks in real-time while throwing special medicine to subdue them. There's occasionally a chance to send out a Pokémon to try and wear out the Noble a little faster, but most of the experience would involve dodging the angry Pokémon's attacks. The Noble Pokémon were fun to take on, but [the difficulty spike that accompanied them](https://www.cbr.com/pokemon-games-gens-difficulty-ranked/) was sometimes more of a design issue than a player skill issue. Sometimes the arenas weren't wide enough to easily dodge in, or the player only being able to take a few hits made it too easy to lose. Z-A could have its own version of Noble Pokémon battles, but also revamp the arenas and give the ability to upgrade the player character's HP to make things more manageable. What Z-A Can Improve Upon From Arceus [ ](/young-pokemon-trainer-downside/) The life of a Pokémon Trainer has often been depicted as glamorous and full of adventure. However, one manga showed that this isn't always the case. [ This Pokémon Manga Shows The Dark Side Of Becoming A Child Pokémon Trainer ](/young-pokemon-trainer-downside/) There's plenty of speculation on what Z-A will take from Arceus, but since Arceus is the only Legends game so far, there's not a lot of solid precedent to base Z-A theories on. A pattern isn't a pattern if it only happens once. While it'd be great to see things like the boss battles and catching system from Arceus return in Z-A, it'd be even better if traditional series mechanics like abilities and online battling returned with them. Imagine the potential of Arceus' strong and agile style moves combined with abilities and Mega Evolution online; the meta would either collapse or ascend from the potential new strategies. If Game Freak decides against making Z-A a more competitive game, there's still plenty of potential for it in other areas. The battle system in Arceus was fine, but there was a much bigger focus on catching Pokémon. Z-A might follow in its footsteps by putting more of the spotlight on a non-battle mechanic. Maybe the focus will be on filling the Pokédex again, but it could be something completely different. What if Contests make a major return since they were referenced at the end of Arceus' \"Daybreak\" update? What if they bring in completely new mechanics like resource management and city building? It's the \"Lumiose City Redevelopment Plan,\" after all. Whether Z-A takes place in the past or the future, something major is being built in Lumiose City. It'd be the perfect chance to bring in a city building mechanic. Of course, less can be more. If the game steers too far and puts too much investment into something that Pokémon isn't known for, it could result in a disjointed gameplay experience. Pokémon is in a precarious position, balancing right on the line between \"too safe and stale\" and \"too risky and different.\" However, the nature of Pokémon as hyper-intelligent superpowered animals that live alongside humans allows for them to be used in many different roles without being too jarring. Spin-off games like Pokémon Café ReMix and the Detective Pikachu duology showcase this with many different Pokémon who don't battle. The two main anime series are even better — Orla using a Metagross to help with her mechanic duties and Murdock using his Alcremie when he cooks in [Pokémon Horizons: The Series](https://www.cbr.com/pokemon-horizons-rising-volts-explained/) are recent examples. Picking Up On Old Plot Points [ ](/pokemon-game-for-older-audiences/) Pokémon has captured the hearts of kids for over a quarter-century, but what would it look like if they made a T-rated Pokémon game? [ How Would a Pokémon Game for Older Audiences Look? ](/pokemon-game-for-older-audiences/) One of the most exciting things about Z-A is its return to Kalos. Pokémon X and Y were very impressive graphically for the mainline games' first venture into 3D and introduced the beloved Mega Evolution mechanic, but they were criticized for feeling unfinished and being much easier than previous games. It wasn't that they were glitchy or bad-looking, but rather that there were elements that were never explored in much depth or ever followed up on. [AZ, the Pokémon War](https://www.cbr.com/pokemon-x-y-dark-lore/), and Zygarde were the biggest missed opportunities in Kalos. While AZ's story plays a major role in Kalos' history, it feels so disconnected from the main plot that most people forgot about it. Zygarde was a Legendary Pokémon meant to round out a trio with Xerneas and Yveltal, who were on the boxes of their own games but never got a game of their own to headline. This was especially egregious since Zygarde was a major focus in the Pokémon the Series: XY arc of the anime. Z-A, from its name alone, can be assumed to feature both AZ and Zygarde in some capacity: AZ is Z-A obviously backward, and Zygarde comes to mind because it's a Kalos game that has a \"Z\" in the title. If Z-A decides to go into Kalos' backstory like Arceus did with Sinnoh, then AZ's reign and the Pokémon War would be a goldmine of storytelling to pull from. In X and Y, all the player is told about the Pokémon War is that AZ, the old king of Kalos, used a weapon powered by the box Legendary and the lives of dead Pokémon to first bring his Floette back to life and then to end the war by causing a calamity. What caused the war besides \"people suck\" is never explained, but it must have been bad if the king's own Pokémon was forcibly drafted. Could Zygarde have had something to do with it? Most of its Pokédex entries describe it as some kind of guardian of the ecosystem, so after AZ used the weapon, did Zygarde do anything? These are all great questions that the player could witness the answers to rather than just be told about. [ ](/is-mewtwo-strongest-pokemon/) Mewtwo was known for being Pokémon's strongest creature at the franchise's start, but how does it compare to new Legendaries, such as Arceus? [ Is Mewtwo Really The Most Powerful Pokémon? ](/is-mewtwo-strongest-pokemon/) With only one trailer and an X post to pull from, there's still a lot of mystery surrounding Pokémon Legends: Z-A. If the whole game takes place in Lumiose City, what's the main goal going to be? Does it take place in the past or the future or does it switch between both? Will that one Hex Maniac ever reveal what she meant when she said the player isn't \"the one?\" (The answer to the last one is \"probably not.\") With hindsight and taking more time to come out than the Paldea games took to release after Arceus, Z-A has a lot of potential to be the best Pokémon game on the Switch. The real thing that they need to bring back, though, is Kalos' level of character customization. Time to let the player be the very best on the fashion runway again. [ Pokemon ](/tag/pokemon-anime/) Expanding across a multitude of media, including TCGs, video games, manga, live-action movies and anime, the Pokémon franchise is set in a shared world of humans and creatures with a wide variety of special abilities. - Created by - Satoshi Tajiri - First Film - Pokemon: The First Movie - Latest Film - Pokémon the Movie: Secrets of the Jungle - First TV Show - Pokemon - Latest TV Show [Pokémon Horizons](/tag/pokemon-horizons/) - First Episode Air Date - April 1, 1997 - Video Game(s) [Pokémon GO](/tag/pokemon-go/), Pokemon X and Y , [Pokémon Legends: Arceus](/tag/pokemon-legends-arceus/), [Pokémon Scarlet and Violet](/tag/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet/), [Pokémon Sword and Shield](/tag/pokemon-sword-and-shield/), Pokémon Diamond & Pearl , [Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl](/tag/pokemon-brilliant-diamond-shining-pearl/), Pokemon Red and Blue , Detective Pikachu , Detective Pikachu Returns , Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee! , Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!",
