    "text": "PUBLISHED ONApril 12, 2024 1:10 AM LOS ANGELES, USA - The VF DrgnFly boasts an impressive appearance and advanced technological features and strongly affirms VinFast's commitment to bringing exciting and intelligent mobility solutions to American consumers. The launch also marks another step in VinFast's expansion in the U.S., the world's most vibrant electric vehicle market with strong consumer awareness in sustainable mobility. The bike's design is inspired by the image of a flying dragon in the Vietnamese culture. The VF DrgnFly features a wide handlebar, balloon tires, and an ergonomically designed saddle, optimizing the riding experience in any type of journey. The VF DrgnFly also utilizes a flat frame rather than a traditional tube frame, boasting a distinctive aesthetic for the bike while still prioritizing an optimal balance between weight and durability. This design approach, which required the use of advanced fabrication techniques, demonstrates VinFast's world-class manufacturing capabilities. As a smart electric bike, the VF DrgnFly supports a mobile application that allows riders to enjoy a range of smart features, including multiple driving modes, ride statistics records, and opening/locking with special modes. Over-the-air (OTA) software updates will ensure the bike is continuously enhanced to bring a superior experience for consumers. Powered by a 750W rear hub motor, a single-speed gearbox, and a torque sensor, the VF DrgnFly offers a smooth and responsive riding experience with a top speed of up to 28 mph (45 km/h)*. The torque sensor adapts to each input, detecting changes in force of up to 16,000 times per second, far surpassing the capabilities of traditional sensors found in conventional electric bikes. The VF DrgnFly has an impressive range of up to 68 miles (110 km)* on a single charge supported by an advanced energy optimization system allowing riders to travel longer distances. The bike also comes with a home charger and a removable lithium-ion battery, providing convenience to consumers. Customers can order the VF DrgnFly through VinFast's dealer network in the U.S. Committed to delivering high-quality products and outstanding after-sales service, VinFast offers one of the best warranty policies in the market, a two-year warranty. Mr. David Duncan, Vice President of Sales and Marketing, VinFast U.S., said: \" The official launch of the VF DrgnFly in the U.S. exemplifies our unwavering commitment to bringing electric mobility to everyone. By offering a sustainable, smart, and personalized mobility option, we are embracing the green transportation revolution, paving the way for a healthier and more vibrant future.\" Building on VinFast's comprehensive range of smart electric vehicles, the VF DrgnFly will provide various sustainable mobility options and bring electric transportation closer to American consumers. In addition to growing in key markets such as the U.S., Canada, and Europe, VinFast is actively expanding into Vietnam's neighboring countries in Asia such as India, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, as well as the Middle East and Africa.
