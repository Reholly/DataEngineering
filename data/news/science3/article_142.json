    "text": "Each year the ARCS Foundation, San Diego Chapter, a nonprofit organization led entirely by women, hosts a Scientist of the Year fundraiser to honor a preeminent local scientist. This year’s honoree, Dr. Terry Sejnowski, is one of the world’s foremost computer scientists and computational neuroscientists, whose visionary and ingenious work on neural networks laid the foundation for the machine learning and AI revolution that is taking the world by storm today, according to a news release. Sejnowski is head of Salk Institute’s Computational Neurobiology Laboratory and holder of the Frances Crick Chair. He is also a distinguished professor at UC San Diego’s School of Biological Sciences, where he is co-director of the Institute for Neural Computation. ARCS San Diego invites all to join them for a celebration of science and scientists that is set for Saturday, April 27 (4-8 p.m.) at The Conrad Performing Arts Center in La Jolla. In addition to honoring Sejnowski, the program will pay tribute to this year’s ARCS Scholars – all 50 of them – along with distinguished ARCS Scholar alumnus Dr. Randall Kelley, who has served as director of data science and machine learning at several major corporations. All funds raised at this event will support future ARCS scholars. Through their research, these talented scholars make outstanding contributions to advance science and keep America competitive on the global stage, which is the ARCS mission. ARCS San Diego has put together an exciting program for its signature event. For program details and to register, go to: san-diego.arcsfoundation.org About ARCS: The ARCS Foundation (Achievement Rewards for College Scientists), a national organization with 15 chapters across the country, provides financial awards to promising graduate students who are pursuing degrees in science, technology, engineering and medical research. Since its inception in 1985, the San Diego Chapter of ARCS has given more than $12.3 million to support graduate students at four local institutions: UCSD, SDSU, USD, and Scripps Research.",
