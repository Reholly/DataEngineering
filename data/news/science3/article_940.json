    "text": "In a recent display of durability, a Tesla Cybertruck effortlessly navigated through flooded regions of the Southeast U.S. amid relentless storms that caused widespread havoc. This performance highlights Tesla's advanced engineering and marks a significant testament to the vehicle's robustness in extreme weather. Storm Havoc: Tesla Cybertruck Defies Flood Warnings as Southeast Faces Weather Onslaught Massive storms hit the Northeast last week, with several inches of rain, tornadoes, and even an earthquake reported as a storm cell moved across the country, per [Teslarati](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-cybertruck-braves-substantial-rainfall-and-standing-water-amid-massive-storms/?fbclid=IwAR2uQF5h2Lxlfm2mC_LiostIGqYFl2tk96f0QAAc2Pbmw87u-AgCi5n8e4g_aem_AWRAYb_FRK5a4xpYMvhCdF_AxivwB3KzKw5m_FHiAaakkoVgbgt3dnWedMiv9YKTMd0owvpmSItkIZ9UPy9MC-Sx). The Southeast United States is currently clutching a formidable storm cell, unleashing massive amounts of rainfall in various states. The storm cell has begun its journey out of the country and across the Atlantic Ocean, but not before leaving several inches in major metropolitan areas yesterday, April 10. New Orleans, Louisiana, was among the cities that felt the brunt of the storm. According to [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/weather/2024/04/10/storm-heavy-rain-possible-tornadoes-southeaster-united-states/73268061007/), more than 118,000 homes and businesses across Texas and Georgia were without power on Wednesday night. At least one person in Mississippi died. The storm also caused significant flooding in many areas, with some regions receiving up to eight inches of rain. New Orleans received five to eight inches of rain throughout the storm, and wind gusts up to 80 mph were also reported. While officials in New Orleans warned people about flooding and advised them to stay off the roads to avoid danger, a Tesla Cybertruck missed the memo. Tesla Cybertruck Excels in Water Trials, Highlighting Advanced Waterproof Capabilities Initially, Tesla had big plans for the Cybertruck. CEO Elon Musk stated that it could cross bodies of water such as rivers, lakes, and seas because the company wanted to equip the pickup with waterproof capabilities in certain conditions. This unique feature sets the Cybertruck apart from other vehicles, as it can continue operating even when other cars would be rendered immobile. Musk wanted the vehicle to travel from Starbase to South Padre Island in Texas, a 6.5-mile distance. As a testament to Tesla's innovative approach, the Cybertruck was equipped with Wade Mode, a feature designed to protect the battery pack by pressurizing it. This unique feature, particularly useful in heavy rain and storm conditions, also increases the vehicle's ride height, allowing it to traverse flooded areas without issue. According to a source, the Cybertruck made its way through some bodies of water while driving along the ocean's shoreline and also completed a somewhat tricky task in a [deep-water](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-cybertruck-deep-water-test-video/) test. This test involved submerging the vehicle in a controlled environment to assess its ability to withstand extreme water conditions, and the Cybertruck passed with flying colors.",
