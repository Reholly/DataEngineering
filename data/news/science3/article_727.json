The standout features include enhanced 5G connectivity for smooth team collaboration, IP68-rated durability for water and dust resistance, and device displays adjustable for touch sensitivity, tailored for workers who may need to operate the devices while wearing gloves.\nIn a first for Samsung's ruggedised devices, both the Galaxy XCover7 and the Galaxy Tab Active5 come armed with support for Samsung Knox Vault, offering a level of security that can safeguard data, including lock screen information such as PIN codes, passwords and patterns.\nBuilding on the rising trend of rugged device adoption across Asia Pacific, which increased from 48% to 81% between 2020 and 2022, Samsung aims to equip businesses facing unprecedented challenges and dynamic needs. As Jerry Park, EVP and Head of Global Mobile B2B Team, MX Business at Samsung Electronics, stated, \"Samsung understands that businesses today face unprecedented challenges and opportunities, and they need devices that can keep up with their dynamic needs.\"\nTested against the MIL-STD-810H7 military standard for durability, the new devices are capable of resisting water and dust, with the Galaxy Samsung XCover7 able to withstand accidental drops of up to 1.5m on steel surfaces.
