    "text": "You would think the year’s biggest moment in astrology would be an eclipse or a series of ruthless retrogrades . But in 2024, the biggest astrological happening is the simple conjunction of two planets: Jupiter and Uranus.\nIn astrology, a conjunction is when two planets align in the same part of the sky, under the same zodiac sign . It’s a frequent occurrence among other astral combos, but these two planets have the ability to see big disruptions, changes or manoeuvres on a macro and micro scale.\nThe conjunction of Uranus and Jupiter is set to occur on April 21, 2024 (or April 20, if you’re in the northern hemisphere), following an already significant month of eclipse seasons and mercury retrograde .\nUranus is the planet of rebellion and revolution, while Jupiter is about belief and big picture. Together, they could be pretty wild. According to astrologer Emma Vidgen, known online as @emma_vee , the Jupiter Uranus conjunction is “probably the big moment of the year that everyone’s going to be talking about from an astrology perspective.”\nSo, let’s dive in, shall we?\nWhat Is A Conjunction In Astrology? First thing’s first: what is a conjunction?\nWhen two planets are “conjunct” it means they are in (or around) the same place, in the same sign. If you think of the sky like a large circle divided into 12 sections or ‘houses’, with each house ruled by a different star sign. Then imagine Jupiter and Uranus are lining up at the same degree in the Taurus sector as they both track their usual orbit.\nIn astrology, each planet represents its own themes and features, and the relative closeness of these planets when conjunct, sort of represents a collision or melding of these themes.\nConjunctions happen all the time between many combinations of planets. However, some specific combinations may be more rare than others. The last conjunction between Jupiter and Uranus, for instance, was in 2011, and the next one will be in 2037.\nWhat could Jupiter conjunct Uranus mean for you? Image: Getty What Does The Jupiter Uranus Conjunction Mean? As with all planetary happenings, they mean different things to different people. The Jupiter Uranus conjunction will, according to Emma, be a big moment for society at large.\nAs Jupiter moves its period of time in the sign of Taurus, it will meet Uranus towards its finale in the sign.\nUranus is the planet of rebellion, uprisings, defiance and revolution. Jupiter, being the planet of belief and big picture, this collision is going to be huge, Emma says.\n“Jupiter/Uranus conjunctions are historically a time of big revolutions,” Emma explains. “So, there’s the possibility of this rising-up of people based on belief. It will be a very significant moment from a more macro perspective.”\nIn astrology, a map of the sky might look something like this. The houses are numbered 1-12, and the sign of each house will be different depending on your birth chart. Image: Getty What does the Jupiter Uranus conjunction mean for you? While you will certainly witness or feel the effects of these macro-level changes, on a personal level this planetary conjunction is an invitation to shake off any self-imposed restrictions.\nIf you know where Taurus is in your chart, consider how the planet of defiance might lead to bigger things for you in that area. For instance, if you have Taurus in your 5th house of romance, play and creativity, the Jupiter Uranus conjunction might be a good time to take a chance on a new idea or lover.\n“Look for those spontaneous opportunities to say yes to things you might not otherwise,” Emma encourages. “Accept the invitation you normally wouldn’t, go on the date with that person who is a bit outside your remit of what you would normally consider.”\n“It’s really about breaking free of these constraints that we tie ourselves up in. It’s really exciting.”\nRead about all the major moments in 2024 astrology, here.",
