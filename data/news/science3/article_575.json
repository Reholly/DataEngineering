    "text": "Adam, it is nice to see you. Thanks for welcoming us here for launch day. You’re launching your new venture today, Flo, I know that you’ve been heads down over the last few years just concentrating on developing it. I want to get into it. I want to get into Wework, which I know you’re trying to buy back. But first I thought we might just address the elephant in the room. Some people might be surprised to see you on our screens again. What are you going to do differently this time around? Well, first of all, thank you so much for coming down here to Flo, Fort Lauderdale. It is an extremely exciting day for us. But let’s start with that. We built a global brand. We had over 10,000 employees that were so passionate. We helped redefine a category and every single thing we did had to do almost anything and everything with community. I am the kind of person that actually learns more from their mistakes than from their successes. So all the great things we did in the past, we’re going to do again. But then I had time to reflect. For example, partners. I’m so grateful and lucky to have Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz from A16Z as my partners. For those of you who don’t know, they both come to my board meetings and our boardroom is exciting. And for those of you who don’t know them, they speak their mind if you want them to or if you don’t. So there’s more debate in the boardroom than there was before. Debate is an understatement. There are lively discussions that can go all over the place. They’re also a great partnership themselves. So it could be them and me, and they hold you more accountable. Everyone’s holding everyone more accountable and I have the pleasure to working with them and they are entrepreneurs. This is actually their third business. So it’s one thing to have investors who are giving advice. It’s another thing to have entrepreneurs who you consider peers that are working with you. That’s one example. The other one is something you just said. I’ve taken my time. We did not rush, we did not rush to launch this brand. We’ve been running this business for the past two years. We built our operating systems, we built our technology back end and front end. We rebuilt processes. We rebuilt the property management company and we did all of that to practice and test and see what works and what doesn’t. And even before we launched the brand, this building that you’re in now is 95% full, other Florida location is 96% full and that was before the brand, right. So I want to get into flow and this business model, your mission, I’m going to read from your website revolutionize the residential experience as a virtually integrated, vertically integrated real estate owner operator and technology innovator. What does that mean? So I’m not sure where you read that in the website, but it’s it’s actually more about coming to your higher self between you and yourself, your neighbour and the world. So our mission is actually bringing everybody together. What you read I think is from the bio which is a little bit of what we’re doing. Bio will explain is that accurate though, are you a real estate owner, operator and technology innovator, extremely accurate. So flow is an experience first residential real estate company. We’re vertically integrated. So we have technology, we have operations and we have the people that bring it all together. Also, as you can see around you, design is a very important aspect of what we do. And by bringing all of these things together, we had a theory two years ago that the buildings will become more valuable in both of our Florida properties. We’re already starting to show that with much higher performance are the buildings more valuable than when you bought them, so more valuable. Now we’re asking a real estate question of cap rates, but if you’re asking if the buildings have higher NOI net operating income than when we bought them, this building you’re sitting in has a 40% higher NOI than when we took over 18 months. And does that mean that you’ve increased rents, rent growth, which is also metric important and that’s a great question. We also increased rent gross, but some of the viewers might say, oh, Miami’s rent growth are up. So actually Fort Lauderdale where we’re at, rent has gone down 8% in the past 12 months. So we’ve increased our rent, but also we lower churn. When people like being in a building, when they actually feel like they’re part of a community, they stay. When people stay and there’s no churn in the building, it increases occupancy and increases the value. But that’s just one. So just to be clear, you are increasing value and that’s reflected in the value of the real estate that you own. So I’m going to answer it very precisely. Another lesson, I’m going to answer it very precisely. We’ve increased the net operating income of the building you’re sitting in by over 40% since we took over 18 months ago. If you want to say what it’s worth, that’s a question for people who buy. It’s a different metric, but NOI is how we’re measuring it and the and the value of the building. You only know, by the way, what the building is worth is when you sell it.News Related - AWS and Clarity AI to use generative AI to boost sustainable investments Cloud computing experts, builders, customers, partners, and technology enthusiasts descend on Las Vegas to attend AWS re:Invent event that runs through December 1.
