    "text": "Sui (SUI) experienced a significant 45% correction against Bitcoin after a tremendous rally in Q1 this year, according to analyst Micha√´l van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL). However, the analyst suggests this could present an opportunity to buy the dip. What you'll learn üëâ Trend Line Breakdown and Retest Van de Poppe‚Äôs chart [reveals](https://x.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1778426527102673204) a downward trendline connecting the highs from June to August. The price has broken down from this trendline. ‚ÄúSUI has seen a tremendous upwards rally in Q1, but since February it has been seeing a 45% correction on the Bitcoin valuation,‚Äù he stated. The analyst has marked an ellipse at the bottom right, noting ‚ÄúPotential retest is an entry on the BTC pair.‚Äù This implies a retest of this level could offer an attractive entry point for trading the SUI/BTC pair. Invalidation and Take Profit Areas Additionally, Van de Poppe has highlighted key support and resistance zones. A green ‚ÄúInvalidation area‚Äù represents a level where a potential long trade would be invalidated if SUI‚Äôs price drops below it. Conversely, a red ‚ÄúPotential take profit level‚Äù indicates a resistance zone where traders might consider taking profits if the price reaches it after a successful breakout. The analyst‚Äôs annotations also include three circles with upward arrows, suggesting areas where SUI‚Äôs price broke above prior highs ‚Äì potential liquidity pool areas. The key?
