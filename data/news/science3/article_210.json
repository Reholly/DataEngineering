    "text": "Amazon Prime Members Can Play Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas for Free, but There’s a Catch An Exclusive Offer for Amazon Prime Members Are you a fan of the Fallout series? As an Amazon Prime member, you can now enjoy two of the most beloved open-world RPGs for free. However, there’s a catch:\nImage: Bethesda\nImage: Bethesda\nAmazon’s Cloud Streaming Service, Luna If you want to play Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas through Amazon Prime, you’ll need to use Amazon’s cloud streaming service, Luna. While this exclusive offer opens up new gaming opportunities, it has its limitations:\nThe Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: October 2023 Edition Issues with Luna’s Gameplay Experience If you’re hoping for a flawless gameplay experience, Luna might not be the best option for you. Some users have reported lag and hitching issues along with less than optimal image quality.\nCompared to playing Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas through other platforms like Steam, Luna falls short on a few key aspects:\nLag and hitching issues Lower image quality No availability of mods If you’re a passionate Fallout fan, this might be a dealbreaker.\nFallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas Leaving Luna and Prime Furthermore, please note that Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas will only be available on Luna and Prime until October 10. So if you’re considering trying out these games through Amazon’s streaming service, be sure to act fast!\nPrime Members’ Additional Gaming Perks It’s not all bad news for Prime members. Alongside this exclusive offer, Amazon is also giving away Fallout 76 for free on Xbox and PC through Prime Gaming. The best part? You won’t be limited to streaming it via Luna.\nConclusion While the prospect of playing Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas for free through Amazon Prime might sound exciting, the experience may not be as seamless as other gaming platforms. With Luna’s limitations and the impending departure of the games, it’s worth considering alternative avenues to fully enjoy these immersive RPGs.",
