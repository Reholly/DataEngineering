    "text": "Singapore’s gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 2.7% in the 1Q2024, according to the Ministry of Trade and Industry’s (MTI) advance estimates released on April 12.\nThe figure stood slightly ahead of market watchers’ expectations of a 2.6% y-o-y growth in the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s (MAS) March 2024 survey of professional forecasters .\nOn a q-o-q seasonally adjusted basis, the economy expanded by 0.1%.\nThe manufacturing sector grew by 0.8% y-o-y in the 1Q2024, moderating from the 1.4% y-o-y expansion in the previous quarter.\nThe construction sector expanded by 4.3% y-o-y, extending the 5.2% y-o-y growth in the 4Q2023.\nThe wholesale & retail trade and transportation and storage sectors collectively expanded by 2.7% y-o-y, accelerating from the 1.0% growth in the quarter before.\nLearn More\nSee also: Singapore set to keep monetary policy tight, may ease in October\nThe group of sectors comprising the information & communications, finance & insurance and professional services sectors grew by 4.2% y-o-y in the 1Q2024, outpacing the 3.6% y-o-y growth seen in the 4Q2023.\nGrowth of the remaining group of services sectors (i.e., accommodation & food services, real estate, administrative & support services and other services sectors) grew by 2.9% y-o-y in the 1Q2024, higher than the 2.0% growth in the preceding quarter.\nAt the same time, MAS announced that it will maintain the prevailing rate of appreciation of the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER) policy band. There will be no change to its width and the level at which it is centred, says the central bank in its April 12 announcement.\nSee also: Singapore economy ‘drifting sideways’, says PhillipCapital\nIt adds that the current monetary policy settings remain “appropriate” with the Singapore economy expected to strengthen over 2024. Growth is expected to become more broad based.\n“The slightly negative output gap is projected to narrow further in 2H2024, even as underlying inflationary pressures gradually dissipate,” says MAS.\nThe country’s core inflation is expected to remain elevated in the “earlier part of the year” but should remain on its “broadly moderating path” and lower in the 4Q2024 before falling even further in 2025.\n“The prevailing rate of appreciation of the policy band is needed to keep a restraining effect on imported inflation as well as domestic cost pressures, and is sufficient to ensure medium-term price stability,” continues MAS.",
