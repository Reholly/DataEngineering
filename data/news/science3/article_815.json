    "text": "Mitsubishi Triton scores 5 star ANCAP result New-gen Triton is the first dual-cab to get full marks under tougher testing rules 12 Apr 2024, 10:39 am Share Facebook Twitter Email Copy Link Alex Inwood Gallery 4 Snapshot Sixth-generation Triton awarded maximum 5 star safety Becomes the first dual-cab to achieve full marks under tougher rules Scored well for adult and child occupant protection Active safety score just made the threshold for five stars; is below rivals like Ford Ranger The 2024 Mitsubishi Triton has become the first dual cab ute to achieve a five star ANCAP safety score under fresh, more stringent testing criteria. The sixth-generation Triton, which we rated as 8/10 in our launch review last month, scored highly in ANCAP’s physical crash tests and recorded strong results for both front passages and child dummies in the second row.\nReview\n2024 Mitsubishi Triton review: Australian launch Biggest makeover in dual-cab history? Slick new Triton shows plenty of promise\n8 / 10 Score\nANCAP gave the Triton an adult occupant protection rating of 86 per cent and noted that maximum scores were given for the passenger in the front offset test and the driver in the full width frontal and oblique side pole tests.\nChild occupant protection was rated even higher at 89 per cent and full marks were given for both child dummies in the frontal and side impact tests.\n4 ANCAP did deliver a weak chest score for rear passengers however, and noted there was room for improvement in how the Triton protects the chest and upper legs of children sitting in the back.\nLike most dual cabs, child seats can also only be anchored to the Triton’s outboard positions as the centre seat doesn’t have a top tether point.\n4 ANCAP’s testing report applauded Mitsubishi’s “considered approach” to the new model’s exterior design which helped it perform well in pedestrian impact tests. The Triton scored 74 per cent for vulnerable road user protection and its grille and front bumper performed well “in assessment of risk to a pedestrian’s leg or pelvis”.\nThe Mitsubishi Triton has eight airbags including: dual front, side chest, side head, centre and one for the driver’s knee. 4 In terms of active safety, the Triton scored 70 percent for Safety Assist (12.75 points out of a possible 18) which is the threshold for a five star score. By comparison a Ford Ranger carries a score of 83 per cent in this criteria, however that was achieved under the old testing rules in 2022.\nANCAP noted that while the Triton’s Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) system can detect and respond to other vehicles, pedestrians, cyclist and motorcyclists, it doesn’t have the capability of more advanced AEB systems to avoid a crash at a T-bone intersection or a head-on collision. “This limited its overall Safety Assist score,” said ANCAP.\nThe Triton’s five star result applies to all 2WD and AWD double-cab versions on sale in Australia and New Zealand.",
