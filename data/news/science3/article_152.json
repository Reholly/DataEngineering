    "text": "In 2014, the American Diabetes Association instituted a novel funding paradigm to support diabetes research through its Pathway to Stop Diabetes® Program. Pathway took a multifaceted approach to provide key funding to diabetes researchers in advancing a broad spectrum of research programs centered on all aspects of understanding, managing, and treating diabetes. Herein the personal perspective of a 2019 Pathway Accelerator awardee is offered, describing a research program seeking to advance a materials-centered approach to engineering glucose-responsive devices and new delivery tools for better therapeutic outcomes in treating diabetes. This is offered alongside a personal reflection on five years of support from the ADA Pathway Program.
