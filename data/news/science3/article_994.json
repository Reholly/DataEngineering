    "text": "Bandai Namco has revealed that PAC-MAN Mega Tunnel Battle, its previously-Stadia-exclusive 64-player “battle royale” take on the arcade classic, is getting its\nwider release on May 9th with the unnecessarily long title, PAC-MAN Mega Tunnel Battle: Chomp Champs.\nChomp Champs is headed to PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Switch and PC and will feature enhanced visuals over the Stadia version, along with new game modes, customisation options and new music. It’s also support cross-platform play and custom matchmaking along with a Ranked mode and global leaderboards.\nIn the game, players eat through a series of interconnected mazes in a bid to become the last PAC standing and crowned the “Chomp Champ.” Not only will players be able to directly chomp down on one another, but they can use power-ups, the environment and tactical guile to turn the iconic Ghosts onto their opponents.\nPre-orders are open now, and it’ll come in both Standard ($29.95) and Deluxe ($44.95) editions, with all pre-orders getting the Chomp Challengers DLC bonus. The Deluxe Edition comes with two more DLC packs and seven days early access.\nYou can check out a\npre-order trailer for PAC-MAN Mega Tunnel Battle: Chomp Champs below:",
