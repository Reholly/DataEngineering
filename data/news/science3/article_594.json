    "text": "Technical analysts are turning bullish on two major cryptocurrencies ‚Äì VeChain (VET) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) ‚Äì as both tokens show signs of potential breakouts after years of consolidation. What you'll learn üëâ VeChain Eyes 400% Rally After Clearing Key Hurdles [According](https://x.com/WorldOfCharts1/status/1778293789427417188) to @WorldOfCharts1, VET has broken through multiple critical resistance levels, setting the stage for a massive rally in the coming weeks. ‚ÄúVET recently breaks multiple resistances, multi-year descending trendline + horizontal resistance accumulation area and retested perfectly,‚Äù the analyst stated. Moreover, VET has now breached a bullish flag pattern, which is frequently seen as a continuation signal after an initial uptrend. Besides, if the breakout is confirmed, @WorldOfCharts1 has an ambitious upside target of 484.08% gain for VET from current levels. The chart reveals VET has respected long-term support levels over the years, suggesting a zone where buyers have consistently entered positions. Additionally, the bullish pennant pattern formed by VET‚Äôs price action adds conviction to the potential breakout thesis. The key? Getting in early, especially during the ICO phase.

Bitcoin Cash Uptrend Could Resume After Pullback Meanwhile, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) investors have witnessed a commendable bullish performance following a classic ‚ÄòBullish Pennant‚Äô breakout. The asset confidently surpassed the $500 mark, soaring towards a $700 valuation, which aligned with the anticipated target for a 40% profit margin. However, the ascent encountered resistance at the $700 threshold, marking it as a repeated point where prices faced rejection. Source: [altFINS ‚Äì Start using it today](https://captainaltcoin.com/go/altfins/) BCH is now eyeing the $600 support level as a potential springboard. This zone presents a tactical entry point for traders, with a rebound offering a 15% upside, potentially retesting the $700 resistance. Seasoned market participants would consider setting a Stop Loss at $560 to mitigate risk, positioning it just beneath the previous swing low. The landscape across timeframes is favorable, with a resilient uptrend noted short, medium, and long-term. In terms of momentum, signals are giving mixed readings. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence paints a bearish picture with its line beneath the signal line. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) counters with a bullish sentiment, resting above 55. As traders monitor these indicators, the support following the $600 foothold is notably at $500, providing a cushion. On the ascent, after the $700 challenge, traders set their eyes on the $800 peak as the next frontier. While no technical signal is infallible, the formations spotted by @WorldOfCharts1 and @AltFINS suggest crypto traders should keep VET and BCH on their radar for potential long opportunities in the coming sessions.
