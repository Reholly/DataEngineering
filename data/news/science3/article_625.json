Apple, which has not announced the plans, wants every Mac model to have the chip update, the publication added.\nApple is considering a launch of the updated computers by the end of 2024 and into the beginning of 2025. The new in-house processing chip also comes at a time when Mac’s sales have declined. During the 2023 fiscal year,\nMac sales decreased by 27%.
