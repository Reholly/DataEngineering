    "text": "Oh, and mathematics memes, but it was subtracted from the title… Do you like these memes? Do you enjoy a gathering of memes? You see, that's what I do. I do not do complicated science, technology, engineering, and math… Especially not math (*shudders in calculus*). So I'm not going to type away like I know anything in STEM. I am not a woman in STEM. Unless STEM stands for “sleeping, tequila, eating, and memes,\" then you're not going to catch me doing a math problem with a letter in it. So, yes, my embarrassing confession is that I don't quite understand many of the memes below. But I am a girls girl. I support women in STEM, I support women any chance I can get! So let me first applaud you for not letting the patriarchy dumb you down. And second, present you with some memes I hope you find funny as a show of my appreciation! And third, could you explain them to me? Why does math have to have numbers?? Don't answer that… Just enjoy these memes! [If you're more of a moon girly, then let me offer up these memes for you to enjoy!](https://cheezburger.com/25387013/a-total-eclipse-of-the-memes-for-moon-girlies)",
