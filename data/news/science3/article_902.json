    "text": "Hansa Biopharma Announces Successful Execution of a Directed Share Issue of SEK 372 million (~USD 34.6 million) NOT FOR PUBLICATION, DISTRIBUTION OR RELEASE, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, IN OR INTO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, THE UNITED KINGDOM, AUSTRALIA, CANADA, HONG KONG, ISRAEL, JAPAN, NEW ZEALAND, SOUTH AFRICA, SWITZERLAND OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION WHERE SUCH PUBLICATION, DISTRIBUTION OR RELEASE WOULD BE UNLAWFUL OR REQUIRE REGISTRATION OR OTHER MEASURES. Lund, Sweden April 12, 2024. Hansa Biopharma AB (publ), (\"Hansa\" or the \"Company\") (Nasdaq Stockholm: HNSA) today announced that the board of directors has authorized the issue of 12,780,000 total new ordinary shares (the \"New Shares\") in a directed share issue based on the shareholder consent granted at the annual general meeting on June 29, 2023 (\"Directed Share Issue\"). The Directed Share Issue is divided into two tranches where the first tranche consists of 10,474,740 New Shares (the \"First Tranche\") and the second tranche consists of 2,305,260 New Shares (the \"Second Tranche\"), for a total of 12,780,000 New Shares. Settlement in the Second Tranche requires approval and publication of a customary listing prospectus, which is expected to occur on or around April 30, 2024. Trading in the shares issued in the Second Tranche is expected to commence on Nasdaq Stockholm shortly thereafter. The price for the New Shares is SEK 29.12 per New Share, corresponding to the closing price of Hansa shares as traded on Nasdaq Stockholm on April 11, 2024. The price per New Share in the Directed Share Issue has been determined by the board of directors, based on arm's length negotiations with the participating investors, including both participating current shareholders and new investors, as well as in consultation with William Blair & Company, L.L.C. (\"William Blair\") and Carnegie Investment Bank AB (publ) (\"Carnegie\") (together referred to as the \"Joint Bookrunners\"). The board of directors of Hansa considers the price for the New Shares to be at market. The investors in the Directed Share Issue were Braidwell LP, Redmile Group, the Fourth Swedish National Pension Fund, Sphera Healthcare, Woodline Partners LP, an entity managed by Heights Capital Ireland LLC and Maven Investment Partners. The board of directors of Hansa believes that there is a value to current shareholders participating in the Directed Share Issue. Through the Directed Share Issue, Hansa will receive proceeds amounting to approximately SEK 372.2 million (approximately USD 34.6 million) before transaction costs. Through the Directed Share Issue, the number of outstanding shares and votes in the Company will increase from 55,034,241 shares to 67,814,241 shares and from 52,908,040.50 votes to 65,688,040.5 votes. Following the registration of the New Shares, the share capital will increase from SEK 55,034,241 to SEK 67,814,241. Søren Tulstrup, President and CEO, Hansa Biopharma said: \"I am very pleased to see the strong interest in the Hansa equity story from leading international healthcare specialist investors. This transaction will help finance the preparation of a potential U.S. launch of imlifidase in kidney transplantation, strengthen ongoing product development in autoimmune indications and allow for continued clinical development of HNSA-5487, the lead candidate from the NiceR program for repeat dosing.\" The board of directors has made an overall assessment and carefully considered the possibility to raise capital through a rights issue. The board of directors has concluded that a rights issue would entail significantly longer execution time and thereby increased market exposure and a higher potential risk of materially affecting the share price negatively, particularly in this volatile and challenging market, compared to a directed issue. A share issue with preferential rights for the current shareholders would also entail a risk of not being fully subscribed or becoming expensive due to the need for guarantees. Further, there is a strong interest in bringing on board strategic biotech investors to strengthen the shareholder base, in particular healthcare specialist investors U.S. based investors which also could play an important role in a contemplated future listing in the U.S. Considering the above, the board of directors has made the assessment that the Directed Share Issue with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is the most favorable alternative for Hansa, creates value for the Company and is in the best interest of the Company's shareholders. Use of proceeds and lock-up undertakings Hansa intends to use the net proceeds from the Directed Share Issue to fund continued development and preparation for a potential U.S. launch of imlifidase, continued development of HNSA-5487, working capital and other general corporate purposes. In connection with the Directed Share Issue, the Company has agreed to a lock-up undertaking, with customary exceptions, on future share issuances for a period of 90 calendar days after the settlement date of the First Tranche. In addition, the members of the board of directors and executive management have undertaken not to, subject to customary exceptions, divest any shares in the Company for a period of 90 days from the settlement date of the First Tranche. Advisers William Blair and Carnegie acted as Joint Bookrunners in connection to the Directed Share Issue. Advokatfirman Vinge KB acted as legal adviser to the Company and White & Case acted as legal adviser to the Joint Bookrunners in connection with the Directed Share Issue.
