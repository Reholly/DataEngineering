    "text": "Eclipse viewers can now donate their glasses to others around the world On Thursday, Moshe Gai, an astronomy professor at UConns’ Avery Point campus, still raved about the spectacular views he saw of the total solar eclipse in northern Vermont. “It was the best I have ever seen, out of four so far,” Gai said about Monday’s eclipse. Gai, also a member of the Thames Amateur Astronomical Society, was part of a second historic event on Monday as well, as eclipse watchers created one of the worst traffic jams in Vermont history. Gai left his Branford home at 7 a.m. for the normally 4 ½-hour drive to the farm in Newford, Vt. owned by former physics student Tristan Kading. He arrived shortly after 3 p.m., just 15 minutes before the eclipse totality and 8 hours after he left home. The drive back to his hotel in White River Junction was even worse, as Vermont officials estimated more than 160,000 visitors trekked to what was forecast to be some of the best weather for the total eclipse. “It was worth every minute of this ride,” Gai said. Now, days later, Gai and many others still have those cardboard framed, dark film lens viewing glasses they used on Monday on their kitchen counters, tables and bureaus. Gai warned against stowing the glasses in a drawer to await the next solar eclipse years from now. The film in the eclipse viewing glasses deteriorates over time, developing tiny pinholes not visible to the naked eye. But those tiny holes could damage the eyes if users looked at the sun. Nationwide eclipse glasses collection drives underway Two organizations, [Astronomers Without Borders](https://astronomerswithoutborders.org/programs/solar-glasses-distribution) and [Eclipse Glasses USA](https://eclipse23.com/pages/donate-eclipse-glasses), have launched eclipse glasses collection drives nationwide. The groups will inspect the glasses to make sure they are in good condition and send them to schools and groups at sites around the world where solar eclipses can be viewed in the coming months. Locally, Otis Library, 261 Main St., Norwich, and the Norwich recreation center, 75 Mohegan Road, Norwich, will collect eclipse glasses for donation. Glasses in good condition can be dropped off at the front desk during library and recreation department hours. Idis Andino, administration specialist for Norwich Human Services Youth, Family and Recreation division, said she and library Executive Director Cathleen Special worked to set up the collection. Andino said the glasses will be collected through April 19 at both the library and the recreation center and will be mailed to Eclipse Glasses USA on April 22, Earth Day. “We thought that would be an appropriate day to send them,” Andino said. Astronomers Without Borders does not have a direct collection center in eastern Connecticut, but the California-based organization has partnered with eyeglasses company Warby Parker to collect eclipse glasses. The company has store locations in Darien, Greenwich, Norwalk, Farmington and New Haven. “Astronomers Without Borders has been sending solar glasses for annular and total solar eclipse since 2008,” the group posted on its website, astronomerswithoutborders.org. “From Africa, Asia, North and South America, our members, partners and National Coordinators helped to bring glasses to people who may not otherwise have a safe way to view the eclipse directly.” Eclipse Glasses USA plans to send glasses it collects to Central America for an eclipse viewing this August. The organization will accept glasses mailed to its Utah office until Aug. 1. Package glasses in a padded envelope and send to Eclipse Glasses USA, P.O. Box 50571, Provo, UT 84605. If the recent solar eclipse experience sparked an interest for viewers in the day or night sky, the Thames Amateur Astronomical Society welcomes new enthusiasts. Club member R. M. “Max” Maxwell of Groton said the group has about a dozen active and interactive members and more than 60 people on its email group list. The club partners with UConn Avery Point in September for night sky viewing sessions every Wednesday that has good weather and either no moon or up to a quarter moon. Gai said the events are very popular, sometimes with 100 attendees. Announcements of the events will be placed in The Day in advance, Gai said. The club also collaborates with Mystic Seaport Museum for programs at the museum’s planetarium, where Maxwell is a part-time staffer.
