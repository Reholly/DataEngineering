    "text": "Three Baltimoreans — an author, an astrophysicist and a philosopher — [joined 185 other “midcareer culture creators”](https://www.gf.org/announcements/) Thursday in earning prestigious fellowships from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation in New York. They are: [Sonia Shah](https://soniashah.com/), whose book topics span science, politics and human-animal relations; [Marc Kamionkowski](https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/kamionkowski/), a professor at Johns Hopkins University who specializes in cosmology and particle physics; and [Jenann Ismael](https://www.jenanni.com/), the William H. Miller III Professor of Philosophy at Johns Hopkins University, where she explores questions about the structure of space and time and quantum mechanics. The Guggenheim Fellowship winners were winnowed from a pool of more than 3,000 applicants in 52 disciplines, according to a news release from the fellowship. Each Fellow will receive a grant to help support an independent project “at the highest level under the freest possible conditions.” Among the notable projects from prior years is Zora Neale Hurston’s 1936 book “Their Eyes Were Watching God.” Foundation president and poet Edward Hirsch said in the news release that the fellows are “generating new possibilities and pathways across the broader culture” in their work. The foundation has awarded over $400 million in fellowships to more than 19,000 mid-career innovators since its founding in 1925.",
