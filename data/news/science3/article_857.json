    "text": "PancakeSwap enables limit orders through Orbs partnership\nOrbs' dLIMIT and dTWAP protocols set a new standard in DeFi trading on PancakeSwap.\nShare this article\nDecentralized exchange (DEX) PancakeSwap has announced the integration of limit orders by applying Orbs’ dLimit and dTWAP protocols into its platform. Users can also utilize the divisible order function, which allows them to divide large orders into smaller trades to mitigate price impact.\n“PancakeSwap’s integration of dLIMIT and dTWAP brings powerful new trading features to millions of DeFi users. In the process, it reinforces the protocol’s status as the preeminent solution for supporting advanced order types,” commented Ran Hammer, Orbs VP of Business Development. “Thanks to dLIMIT and dTWAP, PancakeSwap users will be able to trade more efficiently and enjoy better order execution without compromising on decentralization.”\nThe Orbs network provides an infrastructure through its layer-3 technology, with solutions designed to be fully decentralized, permissionless, and composable, aligning with the ethos of decentralized finance (DeFi). The addition of these features on PancakeSwap is expected to enhance the trading experience by providing more flexibility and efficiency in order execution. At the time of writing, the DEX was handled almost $8 billion in weekly trading volume, according to on-chain data aggregator DefiLlama.\nMoreover, PancakeSwap’s integration follows the successful adoption of dLimit and dTWAP by other prominent DEXs, including QuickSwap, SpookySwap, and Thena. With this expansion, PancakeSwap aims to offer its users a broader range of trading options across multiple Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) based chains such as BNB Chain, Ethereum, zkSync, and Arbitrum.\nShare this article",
