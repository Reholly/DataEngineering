    "text": "Adobe Will Pay You to Train AI WIth Your Videos\nIf you need a way to make some quick cash, this is an option from Adobe's AI team.\nWant to make money with some of the videos you have lying around on hard drives? Well, Adobe has a solution that might make you some scratch to put into your camera fund or, if nothing else, buy yourself a nice dinner.\nAdobe is investing heavily in\nFirefly, its generative AI platform, after all the viral buzz of the controversial Sora videos.\nBut, as you can imagine, training generative AI in Firefly is actually pretty hard, especially with all the probable copyright claims that may come where generative AI programs get sued for using other people's work to train programs.\nAdobe needs a way around that, so they're turning to you.\nBloomberg reports that Adobe is “offering its network of photographers and artists 120 dollars to submit videos of people engaged in everyday actions such as walking or expressing emotions including joy and anger, according to documents seen by Bloomberg. The goal is to source assets for artificial intelligence training, the company wrote.”\nAdobe seeks over 100 short video clips showcasing everyday actions, emotions, basic anatomy (feet, hands, eyes), and people using objects like smartphones and fitness gear. Please avoid copyrighted material, nudity, or offensive content.\nSo, how much can you make?\nThe article says you can make $2.60 per minute for the submitted video, although it can range up to as much as $7.25 a minute.\nNow, this may feel like you're training your own replacement... and it's hard to argue with that notion. Hopefully, AI will become a tool that skilled filmmakers are allowed to wield, and not one that takes their jobs.\nLet me know what you think in the comments.\nHow Adobe's AI Brings Crystal-Clear Audio to Your Projects › Why Are Adobe Staff Worried About AI? › How Is Adobe Photoshop’s AI Generative Fill Like a Matte Painting? ›",
