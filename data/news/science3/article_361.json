    "text": "All Saints Catholic School Robotics Team ready for world competition BANGOR, Maine (WABI) - The Robotics Team at Bangor’s All Saints Catholic School did quite well in the state competition. “We challenge ourselves more so that we were more powerful, which is how we won the Excellence Award, which is the best overall at the competition and individually. So, we had the best build, the best document, and the best program out of every single team.” explained Lizzi Bergin, member of the robotics team. “We placed first in Division One. We won the highest place award there. It’s like it all was steady, I mean we just shot up in skill and devotion to it. It takes a lot of willpower to push through because it gets stressful.” said McKinley Robinson-Rice, member of the robotics team. After doing well in the state competition, they have the opportunity to compete with 498 schools from 50 countries in the Vex Robotics World Competition in Dallas, Texas. “We’re traveling halfway across the country just to go do what we thought was just a little club every Fridays. Like, I got into it, just thinking it was just something extra to do, and I never really expected to go this far with it.” added Robinson-Rice. Copyright 2024 WABI. All rights reserved.",
