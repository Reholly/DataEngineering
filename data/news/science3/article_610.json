    "text": "Leica has introduced a new generation of its camera phone: the Leitz Phone 3 made its debut in Japan. Unlike most flagship models of 2024, the newcomer is not built on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 but on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2. However, the main focus here is not on performance. The Leica Leitz Phone 3 features a one-inch sensor with a resolution of 47.2 MP. It comes with a lens module featuring an F/1.9 aperture and a focal length of 19 mm. The camera software allows for simulating the shooting with various classic lenses. For instance, Noctilux-M 50mm f/1.2, Sumilux-M 28mm f/1.4, and Sumilux-M 35mm f /1.4. The company claims that shooting in Leica Style mode has significantly improved in terms of color rendition, object segmentation, etc. Additionally, the Leica Leitz Phone 3 has support for the proprietary Leica Perspective Control technology, which, based on predefined algorithms and gyroscope data, eliminates distortion. The smartphone's front camera features a 12.6 MP sensor and a lens with an F/2.3 aperture and a 78Â° field of view. The smartphone boasts an OLED screen with a 6.6-inch diagonal, a resolution of 2730 x 1260 pixels, and a refresh rate of 240 Hz. The battery capacity is 5000 mAh (supports wireless charging), and the flash memory size is 512 GB. Alongside the USB-C port, there is also a standard headphone jack. The sales of the new model will start in Japan on April 19, with the price yet to be announced. month week day",
