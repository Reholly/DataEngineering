CEO Tarang Amin joined CNBC's \"Mad Money\" with Jim Cramer Tuesday to discuss the company's digital strategy. What Happened: Amin told Cramer that E.l.f Beauty’s digital business was up over 100% last quarter, which he attributed to the company’s willingness to try new things. \"As a digitally native brand, we're constantly testing and learning,\" Amin said on the show. \"We're going to constantly test and learn on new frontiers and delight our community.\" E.l.f. was one of the first beauty brands to embrace TikTok. The company also has its own channel on Twitch and offers a popular brand experience on Roblox with over 9 million plays. The company's newest digital experience is the \"your best e.l.f.\" app for the Apple Vision Pro headset. E.l.f. Beauty describes the app as a \"spatial experience\" where users engage with \"playful, inspirational environments that contextualize an assortment of 3D e.l.f. products.\" Users can also purchase products within the app using Apple Pay.
