    "text": "Man Saved By Tesla FSD Max Paul Franklin was saved by Tesla FSD recently and recounts the story as so: On April 1st, Tesla unlocked Full Self-Driving capability for all Tesla vehicles in America. In a moment of dire need, at 2:00 am the following morning, I found myself grappling with severe dehydration and a blood glucose level of 670 due to a malfunction in my insulin pump. With no time to spare, I turned to my Model Y for assistance. Engaging the new Full Self-Driving feature with a simple double click on the steering column stalk, I was astounded by the results. Without any intervention, the car skillfully navigated the 13-mile journey from my home to the VA Emergency Room, offering to autonomously park it upon arrival and let me seek immediate medical attention. Despite enduring a mild heart attack, I left the hospital with no restrictions on my exercise regimen, a testament to the swift and efficient response facilitated by the vehicle and the # 1 VA in America. As an owner of luxury vehicles including Porsche, Mercedes, BMW, Acura, and Cadillac, I can unequivocally declare Tesla the pinnacle of automotive innovation today. Its lifesaving capabilities in critical moments underscore its superiority. The leap from traditional vehicles to Tesla's Full Self-Driving functionality is like upgrading from a basic phone to a smartphone. As a resident of a solar-powered home, the cost of energy for the last 7000 miles has been minimal, I've saved nearly $1000. I extend my gratitude to Elon Musk for his crazy erratic leadership in advancing technology that is more than just transportation. As someone who shares Elon's place \"on the spectrum\", I am particularly appreciative of his commitment to excellence and innovation. He has profoundly impacted our world and personally impacted my own. Thanks, Tesla, and thanks, Charles George VA Medical Center team! Tesla FSD Avoids Oncoming Truck By Driving Up On a Curb To the Right [https://t.co/w3HZZppqXK] [$TSLA] [@Tesla] [@torquenewsauto] [@cgdavemac] [#evs] [#software] [#fsd] [#autonomy] [#safety] — Jeremy Noel Johnson (@AGuyOnlineHere) [April 4, 2024] Elon Musk even responded to the man, saying he was glad Tesla FSD was there to help and that he is feeling well. One could argue that making FSD not accessible - or even delaying its launch could be a moral hazard for those who need their car to drive them and are not able to at the moment. It is also a hazard for those who are on the road and have some kind of heart issue or stroke and need their car to continue driving. FSD will keep the person safe as it continues to improve and does not need intervention. With all this being said, it's important to remember - FSD is not yet autonomous and requires driver intervention where appropriate.

It will also save lives by being able to drive people who are unable to drive themselves, face a medical emergency, or have a medical condition that warrants a car that drives itself. These applications of FSD are the little known ways that it will benefit humanity. The AI can take over in case of an emergency and will also help an aging population drive into their later years. I remember when I had to have my appendix taken out in 2019. That was 5 years ago, and I had to drive myself to the hospital 15 minutes away. It was excruciating. It would have been a lot easier right now in a Tesla that can drive itself, which I am fortunate to have. Tesla FSD - Not Stopping At Better Than Average Human Driving - It's Going For Superhuman Driving: What This Means [https://t.co/VbHJGRrdbV] [$TSLA] [@Tesla] [@torquenewsauto] [#fsd] [#imitationlearning] [#reinforcementlearning] [#ai] [#autonomy] [#superhuman] — Jeremy Noel Johnson (@AGuyOnlineHere) [April 11, 2024] Tesla's FSD software is 8 cameras or \"eyes\" that are always paying attention and improving with each software update. It will never get drunk. Nor distracted. It won't get emotional on the road or angry. The car will always do its very best to get from point a to point b. It treats all people, animals, and living things with the utmost respect. Situations like the one that happened here with Max Paul Franklin will happen in the future, and having a car that can drive itself will be very important. Autonomous technology is here to stay.
