    "text": "SPRINGFIELD, ILL. (WICS) — City Water, Light and Power (CWLP) has earned the American Public Power Association’s Safety Award of Excellence for its Electric Division’s safe operating practices in 2023. The utility earned the Diamond Award in the category for utilities with 250,000 to 999,000 worker-hours annually along with 13 other utilities at the APPA’s Engineering & Operations Conference this week. More than 160 utilities entered the annual Safety Awards for 2023. Entrants were placed in categories according to their number of worker-hours and ranked based on the most incident-free records and overall state of their safety programs and culture during 2023. Doug Brown, CWLP Chief Utility Engineer shared: It’s great that our employees’ efforts to adhere to operating practices that not only meet the goals we have for service, but that also ensure a safe work environment is being recognized. This honor underscores our commitment to prioritize the safety and well-being of our employees as they dedicate themselves to power our community.",
