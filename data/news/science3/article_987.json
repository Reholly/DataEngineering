    "text": "Last Updated on Mini-PCs, despite being, well, mini in size, often aren’t as small in terms of their price. Fortunately, Minisforum has options for every budget, especially now that they’ve released their UN100D model, part of their more affordable Venus Series of diminutive computing machines. According to [Minisforum](https://www.pcguide.com/news/minisforum-teases-a-not-quite-mini-pc-complete-with-a-water-cooling-system/)‘s [product page](https://store.minisforum.com/products/minisforum-un100d?variant=44988920692981), the UN100D is priced at a very budget-friendly $199.00 USD (regional pricing varies) for the base model, which includes 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD. You can also upgrade to a 16GB RAM and 256GB SSD version for $10 more at $209. Finally, there’s a 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD variant that costs $219, which may be the best option out of the lot. Of course, since this is a minimally-priced machine, you shouldn’t expect high-end specs to decorate its interior. Minisforum UN100D is perfect for basic computing tasks The UN100D is equipped with the Intel N100 processor, with 4 cores, 4 threads, and 6MB cache, so don’t expect to do any high-end gaming on this machine. It also only has Intel UHD graphics built-in, further limiting its creative capabilities. However, it does come with plenty of storage options. Aside from including either a 256GB or 512GB M.2 SSD, it also has a 2.5-inch HDD and TF card slot to bolster its data capacity. So, even though you won’t be performing any groundbreaking activities on this device, you’ll at least have a reliable mini-PC to store your most important files on. Overall, the UN100D, though unsurprisingly limited, is ideal for anyone who wants an affordable computer that doesn’t take up a ton of space. With its base models retailing at only $199, finding a better alternative at this price point would undoubtedly be difficult.
