    "text": "Image: Apple Apple announced some Godzilla-sized updates for its streaming service. First up, the spinoff series Monarch: Legacy of Monsters , which premiered on Apple TV Plus last year , has been renewed for a second season. There aren’t any details on what the new season will entail or when it’ll start streaming, but showrunners and co-creators Chris Black and Matt Fraction will be returning.\nOn top of that, Apple says that it has signed a deal with Legendary for even more projects based in its “monsterverse,” which will include “multiple spinoff series.” It’s not clear yet what those series might be, but here’s hoping we get a deep dive into the Shobijin . The news comes just a few weeks after the latest feature in the franchise, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire , hit theaters.\nIt’s been a fairly busy day for Apple TV Plus. In addition to the kaiju news, the streamer also released the first trailer for its upcoming sci-fi thriller Dark Matter , which stars Joel Edgerton and Jennifer Connelly and starts streaming on May 8th.\nSource link",
