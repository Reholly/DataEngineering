    "text": "Record quarterly order volume of $3.7 million and gross margin of 59% 1 Record annual order volume of $10.4 million (79% increase YoY) and gross margin of 61% 1 First significant adjusted quarterly EBITDA profitability 1 Toronto, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - April 11, 2024) - American Aires Inc. (CSE: WIFI) (OTC Pink: AAIRF) (\" Aires \" or the \" Company\" ), a pioneer in cutting-edge technology designed to protect against electromagnetic radiation and optimize human health, is pleased to announce the filing the Company's Financial Statements and Management's Discussion & Analysis (MD&A) for the year ended December 31, 2023 and disclose key performance metrics (non-IFRS and unaudited financial results). To keep financial results comparable on a YoY basis while making them consistent with ongoing and future reporting, all figures below combine the results of Aires and those achieved by HUCK Project LLC (\" HUCK \") pursuant to the Distributor-Royalty agreement initially announced on August 28, 2023 and which has been subsequently terminated by mutual agreement of the parties, as announced on February 16, 2024.\nThe Aires team is proud of its Q4 2023 performance, achieving record order volume of $3.7 million, 1 largely due to enhancements made to Aires' marketing and advertising strategy. The increased order volume represents strong growth YoY (up $1.3 million for 53% growth), while advertising and promotion expenses grew by only a modest $0.3 million YoY as we continue to scale up our growth engine, and marketing costs were slightly reduced by 2% YoY.\nThe record level of quarterly order volume was achieved despite a temporary shortage of product that limited sales. The related supply chain constraint has now been resolved, and the Company has been fully stocked since that time thanks to the negotiation of new supply terms and increased working capital from our recently closed $4 million financing, as announced on February 16, 2024.\nThe Company's most important quarterly achievement was reporting its first significant adjusted quarterly EBITDA profitability at $77,750, which is a milestone that underscores the Company's ongoing strategic delivery of shareholder value. EBITDA adjustments are for inclusion of HUCK results and non-recurring expenses associated with restructuring and other one-time costs. Please see \"Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation Table for Q4/2023\" below for more details.\nThe Aires team is equally proud of its annual performance in 2023 on multiple fronts. The Company drove an impressive order volume increase of 79% YoY to $10.4 million (up from $5.8 million in 2022). The strong order volume financial results are a direct result of the brand-building vision of American Aires CEO, Josh Bruni, and his ability to consistently drive growth, such as 2022's order volume increase of 128% YoY. As with previous years, the main catalyst for revenue growth was Bruni's measured, data-driven and iterative growth engine.\nAmerican Aires CEO, Josh Bruni, commented: \"This success builds on the hard work and sustainable growth we've demonstrated over the past 2 years. These financial results are just the latest proof that we have what it takes to reach and convert the massive and growing consumer market focused on wellbeing and EMF protection. Now it's time to focus on making 2024 our best year ever and continuing our trajectory of significant revenue growth. That means staying the course but with the welcomed advantage of working with a larger budget. That will involve ramping up our predictable growth engine to drive further revenue increases and deepening and widening our relationships with athletes, celebrities and performers to elevate Aires to the level of household brand.\"\nGross margin as a percentage in 2023 was mostly in line at 61% relative to from 2022's level (62%), exemplifying continued focus on optimization of manufacturing and fulfillment costs. Gross margin in dollars increased by 76% YoY to $6.4 million (up from $3.6 million in 2022) on the back of stronger order volumes.\nThe financial results for 2023 demonstrate the effectiveness and ROI of the Company's revamped advertising and promotions approach, which includes expanded spending on social media platforms and further spending on developing affiliate relationships to promote Aires' products. During the year, advertising and promotion spend increased by only $1.3 million YoY compared to an annual YoY increase in order volume that was 3.4x greater ($4.6 million).\nMarketing expenses remained relatively stable with a modest 8% YoY increase to $2.1 million. The expenses are based on contracts with a number of marketing agencies that provide services based on a fee as opposed to commissions. As a result, marketing expenses are not expected to increase in the same proportion to sales.\nOverhead costs for the year remained flat at $1.9 million. Largely non-recurring legal and professional fees increased mainly related to an increased use of legal firms during the year for capital raising events and restructuring activities. In contrast, the Company diligently drove down office and general costs by 5% and consulting and payroll expenses by 7%, demonstrating our commitment to efficiency and to creating value for Aires shareholders.\nAmerican Aires Chief Financial Officer, Vitaliy Savitsky, commented: \"American Aires is a young high-growth company, so a lot of my focus has been on disciplining growth, measuring effectiveness of ad spend, and reducing costs. That strategy paid off tremendously in 2023 with its difficult year in the capital markets. Instead of losing ground, we focused on hitting adjusted EBITDA profitability and on growing sustainably. I'm very excited about scaling up the business in existing markets and expanding internationally in 2024 and beyond with this disciplined approach. That's our strategy and vision for further strengthening our industry leader status and delivering more shareholder value.\"\nDetailed breakdown of preliminary, non-IFRS, unaudited figures\nDue to the HUCK agreement being in effect since August 28, 2023 and for the entire Q4 2023, the Company realized the economic benefit from the sale of its products in the form of royalty and credit reimbursement rather than the typical formula of revenues less cost of goods sold (\" COGS \"), less advertising and promotion, less marketing and other expenses. As a result, accounting rules required revenues, COGS, advertising and promotion, marketing and certain other expenses to be allocated to HUCK during this period. The Company reported cash royalty income and credit reimbursement income for 2024 in the amounts of $283,427 and $197,183, respectively, or $480,610 combined. Management believes that the overall net income effect of the HUCK agreement on the Company's bottom line was negligible in 2024 as HUCK realized neither profit nor loss from the distribution partnership. However, to keep investors well informed and be able to compare results with prior years and future quarters, since the HUCK agreement was terminated as of January 1, 2024, the Company is pleased to provide certain relevant metrics on a combined basis, removing the effect of the HUCK agreement to demonstrate the true state of operations.

Non-IFRS measures are used by management to assess the financial and operational performance of the Company. The Company believes that these Non-IFRS measures, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, enable investors to evaluate the Company's operating results, underlying performance and prospects in a similar manner to the Company's management.

Accordingly, these Non-IFRS measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. The Corporation defines EBITDA as earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation.
