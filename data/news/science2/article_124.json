    "text": "Deadpool 3 continues to generate a great deal of excitement among fans. We know it will be a reality-hopping adventure of some sort, though what ramifications it will have for the wider Multiverse Saga remains to be seen.\nMuch of the action is expected to take place in Fox's X-Men Universe, explaining rumours that Cassandra Nova - Professor X's twisted twin sister - will be the threequel's big bad. The Crown 's Emma Corrin is rumoured to be playing the character and we now have new details about what to expect.\nAccording to scooper @CanWeGetToast , Cassandra will look exactly like she does in the comics. That includes a bald head, a white shirt, a corset, and a brown trench coat with high-waisted tan pants and a brown belt (similar to the image below).\nAs well as psychic and telekinetic abilities, Nova can reportedly open portals. We're assuming that means she can travel between realities similar to America Chavez, but it may just be a teleportation-like power.\nFinally, it's said a chase scene was recently shot in the UK in a location made to look like New York City. Nova was supposedly chasing Deadpool and Wolverine with her portals, so we're guessing they are indeed used as a means of transport.\nIn the comics, she's a \"Mummudrai,\" a spirit that's considered the equal and opposite of a person in Shi'ar culture. However, given Charles Xavier's incredibly powerful latent mutant powers, his Mummudrai took on a physical form in the womb as his \"twin.\"\nThe baby Charles instinctively recognised her as a threat and the ensuing battle saw his and Cassandra's mother miscarry the X-Men leader's sister.\nIt was later revealed she'd survived as a mass of cells in a sewer wall (seriously), managing to build a body for herself while planning the ultimate revenge on Charles. That included taking his place and the murder of 16 million mutants by unleashing giant Sentinels on the nation of Genosha.\nAlongside Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, Deadpool franchise vets Karan Soni (Dopinder), Leslie Uggams (Blind Al), Morena Baccarin (Vanessa), Stefan Kapicic (Colossus), Brianna Hildebrand (Negasonic Teenage Warhead), Shioli Kutsuna (Yukio), and Rob Delaney (Peter) are all confirmed to return in Deadpool 3 .\nAs noted, Emma Corrin is expected to play Cassandra Nova, while Matthew Macfadyen will likely take on the role of a TVA agent named Paradox. The trades have confirmed that Jennifer Garner will reprise her role as Elektra, with Wesley Snipes, James Marsden, Famke Janssen, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Dafne Keen, and even singer Taylor Swift among those rumoured to make cameo appearances.\nDeadpool 3 is set to be released in theaters on July 26, 2024.",
