    "text": "In only three years, this century’s Roaring ’20s has already proved to be one of the most exciting decades in the automotive world, despite adversities including a pandemic and the ensuing supply chain issues that slowed the entire world down. As we head into 2024, we realize we’ve only just begun to see what this decade has to offer automotive history. The 2020s mark an important turning point in the automotive world, as the industry transitions towards electrification, and manufacturers lay out decadelong plans as to how it’s going to happen. As 2023 comes to a close, and the middle of the decade approaches, those efforts are beginning to ramp up in pace. But the industry isn’t ready to let go of combustion engines just yet — 2024 has hybrids and combustion-powered cars in store, as well. Regardless of what manufacturers or kinds of cars you’re anticipating, there are certainly plenty of thrills to come. [Porsche](https://www.dupontregistry.com/autos/results/porsche) is one of the most popular purveyors of performance luxury cars, and its SUV models — the [Cayenne](https://www.dupontregistry.com/autos/results/porsche/cayenne) and Macan — are leading the charge. As Porsche transforms its lineup, a new electric version of the Macan is set to be revealed in 2024. It will sit alongside the Taycan as Porsche’s second fully electric model. Automakers that came on the scene as electric vehicle manufacturers are also seizing the opportunity to expand their lineups and further cement themselves in the highly competitive EV arena. Lucid and Polestar are two of the most prominent examples. Next year, Lucid is set to reveal its Gravity SUV, the first SUV in the brand’s lineup, and Polestar will reveal the Polestar 5, its performance-oriented four-door GT that has been hinted at in the brand’s Precept concept car. Meanwhile, [Maserati](https://www.dupontregistry.com/autos/results/maserati) has revealed the GranTurismo, along with the first-ever GranTurismo Folgore electric version. The Italian marque is also on the cusp of introducing a new version of the GranCabrio, with photos of the prototype version of its upcoming open-top grand tourer published and Trident fans anticipating its arrival. Other grand touring models set to be revealed come from Bentley, as the brand has promised hybrid versions of all of its models by 2024, with only the hybrid Continental GT and GTC remaining. This coincides with the bittersweet end of production for Bentley’s iconic W12 engine in April 2024. In the supercar realm, tides are changing too, as anticipation and speculation builds for the latest from brands like [Ferrari](https://www.dupontregistry.com/autos/results/ferrari), [Lamborghini](https://www.dupontregistry.com/autos/results/lamborghini), and Bugatti. As Lamborghini revealed its first production hybrid, the Revuelto, this year, spy shots have suggested that more are coming soon, like possible hybrid versions of the Lamborghini Huracán and Urus. The Prancing Horse is also busy, with rumors swirling about a successor to the legendary LaFerrari hybrid hypercar. With Bugatti under new ownership with the Bugatti Rimac group, a successor to the unfathomable Chiron could be on the horizon. As an industry that continues to drive forward at breakneck speed, there’s no telling what the automotive world will look like in the future, which is exactly what makes coming into 2024 such an exciting prospect.
