    "text": "Sony confirms highly anticipated upcoming PS5 games in 2024 By Justin Diaz January 05, 2024 Sony is turning on the hype machine and cranking things up to eleven with a new PlayStation trailer that showcases upcoming PS5 games for 2024. In it, you get brief snippets of a bunch of different games that are highly anticipated by players. Including some we haven’t heard much about for quite some time. Titles like Stellar Blade, which is an upcoming PS5 exclusive, get shown off pretty close to the beginning of the trailer.\nThis is a game that Sony announced well over a year ago but hasn’t confirmed exactly when it would be released. In fact, Sony and the development studio were quiet on any information surrounding Stellar Blade for a long time. This caused some PS5 owners to wonder if the game was still in active development. The new trailer confirms it’ll be landing sometime this year. Although it’s still unknown what the official launch date is. It was supposed to come out in 2023 but it was delayed to 2024 . Advertisement Advertisement\nStellar Blade is far from the only big game dropping on PS5 this year though. And the trailer hypes up more than a few of those games. Some of which do have official release dates.\nThe PS5 upcoming games trailer confirms Metal Gear Solid Delta will be released this year In Sony’s official PlayStation Blog post from December 28, the company highlights a handful of big games for 2024. Including the above-mentioned Stellar Blade, Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth, Tekken 8, Hell Divers 2, and Rise of Ronin. Other than Stellar Blade, all of those other games are confirmed to launch before the end of March. One game the blog doesn’t mention is Metal Gear Solid Delta. However, the trailer from January 4, which you can watch below, shows Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater as a 2024 release.\nThings could change, of course. As it was only just announced in May of last year . Konami hasn’t said much about the state of the game’s development so it’s not clear how far along things are. But Sony is confirming a 2024 release. However, that doesn’t mean it’ll be coming anytime soon. If it had an official date it would have been mentioned by now. So there’s a good chance the release date is towards the end of the year.\nThe trailer also showcases the Silent Hill 2 remake and The Last Of Us Part II: Remastered. In short, 2024 is going to be a great year for game releases on PlayStation. Although many of these games will also be released on Xbox Series X|S and PC. So it’ll be a great year for game releases all around.",
