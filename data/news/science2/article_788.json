    "text": "Well, it’s a new year, but the game in Silicon Valley remains very much the same. That game, in essence, involves doing anything and everything to convince you—the global consumer—that whatever hair-brained product Bay Area billionaires have cooked up is a must-have. Unfortunately, the tech industry has bet its money on a lot of stupid shit over the last several years—whether it’s fake internet money that requires ungodly amounts of electricity to generate or NFTs or pizza made by a robot or, more recently, a host of automated tools that you never asked for. As you already know, AI is the hottest industry in tech right now, and, in 2024, that industry promises to continue churning out a host of new, sometimes useful, sometimes baffling, often deeply wasteful and stupid products. Whether its an ever escalating war over who can create the coolest chatbot or attempts to popularize music wholly generated by software, or a race to make human physical labor obsolete and thus kill off yet another upwardly mobile middle class strata of work, the tech industry is sure to be blasting on all cylinders this year. Here’s a little look at what’s been happening so far.\nAdvertisement",
