The device also includes a portable modem, allowing the user to access the Internet almost anywhere and make calls.\nThe device is based on the Android 13 system, which allows for a smooth and easy user experience, and Teclast has not installed excessive applications or annoying advertising applications. Despite its low price, the device comes with a metal body that looks elegant with its bright blue color and is considered fairly stable.\nHowever, there are some disadvantages that should be pointed out. For example, cameras cannot be used to take pictures well due to the blurry and lack of clarity of the pictures. Although the tabletâ€™s performance capabilities are still sufficient for daily use, they may be limited for this price category. The 6,000 mAh battery can take a long time to charge, and once fully charged the tablet may not last as long as some competitors.\nFrequently asked questions\nDoes the Teclast M50 HD include mobile internet?\nYes, the device includes a portable modem that allows the user to access the Internet almost anywhere.\nDoes the device come with a high-resolution screen?\nYes, the Teclast M50 HD has a full-width HD display and supports streaming HD content.\nDoes the device support external memory?\nYes, external memory cards can be used to add additional storage space to your Teclast M50 HD.",
