Cloud-based project management software typically requires users to pay a subscription fee. The cost of the subscription can be based on the user's specific needs, such as custom features, storage capacity, remote access, and advanced support. On the other hand, cloud-based portfolio management software is generally expensive and the price often varies based on the number of users. Although the initial cost of cloud-based applications tends to be lower than on-premises applications, over time the costs can add up. This is because suppliers often require annual or quarterly orders to grow their customer base, which results in additional charges for extra services.\nLearn about additional key drivers, trends, and challenges available with Technavio.
