    "text": "With over 30 years of experience and a robust network with domestic universities and general hospitals, HP&C Ltd. has established a solid foundation in research and development. HP&C Ltd., a specialist in the production and sale of pharmaceuticals, quasi-drugs, and cosmetics, is accelerating its journey towards becoming the 'Global Best Skin Health Care Company' by focusing on customer health and beauty. Incorporating the concepts of Health, Pharmaceuticals, and Cosmetics, HP&C Ltd. operates a diverse business portfolio across four categories: cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, disinfectants, and medical devices. Since its inception in 1993, HP&C has been committed to introducing cosmeceutical products in Korea, achieving various certifications and patents through continuous innovation and effort. In 2014, the company completed a factory in Osong Life Science Park, complying with CGMP, KGMP, ISO 22716, ISO 9001, and ISO 13485 standards, ensuring the production of high-quality and reliable products. Kim Hong-sook, the CEO of HP&C, believes in the importance of securing numerous patents through R&D to lay the foundation for product production. Accordingly, the company invests about 5% of its total sales in R&D for new developments. The Thelavicos Hyaltoning Skin Booster, formulated to be skin-friendly, minimizes irritation while enhancing moisture and brightening skin tone, is one of their notable products. HP&C has also launched hospital-grade disinfectants, fillers, and skin boosters, and established production facilities for these products, gaining significant attention from clients interested in OEM and ODM for fillers, skin boosters, and medical devices. The company offers a range of medical devices designed to restore facial volume, reduce wrinkles and fine lines, and enhance facial features and youthfulness. These include a Grade 4 medical device, three types of Uptive Lidocaine fillers, Grade 1 medical devices for wound protection eligible for Silbi insurance in hospitals, and three types of Thelavicos Zeroskin MD Lotion and Cream. HP&C's success in the market can be attributed to its in-house research and development, networking with domestic university laboratories and dermatologists, and collaborative research with foreign partners. This approach has led to the development of new materials, technologies, and formulations, ensuring that only products with proven efficacy and safety are offered. Moreover, the company has responded proactively to the rapidly changing market by implementing strict quality control and introducing automated production facilities. HP&C stated, \"Our ability to develop outstanding products, automated facilities, and rigorous quality control has helped us establish ourselves as a trusted professional company in producing cosmetics, disinfectants, and medical devices. We are actively addressing the OEM and ODM market to advance towards our vision of becoming the 'Global Best Skin Health Care Company'.\" https://www.instagram.com/thelavicos_korea/ Media Contact Company Name: HP&C Ltd.
