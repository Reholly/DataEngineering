    "text": "Meese 6.8-inch Folding Touchscreen Car Display $96 $160 Save $64\nFor Android Auto users, the Mace's foldable touchscreen display offers an intuitive and safe way to use your phone while driving. Packed with features like rearview camera support, hands-free voice assistant and multiple ways to connect including Bluetooth, you'll be able to stay connected without taking your eyes off the road.\nIf you're like me and you have an older car that doesn't have any kind of display, chances are you're probably not very familiar with Android Auto and how useful it can be. When synced with an Android phone, Android Auto essentially uses your car's infotainment system to provide access to your phone's smart features like navigation apps, voice assistants, and more.\nThe downside is that, if your car doesn't have an infotainment system or built-in display, you have no way to access these features without picking up your phone while driving (something no one should do, Like, ever). However, there are external displays you can get, like the Mace 6.8-inch foldable touchscreen, that lets you take full advantage of your phone without taking your eyes off the road.\nWhy this Mace foldable touchscreen with Android Auto support deal is worth it There are lots of ways to make driving a more pleasant experience on your phone, right? Navigation apps and systems, listening to your favorite music and podcasts through Spotify playlists, you name it. However, with no way to access any of these through the display in your vehicle, you'll have to take your eyes off the road and go through your phone.\nThis is not only dangerous, but also cumbersome to say the least, making it quite difficult to swap between songs, check messages or turn on navigation when you're not entirely sure where you're going. Have been. Getting an Android Auto enabled display allows you to access your phone's features in a safer and more intuitive way via touch screen or voice commands while driving.\nThe best thing about Meese's option is that it can connect to your phone in multiple ways, including syncing via Bluetooth, hands-free use via Google Assistant, and voice commands. You can also mirror your phone's display to it using Screen Cast, allowing you to instantly access your favorite apps, check messages, make calls, and more.\nWe've written an explainer explaining what Android Auto can do, but think of it as a pseudo-smart system for your car. Most new vehicles have either Android Auto or Apple CarPlay support built-in, which connects to a compatible phone to provide its features directly through the car. However, older cars usually don't have any of this, so a display like the Meese opens up a lot of ways to help you stay connected during a trip.\nPrices for these displays can vary, and typically, Meese costs about $160 out of pocket. Expensive to say the least, but it's an investment that's worth it in the long run. So, with it priced at just under $96 on StackSocial, this is a must-have accessory for anyone looking to upgrade their car with additional connectivity at a good price.\nSource ",
