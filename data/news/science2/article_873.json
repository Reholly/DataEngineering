These include:\nThe PC14586 clinical program will be led by Deepika Jalota, Pharm.D. and Marc Fellous, M.D. Dr. Jalota and Dr. Fellous succeed Leila Alland, M.D., who is stepping down to pursue other opportunities.

Leila's clinical development expertise was instrumental in the excellent execution of our Phase 1 study for PC14586, and due to her leadership we are well positioned to initiate our registrational Phase 2 study this quarter. Winston has been an incredible partner in building the PMV team during the past six years. He played a critical role in leading our initial public offering in 2020 and has contributed across multiple functions, well beyond building an excellent G&A organization.\"\n\"We are fortunate to have a deep bench of experienced individuals to drive the development of PC14586. Deepika has proven to be one of the strongest CDOs in the industry with a track record of successful clinical development and drug approvals in oncology, including tumor agnostic drugs such as larotrectinib. Combined with Marc's experience in global drug development and regulatory approvals, we are well positioned to drive PMV's next phase of growth. I also want to congratulate Mike, Rob, and Tim in their new and expanded roles at PMV.
