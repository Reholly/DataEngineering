    "text": "- Recognized for excellence in augmented reality technology, apps, and device sets. - To be showcased at the CES 2024 booth... with a new Disney product launch planned for the first half of the year. Woongjin Thinkbig's ARpedia, a global edutech product, has won the 'CES 2024 Innovation Award', marking the first time a Korean educational company has achieved this honor three times in a row. Leading the global education market as a pioneering edutech solution, ARpedia has demonstrated its unique augmented reality technology and innovation. ARpedia, developed by Woongjin Thinkbig, one of Korea's leading edutech companies, is an 'Interactive Book' that provides a three-dimensional reading experience by bringing characters and illustrations from books to life through augmented reality (AR) technology. In Korea, it's a popular series with over 6 million individual books sold. Internationally, it has proven its market potential with contracts to supply at least 80,000 sets annually in the Chinese-speaking region (China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau). This achievement is largely attributed to the global recognition of ARpedia's unique technology and educational effectiveness. At CES 2024, ARpedia won the 'Mobile Devices and Accessories' innovation award, securing its third consecutive title. This particular win is noteworthy as it acknowledges the excellence of ARpedia in all aspects of its set, including augmented reality technology (CES 2023, AR/VR category), apps (CES 2022-2023, Mobile Apps category), and devices (CES 2024). Woongjin Thinkbig plans to introduce ARpedia to business representatives and visitors from various countries at CES 2024. Attendees will have the opportunity to explore all series that comprise the ARpedia set and learn in detail about the products' features and usage. Furthermore, Woongjin Thinkbig is set to launch a new reading series, 'Disney Interactive Reading', in the first half of this year, based on a licensing agreement with Walt Disney. The initial marketing strategy will focus on Asian countries, where there is high demand for English reading education. Sam-rak Choi, the head of Woongjin Thinkbig's EduTech Research Institute, commented, \"ARpedia is sought after by companies and educational industry representatives in 24 countries where it is currently exported. With various new products including Disney Interactive Reading slated for release this year, it is poised to establish itself as a global representative edutech product”. ▲ Introduction of ARpedia ARpedia, an experiential reading product that provides a three-dimensional reading experience through augmented reality (AR) technology, was launched in Korea in 2019 under the 'Interactive Book' brand. Targeting the international market, the English version of 'ARpedia' has received much acclaim and several global awards, including being the first Korean educational company to win the 'CES Innovation Award' three times in a row. In 2022 alone, ARpedia won the 'Kid’s Judge BETT', 'Mom’s Choice Award', and 'Teacher’s Choice Award', proving its success with children, parents, and teachers alike. In July 2023, Woongjin Thinkbig signed a licensing agreement with global entertainment giant Walt Disney for the launch of the Disney series.
