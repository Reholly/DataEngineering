    "text": "Image by author Have you ever wanted to study computer science but didn't want to pay the high cost of college tuition? Well, you're in luck! There is an incredible open-source course called OSSU (Open Source Society University) that allows you to enroll in the equivalent of a 4-year computer science degree program, completely free. OSSU/Computer-Science provides a holistic education in fundamental computer science concepts for all computing disciplines. The curriculum is designed in accordance with the degree requirements of undergraduate computer science majors at leading universities. It uses high-quality courses from platforms like edX, Coursera, and Udacity, taught by professors from schools like MIT, Harvard, and Princeton. Image from ossu/computer-science The curriculum covers everything from programming languages, algorithms and data structures to operating systems, computer architecture and software engineering. After completing core CS requirements, you can choose advanced electives to specialize in areas such as software testing, game theory, linear algebra, and others. The best part is that all the course materials are available online for free, and you can complete the program at your own pace. Although it is possible to finish in 2 years if you study about 20 hours per week, you can adjust depending on your schedule. You also join a worldwide community of independent learners who support each other. Prerequisites The pre-requisites at different stages of the Computer Science course are: - Core CS: Students must have a prior high school level mathematics background, including algebra, geometry, and pre-calculus. - Advanced CS: Students may choose advanced electives only after first completing all required courses in the core CS section. - advanced System: Any student wishing to specialize in the Advanced Systems elective must first take at least one basic physics course in high school or college. intro cs The Intro CS section contains beginner-level courses that help students new to computer science understand if it is a good fit for them. It includes introductory programming to teach basic coding concepts and introductory computer science to provide students with an understanding of the role of computation in solving problems. core cs The core CS section contains all the courses equivalent to the first 3 years of a university computer science degree. It builds a strong foundation in essential areas such as: - Core Programming: This includes languages, testing, design patterns, architecture, etc. - basic math: Builds mathematical maturity required for data structures, algorithms etc. - CS Tools: Introduces commonly used tools for tasks like version control, shell scripting, etc. - Core System: Deals with OS, networking, compilation and computer architecture. - Basic principles: Fundamental theoretical concepts like algorithms, NP-completeness, etc. - Main Security: Secure coding, cryptography, and vulnerabilities. - Main applications: Database, Machine Learning, Computer Graphics, etc. - Basic Ethics: Explores the ethical implications of technology in society. advanced cs After completing all required core CS courses, students should select additional advanced CS courses based on their interests and desired field. - Advanced Programming: Covers topics such as debugging, parallel computing, UML, software architecture, compilers, functional programming with Haskell and much more. - advanced System: Goes in-depth into digital logic, computer organization, pipelining, parallel processing, virtualization, and other lower-level computing concepts. - Advanced Theory: Covers formal language theory, Turing machines, computation, concurrent models, computational geometry, logic, and game theory. - Advanced Information Security: Provides more specific security knowledge such as compliance, digital forensics, secure development lifecycle, and verification. - advanced mathematics: It includes linear algebra, numerical methods, formal logic, probability theory, and other important mathematical foundations for computer science. final project The final project requires students to apply all of their learning by building something useful. It provides concrete evidence of their knowledge and skills to demonstrate to potential employers. Creating a project not only looks good on a resume but also validates and reinforces your knowledge. You can create something new from scratch or contribute to an existing open-source project that needs help. For further guidance, structured course specializations focused on projects you can pursue are available. Topics include full-stack development, data science, robotics, and beyond. With the basics in place, you can now identify the series that match your interests. When your final project is complete, submit its information to OSSU Projects via a pull request. Also, add the OSSU badge to your project README. Then, use community channels to announce your creation to fellow students. Assessment is done by receiving feedback from peers and demonstrating abilities, rather than traditional grading. It also allows OSSU to evaluate how well its curriculum prepares independent learners for real achievement. The OSSU Computer Science degree program provides a great opportunity for those who are interested in studying computer science without the burden of high tuition fees. With a well-structured curriculum that covers all the fundamental concepts of computer science, you can get a comprehensive education in this field. The flexibility of the program allows you to learn at your own pace, making it an accessible option for anyone, no matter their schedule. So why wait? Start your computer science education with OSSU for free today. abid ali awan (@1abidaliawan) is a certified data scientist professional who loves building machine learning models.
