    "text": "Which light therapy boxes for seasonal affective disorder are best? Many people feel a little down in the fall and winter when the days get shorter and sunlight is harder to come by. But for some, the depression that sets in is more than simple “winter blues.” If you find yourself in a funk every fall and winter, you may have seasonal affective disorder.\nFortunately, light therapy often helps treat SAD by providing artificial light similar to sunlight that can change chemicals in the brain linked to mood. If your doctor has recommended light therapy, here are the best light therapy boxes for treating SAD and helping you get back to feeling like yourself.\nSeasonal affective disorder and light therapy 101 What is seasonal affective disorder? According to the Mayo Clinic , SAD is a type of depression brought about by changes in the seasons. In most cases, the symptoms start in the fall and continue through to the end of winter. Some people can experience summer SAD, though, so their symptoms begin in the spring and continue through the summer.\nSAD symptoms include a lack of energy, difficulty concentrating, loss of interest in hobbies you usually enjoy, overeating, weight gain and oversleeping. You may be at greater risk for SAD if you have a family history of the disorder, live far from the equator, have low vitamin D levels or have depression or bipolar disorder. While it’s normal to occasionally feel down, you should see a doctor if you experience symptoms that last for days at a time or start affecting your daily activities.\nHow does light therapy work? Light therapy is often one of the first treatments recommended for SAD. Just after waking in the morning, you sit in front of a light therapy lamp that produces bright light similar to natural light to help improve your mood and energy.\nLight therapy typically only takes a few days to work. It usually doesn’t have many side effects, either. In most cases, you should use the light box 20 to 30 minutes daily, positioning it approximately 15 to 25 inches from your face.\nBut before you invest in a light therapy box, it’s a good idea to talk to your doctor to determine what features and options are most important for your treatment. Always read the manufacturer’s directions for your light box for the best way to use it, too.\nBest light therapy boxes Best light therapy boxes under $40 [ Wobrikosee Light Therapy Lamp ]\nThis simple, easy-to-use light therapy box offers three brightness levels and two lighting modes.
