    "text": "310th SW cyber security civilian wins AFRC award for contributions to the ISR community Published Jan. 5, 2024 By Airman 1st Class Aaron Ketcham 310th Space Wing SCHRIEVER SPACE FORCE BASE, Colo. -- As the only space wing within the Air Force Reserve Command, the 310th Space Wing is continuously working to find innovative ways to improve support of space operations. 310th intelligence reconnaissance surveillance airmen face their own set of challenges within this endeavor. Erick Herzberg, the 310th SW information systems and security officer, has been pivotal in these efforts, creating qualitive solutions to these challenges by bringing new capabilities to the 310th ISR Airmen. Access to software that provides critical training opportunities and mission ready capabilities has not always been a guarantee for intel personnel within the wing, said Lt. Col. Nickolas Demakakos, senior intelligence officer, 310th Space Wing. 310th ISR Airmen are currently integrating with their active-duty counter parts within the Space Force to further inject themselves within space operations, but also relies on access to their software systems. “We had to beg to borrow time on their systems,” said Demakakos. “These were necessary capabilities that we needed for training and readiness and didn’t have unlimited access to. Mr. Herzberg is currently working on a three-network solution to implement a space modeling simulation and visualization software saving the wing roughly $150,000 in installations cost,” said Demakakos. “Not only will this save the wing money, but it delivers capability that has been missing for years.” In June, for his contributions to the 310th ISR mission, Herzberg has awarded the Air Force Reserve Command Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance contributor of the year award for 2023. “It was a surprise,” said Herzberg. “For me it’s not really about the award or accomplishments, but how I can best support the wing.” Herzberg was instrumental in communication efforts for ISR, implementing protocols that established a secure communications network across Vandenberg, Schriever, Peterson and Buckley, creating continuity between the bases that had previously been unavailable, said Demakakos. “Eric has been invaluable helping achieve our communication strategy for ISR within the wing,” said Demakakos. “Thanks to his efforts we’re now able to ensure connectivity and communicate in ways that we were unable to do before.”",
