    "text": "Riot Games has gone all out on the design and features of the new Valorant Kuronami bundle, primed to take the spotlight in Episode 8 Act 1. The new Valorant bundle was leaked by data miners ValorLeaks and ValorINTEL, showing all the new skins, variants, and inspect animations . The centerpiece of the new skin collection is an all-new chained kunai melee — a new knife that’s sure to make players feel like Scorpion from Mortal Kombat. The Kuronami skin bundle is expected to be priced between 7,000 and 10,000 Valorant Points (VP). It will hit Valorant’s in-game store on January 11 at 8 a.m. GMT+8, 12 a.m. GMT, January 10 at 7 p.m. ET, and 4 p.m. PT. With striking skins for the Marshall, Melee, Sheriff, Spectre, and Vandal, the bundle ensures a stylish presence on the battlefield. The Kuronami skins boast four stylish color variations: gray and blue, purple and gold, white, and black. The highlight is the Kuronami finisher, summoning a storm to trap the last eliminated opponent in a watery prison, providing a new elemental spectacle at the end of the round. The Kuronami player card also boasts a unique water effect, and the accompanying gun buddy features a kill counter, adding a notch each time the player eliminates an opponent in the round. The Kuronami bundle, with its all-new features and eye-catching design variations, has the potential to be the best collection in Valorant.
