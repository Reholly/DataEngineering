Just be prepared to spend $20 to get this new gun.\nCall of Duty games released in the last few years have frustrated fans with a prompt asking them to restart the game due to an update. This message often appears before jumping into the main menu. While on console this restart might only take a few seconds, PC players might have to wait a minute or more before they can start playing. It’s been a problem since at least 2020 and is still a thing in MWIII and battle royale spin-off Warzone. The message has become so ubiquitous over the years that it has become a meme within the CoD community. And Activision is ready to laugh at itself while taking some money from you, too.\nRead more\nRam Will Still Sell You A Brand-New, 16-Year-Old Truck\nThese Are The Black Celebs Who Were Named On Jeffrey Epstein's List\nSeth MacFarlane Just Gave New Hope to Orville Fans Across the Galaxy\nGoogle Just Disabled Cookies for 30 Million Chrome Users.

Plus, the Arcade Rhythm SMG comes with a neat pixel-death effect that basically de-rezzes everyone you kill, Tron style. And it even features pixelated muzzle smoke, which is a nice touch.\nOnce again Call of Duty keeps tempting me with cool retro video game skins and weapons, like that Doom shotgun from last year . And once again I have to hold strong. I’m already spending too much money on Fortnite. I can’t afford another battle royale in my life.\n.\nMore from Kotaku\nRemember When Katt Williams Destroyed Wanda Smith on Her Own Radio Show?\nPatrick Stewart Says a Picard Star Trek Movie Is in the Works\nTesla Reverses on Bold Claims of Range and Full Self-Driving\nPlagiarism Can Kill A Career If You Are Black, But Not if You Are These White People\nConsumer Reports Says These Are The Best Hybrid Cars For Less Than $35,000 In 2024\nSign up for Kotaku's Newsletter.
