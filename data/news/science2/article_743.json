    "text": "Steam 8 new free games you can download and play this weeken Published | Last updated Featured Image Credit: Valve It's not exactly a hot take to say January sucks balls. Big sweaty, greasy balls. Big sweaty, greasy balls attached to a goat that broke out of a local farm and impaled several children in a horrific incident. January is the worst, basically. While most people choose to get through January by inexplicably resolving to do less of whatever makes them happy, I choose to double down on what I love: video games. Fortunately, over on [Steam](https://www.gamingbible.com/steam), there's a whole mess of great [free games and demos](https://www.gamingbible.com/free-games) you can check out right now. Shall we take a look at some? Check out one of Steam's most beautiful looking upcoming games below! It even has a free demo. Loadingâ€¦ Steam is constantly adding free demos for you to download and play, so today I thought we'd go through eight of the most recent ones that caught my eye. These are just demos, to be clear, although if you're after full games [you can get plenty of those too. ](https://www.gamingbible.com/news/platform/steam/steam-30-free-games-download-keep-now-790605-20240102) If you're just after a lil' teaser, however, these free demos should be of interest to you: [Footgun: Underground](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2206240/Footgun_Underground)- A gorgeous pixel art roguelike soccer game, I'm not sure how this wasn't on my radar before. [PlatinumS](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2753950/PlatinumS)- Another roguelike! Can you have too many roguelikes? Steam doesn't seem to think so. [Galaxy Too Far](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2751010/Galaxy_Too_Far)- \"Take all resources you can reach, build a logistic web to bring them into your world.\" [Cyber-Assassin](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2612730/CYBERASSASSIN)- A Cyberpunk action game that looks like a real PS2-era throwback. And I mean that as a compliment. [Circle Hitter](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1335940/Circle_Hitter)- A bullet hell game that looks genuinely impossible to put down. [Catch Them Sweetie](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2633210/Catch_Them_Sweetie)- An adorable looking fishing-themed deckbuilder. [Lost In Dread](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2687700/Lost_in_Dread)- A first-person horror experience, not for the faint of heart. [Summer at the Edge of the Universe](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2641720/Summer_at_the_Edge_of_the_Universe)- An incredibly wholesome visual novel about falling in love. So there you have it! Get stuck in, and maybe you'll find a great new game to add to your 2024 radar. Topics: [Steam](/steam), [Free Games](/free-games), [Valve](/valve), [PC](/pc), [Indie Games](/indie-games)",
