    "text": "12 Face Moisturizers, Creams, and Oils Approved by the National Eczema Association\nStocksy/ Guille Faingold Explore the SHOP\nIf you have\neczema, you have to be very careful about which products you put on your face. Luckily, the National Eczema Association (NEA) has a full directory of products they’ve given the eczema-safe Seal of Acceptance. The list contains a wide variety of recommended face moisturizers, creams, and oils at different price points. Best of all, they're chock full of ingredients that are safe and beneficial for irritated, itchy skin. If eczematic flare-ups are a problem for you, our list of NEA-approved face moisturizers for eczema is here to help.\nThe Best Face Moisturizers for Eczema, at a Glance:\nTatcha, The Indigo Cream, $25 SkinClinical, Extreme Healing Repair Cream, $29 CLn Facial Moisturizer, $35 Abby Rose, Soothe-X Face & Body Oil, $18 Pacifica, Vegan Ceramide Barrier Cream, $18 CeraVe, SPF 50 Sunscreen Face Lotion, $15 Avéne, XeraCalm A.D. Lipid-Replenishing Cream, $36 Eczema Honey, Original Skin Soothing Cream, $30 Zo Skin Health, Hydrating Cream, $120 Avene, Soothing Eye Contour Cream, $32 La Roche-Posay, Lipikar Eczema Soothing Relief Cream, $16 Skinfix, Eczema+ Dermatitis Relief Balm, $45\nWhat Makes a Moisturizer Good for Eczema?\nEczema-prone skin is very sensitive to\ncertain ingredients, like isopropyl alcohol, lactic acid, and fragrance. In order to receive the Seal of Acceptance, products undergo rigorous testing to ensure they're free of known eczema irritants. The list includes (but is not limited to):\n- Added fragrance\n- Chemical UV absorbers\n- Benzocaine (a topical anesthetic)\n- Citrus extract\n- Formaldehyde and formaldehyde releasers\nInstead, eczema-friendly formulas focus on hydrating ingredients like ceramides, emollients (like colloidal oatmeal or jojoba oil), and humectants (like hyaluronic acid, honey, or glycerin). They're fragrance-free, and may also include\nanti-inflammatory ingredients like niacinamide or aloe vera.\nHow to Test a Moisturizer for Eczema\nWhile products that hold the NEA's Seal of Acceptance, it's important to remember that everyone's skin is different. While the chances of NEA-approved products irritating eczema-prone skin is low, it's not impossible. \"The first time you apply a new product use a small amount (about the size of a pea) to the pulse of your wrist or the crook of your elbow,\"\nadvises the National Eczema Association. \"Do not wash the area for 24 to 48 hours and watch for any allergic reaction such as redness, a rash, any form of breakouts on the skin, itchiness, pain, flaking, etc.\"\nShop 12 Face Moisturizers for Eczema, Approved by the NEA\nTatcha, The Indigo Cream — $25.00\nThis velvety-rich cream is designed to tackle dryness and uneven texture on sensitive, eczema-prone skin. The star ingredient is natural Japanese Indigo extract, which calms and soothes skin, along with colloidal oatmeal to help relieve minor skin irritation and itching, and Hadasei-3, a trinity of anti-aging Japanese superfoods.\nSkinCinical, Extreme Healing Repair Concentrate — $29.00\nThe SkinClinical Extreme Healing Repair Concentrate is designed to immediately soothe and repair damaged skin by strengthening the skin’s natural\nmoisture barrier. In addition to soothing eczema-prone skin, this moisturizer also works for people with psoriasis, rosacea, diabetic ulcers, scars, burns, and more. CLn, Facial Moisturizer — $35.00\nThe CLn Facial Moisturizer combines\nniacinamide and ceramides to soothe and calm skin, help reduce the appearance of redness, and lock in moisture—all without clogging pores. It’s recommended to anyone dealing with redness, drying, flaking, eczema, acne, and/or rosacea. Abby Rose, Soothe-X Face & Body Oil — $18.00\nFinding an oil that works for eczema-prone skin can be tricky because many include potentially irritating essential oils. The Abby Rose Soothe-X Face & Body Oil is a fragrance-free combination of sunflower seed oil, coconut oil, hemp seed oil, jojoba seed oil, ballon plant, calendula flowers, and vitamin E oil. It works best when rubbed into damp skin.\nPacifica, Vegan Ceramide Barrier Cream — $18.00\nFormulated with vegan ceramides, amino acids, niacinamide, and shea butter, the Pacifica Beauty Vegan Ceramide Barrier Cream melts into your skin cream to hydrate and help restore your skin’s protective barrier.\nCeraVe, SPF 50 Sunscreen Face Lotion — $15.00\nThe CeraVe SPF 50 Sunscreen Face Lotion uses zinc oxide and titanium oxide to reflect harmful UVA and UVB rays from the skin. While chemical sun blockers can be irritating to those with sensitive skin, this formula uses minerals so it’s safe for sensitive skin. It’s also made with niacinamide and three essential ceramides to help restore the skin’s natural barrier and lock in moisture.\nAvène, XeraCalm A.D Lipid-Replenishing Cream — $36.00\nThe Avène XeraCalm A.D Lipid-Replenishing Cream nourishes, soothes, and calms dry, itchy skin that’s prone to atopic dermatitis and eczema. It works by helping to rebalance the skin’s microbiome while supporting the skin’s defense system.\nEczema Honey, Original Skin Soothing Cream — $30.00\nThe Eczema Honey Original Skin Soothing Cream contains1 percent colloidal oatmeal, organic honey, beeswax, almond and organic sunflower oils, and organic aloe vera juice to soothe, moisturize, hydrate, and protect the skin. You can use it on the face and the body. Bonus: Use it with a cotton pad to remove makeup or as a lip balm\nZo Skin Health, Hydrating Crème — $120.00\nThe Zo Skin Health Hydrating Crème uses ophiopogon japonicus root extract, peptides, antioxidants, and colloidal oatmeal to temporarily relieve symptoms of severely dry skin while calming irritation and replenishing the skin’s natural moisture.\nAvène, Soothing Eye Contour Cream — $32.00\nThe Avène Soothing Eye Contour Cream smooths, moisturizes, and relieves redness, irritation, tightness, and puffiness with thermal spring water, dextran sulfate, antioxidants, and vitamin E.\nLa Roche-Posay, Lipikar Eczema Soothing Relief Cream — $16.00\nLa Roche-Posay Lipikar Eczema Soothing Relief Cream uses glycerin and shea butter to replenish skin’s essential lipids while providing instant, lasting hydration. It can be used both on the face and body.\nSkinfix, Eczema+ Dermatitis Relief Balm — $45.00\nThe Skinfix Eczema+ Dermatitis Relief Balm soothes facial\ndermatitis, eczema, and dry skin patches, leaving behind soothed and protected skin.\nLearn about the top five ingredients a dermatologist recommends for dry skin:\nFace Oils, Moisturizer, Skin-Care Tips, Well+Good SHOP\nLoading More Posts...",
