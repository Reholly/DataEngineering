    "text": "BANKS COUNTY, Ga. — In the Banks County High School auditorium, about two dozen students showed up to the first day of forensic science class on Friday morning. For Senior Emma Williams, she was \"so excited.\" \"I was like, 'all my podcasts—I’m going to finally be that girl,\" Williams said with a smile when she learned a medical examiner with the [Georgia Bureau of Investigation](https://gbi.georgia.gov/) would be leading the first class. Williams said while science or math isn't her strength, it's a class she worked to get into. \"And I’m really interested in this,\" Williams described. \"There are only two girls in my forensic science class. I think it's really important that I do want to pursue this.\" Dr. Rachel Geller, an associate medical examiner with the GBI, spoke with the students as she explained what a medical examiner is, what they do, and why they're so needed. \"I think the most important thing we can do to address the critical shortage of forensic pathologists in the United States is support younger people and mentor the youth,\" Geller said. \"We have such small numbers of people going into this field and completing all of the training, and yet, we have so many positions unfilled, and we really need forensic pathologists to serve the community,\" she added. Across the country, Geller said only about 50 forensic pathologists graduated in 2023, adding it's the main reason for the nationwide shortage. It's one reason the GBI decided to recruit more people by going into high schools in hopes of encouraging more students to pursue a career in forensic science. \"I see 20 forensic pathologists,\" Geller laughed when talking about the class. \"I was delighted to see all of these young people who are excited about forensic science because we have so many openings at the GBI.\" Currently, the GBI needs toxicologists, fingerprint examiners, forensic scientists, and more. Geller said the need not only impacts the backlog but also the families that are waiting for closure. The ability to bring families some peace is what Geller called \"the greatest privilege\" of being a medical examiner. She added another privilege, was getting to speak with and encourage students like Williams. \"All of them that came up were women,\" said Williams of the three GBI doctors in attendance. \"That was really exciting, and that was really encouraging. 'Okay, I can do this, and I can be someone important in this field.'\" Geller said she knows it's a long road for the students that want to become medical examiners, with years of school needed. But she said the journey is worth it.",
