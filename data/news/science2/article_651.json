I never used it for state as I have just done them by hand with PDFs from the state.\n[Re: Freetaxusa vs Turbotax](./viewtopic.php?p=7636758&sid=68d455e72c781547fae9fed3d131ec87#p7636758)\n[Re: Freetaxusa vs Turbotax](./viewtopic.php?p=7636807&sid=68d455e72c781547fae9fed3d131ec87#p7636807)\nYou probably looked at this page:\n[tetractys]wrote: [↑]Fri Jan 05, 2024 5:00 pmSomewhere along the line I thought I saw a list of features with prices. I can’t find it now though, and 1099 forms are free, so maybe I was mistaken. https://www.freetaxusa.com/pricingand saw that \"investments\" where listed under a \"Premium Features\" section and assumed you needed to pay extra for that.
