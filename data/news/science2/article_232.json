    "text": "The number of technical innovators and inventors is increasing every year among the employees of the Pyongyang Kim Jong Suk Silk Mill.\nPeople ask employees about the secret of their contribution to the production by solving tens of technical problems.\nThe employees unanimously say that anyone, if he or she is determined, can be technical innovators and inventors in our country which provides all conditions for learning.\nThe employees of the mill regularly use the sci-tech learning space to acquire scientific and technological knowledge suited to their occupations.\nMany of them are involved in the distance education system. The number of graduates is on the increase every year and a lot of technical innovators and inventors are produced among them.\nThey include many women employees.\nEven those with babies freely work and learn as the mill has a nursery with good nursing conditions.\nThe other day, a woman worker was told that her baby was ill. She hurriedly charged a colleague with her work and rushed to the nursery of the mill. But she returned soon, because the nurses had already taken necessary measures. She came back to her work place without worry and carried out her daily assignment. Some time later, she made an invention conducive to improving the quality of product.\nFully provided with all conditions, she and many other women employees work freely while bringing up their children and learn to their hearts' content while working to be praised as treasures of the mill.",
