    "text": "The blockchain-based virtual world The Sandbox announced several new initiatives this week aimed at increasing user engagement in 2024.\nOn January 4th, The Sandbox\nlaunched a new “Game Jam” competition in partnership with Dr. Bomkus. The event has a prize pool of 100,000 SAND tokens and other rewards like LAND, Catalysts, and publishing opportunities. The platform also recently collaborated with other games to provide giveaways and rewards.\nIn addition, The Sandbox unveiled a “Season’s Greetings” reward pool on January 4th containing 600,000 SAND tokens. 100,000 tokens are open to all users, while 200,000 are exclusively for Avatar owners. 300,000 tokens are reserved as rewards for LAND NFT holders.\nThe company also\nintroduced a new X handle, “The Sandbox SEA,” for its South East Asia user base. This regional focus comes amid increased regulatory attention on The Sandbox in the US after the SEC labeled SAND an unregistered security last year.\nFurthermore, The Sandbox continues working to expand its ecosystem, and recently\nreleasing version 0.9 of its Game Maker platform to empower users to more easily create experiences. It also launched a 100 million SAND Game Maker fund.\nThe announcements helped boost community engagement, though SAND’s price remains depressed after the January 3rd crypto market flash crash.\nThe token currently trades around $0.50.\nAlso read:\n[Ottawa Police Caution Residents About Cryptocurrency Job Scam]",
