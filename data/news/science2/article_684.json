    "text": "Citi Double Cash Card Limited Time Offer\nTable of Contents\nCiti Double Cash Card Limited Time signup bonus\nFor a limited time only you’ll earn $200 cash back in the form of 20,000 ThankYou points for spending $1,500 in 6 months on a new\n Citi Double Cash Card.\nThis card rarely offers any signup bonus, making this a great offer for an incredible card! It’s also the highest signup bonus for this card to date.\nCiti Double Cash Card annual fee\n$0.\nCiti Double Cash Card signup bonus rules\nPoints are not available if you have received a new account bonus for a Citi Double Cash account in the past 48 months.\nCiti allows applications for 1 card every 8 days and 2 cards every 2 months. You can check application status at 866-252-0118 and you can call reconsideration if you’re denied at 800-695-5171.\nCiti Double Cash Card earnings\nThis card earns 2% cash back everywhere, in the form of 2 ThankYou points per dollar spent.\nThat is an excellent earn rate for a flexible currency that lets you have the best of both worlds, cash or points on demand as you want it.\nYou can redeem those points for 2% cash back with no minimum required to cash out, or you can transfer them into miles if you have a\n Citi Premier card.\nCiti also often offers discounted gift cards with ThankYou points, which can offer even more value.\nIf you also have a\nCiti Rewards+ you’ll get also a 10% rebate, up to 10,000 points rebated per year, when you redeem points!\nYou can also earn 5% cash back in the form of 5 ThankYou points per dollar on hotels, car rentals and attractions booked on the Citi Travel portal through 12/31/24.\nCiti Double Cash Card zero APR on balance transfers\n- Get 0% intro APR on balance transfers for 18 months from date of the first transfer.\n- Balance transfers need to be completed in the first 4 months of account opening.\n- There is a balance transfer fee of $5 or 3% of the amount of the transfer, whichever is greater.\nCiti Double Cash Card Non-expiring points\nYour Citi ThankYou points will not expire for as long as you remain a cardholder. If you transfer points to another member points will expire in 90 days.\nCiti Double Cash Card Virtual card numbers\nWith a virtual card number you can set a dollar limit and/or expiration date to generate a one-time use credit card number so that you don’t keep getting charged for subscriptions or have your real card number stolen, among myriad other potential uses.\nCiti Double Cash Card points transfers and card conversions\nYou can transfer Citi points to anyone, but once you transfer points they will expire in 90 days, so only do that if you’re ready to transfer them into airline miles or redeem them another way within that timeframe. You can share 100K points per calendar year and you can receive 100K points per calendar year.\nYou can convert any Citi card into another Citi card. For example, even if you have a Double Cash card, you can get approved for another one and then convert it to a card like\nCiti Custom Cash Card which you can’t get approved for if you already have one, but you can get multiple of via product changes.\nCiti Bifecta, Trifecta, Or Quadfecta\nCiti has 3 excellent cards that pair perfectly with a\nCiti Double Cash Card.

This is marketed as 5% cash back, but will actually come in the form of 5 ThankYou points per dollar spent! Eligible categories include Restaurants, Gas Stations, Grocery Stores, Select Travel, Select Transit, Select Streaming Services, Drugstores, Home Improvement Stores, Fitness Clubs, and Live Entertainment. You will also get 0% APR on purchases and balance transfers for 15 months.\nThe\nCiti Rewards+ Card automatically rounds up rewards earned on every purchase to the nearest 10 points, meaning you will earn 10 points on a $0.50 Amazon balance reload, which is equal to earning 20 points per dollar spent! You will also get 0% APR on purchases and balance transfers for 15 months.\nHaving a\nCiti Rewards+ Card also gets you a 10% points rebate when you redeem points, up to a 10K points rebate per year. While the Rewards+ card doesn’t transfer points into most airline miles, if you have a Citi Premier card and a Rewards+ card you’ll even get a 10% rebate on mileage transfers!\nThe\nCiti Premier Card allows you to transfer all of your ThankYou points into miles with many valuable programs. It earns 3 points per dollar on airfare, hotels, travel agents, groceries, gas, and dining.\nA Citi Bifecta would consist of a household that has the\nCiti Premier and the Citi Double Cash or https://www.dansdeals.com/go/RewardsPlusQS1/.

That means you’ll effectively earn 11.1 points on small purchases and 3.33 points per dollar on airfare, hotels, travel agents, groceries, gas, and dining or 5.55 points per dollar on restaurants for your first year. If both members in a household have a Citi Premier and Citi Rewards+ then both members can each get the 10% rebate on up to 100,000 of points redeemed per year.\nA Citi Trifecta would consist of a household that has the\nCiti Premier, the Citi Double Cash, and the https://www.dansdeals.com/go/RewardsPlusQS1/.

Ask the agent if your card number will remain the same so that you will still be eligible for more signup bonuses.\nPoint transfer options with Citi Premier\nIf you also have a\nCiti Premier card, you can transfer points into miles.
