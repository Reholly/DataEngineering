    "text": "An exhibition showing clouds portrayed in both art and photographic form is currently happening in Zürich, Switzerland, running until March 10, 2024.\nA collaboration between the Image Archive and the Graphic Collection of ETH Zürich, the exhibition covers different printmaking techniques involved in cloud imagery, as well as asking philosophical questions about the very nature of capturing images of clouds. As the official press release says, ‘Constant movement and ever-changing form are of the essence of clouds. Their mobility and variety make them impossible to pin down – yet, by the same token, clouds can be anything: from the sublime embodiment of longing and an ominous portent, to the dwelling of the gods, to a mere accumulation of condensed water. But if the essence of clouds consists in their perpetual motion and formal metamorphosis, how can they be captured in an image?’\nYou can find out more about this exhibition by visiting the\nETH Zürich’s website.\nThe exhibition is being held at:\nETH Zurich\nGraphische Sammlung\nHG E 52\nRämistrasse 101\n8092 Zurich\nSwitzerland\n+41 44 632 40 46\nImage: © ETH Library, Image Archive",
