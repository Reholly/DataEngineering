In a world where exploring the great outdoors has become a way of life, these two products have garnered attention for their exceptional design, functionality and versatility.\nWhat distinguishes this WKND Warrior combo is its seamless compatibility, as the awning and rooftop tent are expertly designed to work together. Using the WKND 316 stainless steel brackets allows the awning to securely attach to the side of the rooftop tent.\nAdditionally, standard installation options are available for securely mounting the awning to your vehicle's roof rack. There is flexibility when it comes to mounting the rooftop tent, with the choice to mount it directly on to a platform rack, crossbars or canopy.\n13 “ The Warrior 270 Awning and Odin rooftop tent are a dynamic duo , a perfect pairing that turns any camping trip into a well-coordinated outdoor masterpiece. Together, they redefine comfort and convenience in the wilderness,” said Kaedon Thiart, owner of WKND Warriors.\nThe rooftop Tent boasts a sleek and slim design, standing at only 170mm in height (excluding roof racks and solar panels), it is one of the slimmest rooftop tents available. Using robust 280gsm rip-stop polyester-cotton material with double-stitching and waterproofing, you're shielded from the elements, ensuring no seepage or mildew, even on rainy nights.\nThe tent comes equipped with anti-condensation mats at both the top and bottom, along with three access zippers to perfectly accommodate any touring setup. All of these features are encased in a durable honeycomb aluminium hard shell, providing excellent insulation against varying weather conditions.\nGear Guides Suspension Lights Canopies Bullbars Roof Racks Recovery Gear Storage Tools Camping Tents & Awnings 13 Other features include internal USB/USB-C charging points, six roof storage pockets, a 12V red/white LED strip light, and a 70mm high-density foam mattress. Weighing 65kg, this certainly is a lightweight rooftop tent. The internal sleeping space is 2050mm x 1220mm and the closed dimensions are 2100mm x 1340mm x 170mm, not taking into account the included 125W ultra-thin hard solar panel.\nThe awning is self-standing, with the externally braced design offering an advantage in maximising your usable shade compared to other 270-degree self-standing awnings. It includes a fold-up pole and features extended final arms and improved rear coverage. Made using the same polycotton as the RTT, the awning is lightweight with functional bracing designed to withstand high winds.\nThe Warrior 270 awning and WKND Odin rooftop tent combo offers an unbeatable combination of quality, functionality and convenience for only $5500.
