    "text": "In the latest market close, Intuit (INTU) reached $589.02, with a +0.37% movement compared to the previous day. The stock outperformed the S&P 500, which registered a daily gain of 0.18%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.07%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.1%.\nThe maker of TurboTax, QuickBooks and other accounting software's shares have seen an increase of 2.68% over the last month, surpassing the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 1.84% and falling behind the S&P 500's gain of 2.75%.\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Intuit in its upcoming release. In that report, analysts expect Intuit to post earnings of $2.29 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 4.09%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $3.39 billion, up 11.36% from the year-ago period.\nIn terms of the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates predict earnings of $16.38 per share and a revenue of $16.04 billion, indicating changes of +13.75% and +11.63%, respectively, from the former year.\nInvestors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for Intuit. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 0.06% fall in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. Intuit presently features a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\nFrom a valuation perspective, Intuit is currently exchanging hands at a Forward P/E ratio of 35.83. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 30.65, so one might conclude that Intuit is trading at a premium comparatively.\nIt is also worth noting that INTU currently has a PEG ratio of 2.43. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. As the market closed yesterday, the Computer - Software industry was having an average PEG ratio of 2.28.\nThe Computer - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 166, which puts it in the bottom 35% of all 250+ industries.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank evaluates the power of our distinct industry groups by determining the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks forming the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nRemember to apply Zacks.com to follow these and more stock-moving metrics during the upcoming trading sessions.\nOnly $1 to See All Zacks' Buys and Sells\nWe're not kidding.\nSeveral years ago, we shocked our members by offering them 30-day access to all our picks for the total sum of only $1.
