    "text": "TLDR - There is renewed optimism amongst Bitcoin bulls as its price soared to a 21-month high following the recent positive developments around the asset. - Investors have found NuggetRush, a new meme coin, to be the next big thing for profits this quarter. - NuggetRush’s presale will complete its fourth round in about 19 days, with a price uptick of 20% for the next round. Last year saw a series of benchmarks surpassed in Bitcoin’s (BTC) network and on-chain activities. On the cusp of the new year, BTC has already recorded a massive liquidation of Bitcoin shorts, a notable daily increase in transaction confirmations, and its DeFi coin price skyrocketed above $45,000. These developments, amongst others, emphasize that the crypto bulls are back up and active as 2024 commences. Drawing parallels to BTC’s uptrend, [NuggetRush (NUGX)](https://nuggetrush.io/?utm_source=PR&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=bit&utm_content=133) [ i](https://nuggetrush.io/?utm_source=PR&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=bit&utm_content=133)s a relatively new cryptocurrency initial coin offering (ICO) in the meme coin sector, turning heads this year’s first quarter. As NuggetRush intertwines blockchain gaming with real-time earnings, it appeals to newbies and pro-investors seeking a top ICO venture with tangible utility and profitability potential. This article will explain why NuggetRush is a coining token for gains this quarter. NuggetRush (NUGX) Brings A New Dimension Of Play-to-Earn (P2E) Gaming [NuggetRush](https://nuggetrush.io/?utm_source=PR&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=bit&utm_content=133) offers a platform where cryptocurrency investing, P2E gaming, earning, and social impact all interlink. It forms the foundation of a revolutionary blockchain game akin to real-world artisanal mining while actively making a worthwhile difference in the lives of artisanal miners in underdeveloped countries. Also, every digitally mined gold nugget in the game is linked to tangible rewards like gold and cash in real-time. NuggetRush features a no-tax and zero-fee model, ensuring that users can engage with the project without the burden of extra fees. Also, the platform provides an enticing array of giveaways to active participants worth $150,000 in total. All the rewarding avenues of NuggetRush boost user engagement and drive its rapid ascent on the decentralized cryptocurrency list, as it offers many benefits that exceed speculative trading. The ongoing presale has seen the sale of over 130 million NUGX tokens in four rounds, amassing over $1.5 million in funding. At the end of the presale, investors can claim up to 50% of the tokens in five claim rounds, according to their entry time. NuggetRush also provides another avenue for earning through its staking mechanism, where non-fungible token (NFT) holders can earn up to a 20% annual percentage yield (APY). NUGX currently sits at a DeFi coin price of $0.015 and has about 9.5 million tokens left before the price increases to $0.018 in the last round. The well-outlined roadmap and goals of the project are also propelling NuggetRush towards its proposed $100 million market cap milestone. This top ICO promises good gains and growth as an enticing pick to venture into in January 2024. Bitcoin (BTC) Clears The $45,000 Resistance Level. Bitcoin has cleared its previous resistance level and reached an intrayear high of $45,870, as shown in CoinGecko data. The big move pushed the world’s largest digital asset to its highest level since March 2022, and BTC is now just 34% down from its peak price of $69,000 in November 2021. The surge can be attributed to the spot Bitcoin ETF (exchange-traded fund) approval hype. Bitcoin investors are kickstarting the year well, as seen in the recent rise in transactional activities. The Bitcoin network recently eclipsed yet another record by verifying 731,351 daily transactions. Additionally, a massive liquidation of Bitcoin shorts, amounting to over $115 million, happened on January 1. BTC‘s ongoing strong performance could indicate a broader market upturn, as it is a bellwether for other digital assets. Conclusion There is an uptick in Bitcoin’s price action this new year as optimism around BTC ETF approval continues to gather momentum. On the other hand, the decentralized cryptocurrency list features a coining token, NuggetRush, that fosters an empowered gaming community and offers perks like tangible utility, no extra costs, and multiple earning opportunities. As evidenced by numbers, its presale has maintained a bullish trend, with participants bulk-buying the tokens for gains. Interested investors can purchase NUGX from the website now that it costs less this quarter.",
