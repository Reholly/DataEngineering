    "text": "EINPresswire.com/ -- Jean A. of Elmont, NY is the creator of the Consuming Fire, a fire dampening tool capable of putting out fires in a home, vehicles, and more. The system features a box on the ceiling or mounted underneath a vehicle’s hood designed to dispense wet combined-chemical suppressant to completely eradicate a fire. The device includes a smoke and heat sensor configured to detect raised temperatures and excessive levels of smoke, triggering the system to dispense the extinguishing chemicals.\nThe market for fire dampening devices and fire suppression systems has traditionally been driven by factors like increased awareness of fire safety, stringent regulations, and the growing need for protecting lives and property. Innovations in fire suppression technologies can influence market dynamics. Companies that develop more efficient, environmentally friendly, and cost-effective solutions, like the Consuming Fire product, may gain a competitive edge.\nJean was issued their Utility Patent from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and is working closely with\nInventionHome, a leading invention licensing firm, to sell or license the patent rights to their Consuming Fire product. Ideal licensing candidates would be U.S. based product manufacturers or distributors looking to further develop and distribute this product innovation.\nCompanies interested in the Consuming Fire can contact InventionHome at\n[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).
