    "text": "Get The Best Alternative To Metal Braces In Barbados: Invisalign Treatment\n[Dr. Golding's Dental Office](/dr-goldings-dental-office/) - Friday, January 5, 2024.\nAlternative To Traditional Orthodontic Treatments: Invisalign\nWhat if food gets stuck in your metal braces? What if people notice them when I smile? Ah, the age-old dental dilemmas. These are some of the common thoughts that probably crossed your mind when you considered getting your teeth straightened.\nWell, good thing these concerns are now a thing of the past! Just opt for Invisalign instead. Dr. Golding's Dental Office in Barbados is here to introduce you to a new and improved way to straighten your teeth - clear plastic aligners!\nGo to\nhttps://www.drgoldingdental.com/ for more on all the latest dental treatments offered at Dr. Golding's!\nBefore treatment, you will have a consultation to determine the right treatment option for you. Though the entire duration of the Invisalign treatment will vary on a case-to-case basis, it generally produces effective results in about 9 months.\nDr. Golding’s dental office uses proprietary software to perform scans and fit you for Invisalign. Based on these scans, a series of clear aligners will be custom-designed for you.\nWhy Choose Invisalign?\n- Removable\nInvisalign is a great option for those who aren't keen on fixed aligners to correct their misaligned teeth. As Invisalign clear aligners can be removed as and when required, they make eating and cleaning your teeth a whole lot easier.\n- Discreet\nIn contrast to metal braces, these aligners don't attract too much attention to your teeth. As these are made with clear plastic, you can smile without a care in the world. Pictures? Yes, please!\n- Comfortable\nDiscomfort? None of that. Since these series of clear aligners are customised to fit your mouth and set of teeth perfectly, they are more comfortable and cause less chafing and irritation.\nDr. Golding's Specialisations\nWith over 40 years in clinical practice, Dr. Derek Golding utilizes a skillful approach combined with the latest technology to ensure a gentle and painless treatment. Dr. Golding has made cutting-edge developments in oral health and has a wealth of experience in treating both children and adults.\nAlong with orthodontics, the dental office also provides prosthodontic (repair/replacement of teeth with dental prosthetics) treatments and other services, which include:\n- Dentures\n- Crowns\n- Bridges\n- Implants\n- Veneers\n- Cosmetic Surgery\n- Oral-maxillofacial Surgery\n- Laser Dentistry\n- Gap Closures\n- Teeth Whitening\n- Smile Makeovers\nA client of Dr Golding's shared: “I have just finished my Invisalign treatment at Dr. Golding's office. My teeth were straightened within a year and the process was seamless and virtually painless. Dr. Golding has a very warm, pleasant demeanour and explained every step of the way as we tracked my progress and was always willing to answer any questions I had.”\nVisit\nhttps://www.drgoldingdental.com/breathhealer/2019/2/15/invisalign to book your consultation or to learn more about Dr. Golding's other dental services.\nDr. Golding's Dental Office\n#5 Stafford House Garrison Road The Garrison\nBridgetown\nhttps://www.drgoldingdental.com/\nAbout Dr. Golding's Dental Office\nContact info\nCompany: Dr. Golding's Dental Office Address: #5 Stafford House Garrison Road The Garrison, Bridgetown, Saint Michael BB14038, Barbados Email: prc.pressagency@gmail.com Phone: +1-246-228-2201 Website: https://www.drgoldingdental.com/\n[More about Dr. Golding's Dental Office](/dr-goldings-dental-office/)\nContact info\nDr Derek Golding Dr. Golding's Dental Office #5 Stafford House Garrison Road The Garrison Bridgetown https://www.drgoldingdental.com/ dgolding@caribsurf.com",
