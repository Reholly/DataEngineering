    "text": "Three baby sisters have smashed odds of 200 million to one after being born as genetically identical triplets .\nLittle Willow, Nancie and Mabel Davies will grow up as the spitting images of each other, scientists say. Proud parents Louise and Gareth Davies decided to carry out genetic testing on the triplets after being intrigued by their similar faces. And experts found the eight-week-old girls are super-rare identical sisters after examining their matching genes .\nLouise said: “We are over the moon with the results. We couldn’t be happier to know that the girls are all identical.”\nThe couple from Huddersfield, West Yorks, found they were expecting triplets after a scan 12 weeks into Louise’s pregnancy . The tots arrived on November 10 last year at 34 weeks. Willow was 4lb 8oz, Nancie was 5lb and Mabel tipped the scales at 4lb 11oz.\nGenetics lab NorthGene, in Deeside, North Wales, confirmed the couple’s suspicions. Their scientists said the chances of all three triplets being identical are 200 million to one, yet this is their third case in three years.\nTeam leader Charlotte Haskayne said: “Knowing we have made a difference in people’s lives is the reason why we do what we do.” Shauna Leven, chief executive of Twins Trust which supports families of multiple births, said: “It’s so important to allow them to establish themselves as individuals. This includes everything from dressing them differently to spending dedicated time with each child. It also means thinking carefully about their individual educational needs when they start school. We wish them well.”",
