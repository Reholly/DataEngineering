    "text": "With over a decade of experience in the world of cannabis science, Delta Munchies makes it clear that they go above and beyond to ensure their products are as pure, safe, and high-quality as possible. No matter what product you choose, Delta Munchies only uses the safest cannabis extract and ingredients; and, of course, they have all the COAs to prove it.\nThe only thing they don’t have to prove? Their extraction techniques. This information isn’t available at all on their website; when I reached out about it, they responded and said that they “source their oil from a 3rd party accredited laboratory.” So, take that as you will.\nAlong with being honest and transparent, Delta Munchies produces some of the tastiest, hardest-hitting Delta-8 and HHC products in the industry. Their edibles are incredibly delicious and offer nostalgic tastes like Peach Rings; while their carts hit smooth and have full terpene profiles that your mouth and nose will love.\nThe edibles took a little long to kick in, but the results made it worth the wait. If you need immediate, potent results, the carts are easily the best choice — especially for pain relief.\nTechnical Details\n|Availability:||Nationwide|\n|Price:||$$|\n|Potencies:||300-3000mg|\n|Strength:||Medium-Heavy|\n|THC Content:||<0.3%|\n|Cannabinoids:||Delta-8, Delta-9, HHC|\n|Product Types:||Gummies, Vapes, Tincture, Flower|\n|Hemp Origin:||USA|\n|Third-Party Testing:|Hometown Hero, 3Chi, Spyglass, Delta Extrax\nEditor’s Pick\n- The kid in me was immediately drawn to\nthe Sour Apple flavor of Delta Munchies’ delta-8 THC tincture. I love to use tinctures throughout the day because of their potency and accessibility, but I’m often turned off by the taste and texture. However, I couldn’t believe how delicious their Sour Apple Tincture was. Not only did it contain 1,000 mg of D8 (perfect for my experienced self), but the flavor was incredibly appealing and didn’t leave any weird taste in my mouth. After just 15 minutes, my body was already starting to relax. This is perfect for anyone who enjoys the ease of tinctures but needs a break from the traditional herbaceous flavors.\nHHC Cartridge: Alien OG\nHHC carts are quickly becoming some of my favorite cannabis products — and Delta Munchies’ Alien OG HHC cart is no exception. This cartridge was hard-hitting yet smooth, producing potent effects in a pleasant, not overwhelming way.\nRight off the bat, the pine yet citrus-like flavors were obvious, and my mouth loved them. Then, immediately, it was clear that the HHC was working: my body pain quickly began to fade and I was in a much happier, more relaxed state than before. This strain was ideal for unwinding at the end of a long day. My only confusion is that the box was labeled as an indica, when this strain is definitely a hybrid.\nHighlights\nDelta Munchies’ Alien OG HHC vape cartridge works well, tastes great, and has incredible potency that you’ll feel from head to toe. The cartridge itself is made fine — it’s nothing special but also doesn’t look or feel cheap. The packaging also makes it clear exactly what you’re smoking. At 1,000 mg, the HHC was beautifully potent and I loved the relaxing effects it brought to me immediately.\nEffects Felt During Testing\n- Effects: Relaxed, happy, comfortable\n- Good For: Promoting relaxation, reducing pain, enhancing comfort, boosting mood\n- Not Good For: Morning use\nDelta 8 Cartridge: Dutch Treat\nIf you’re looking for a tasty, uplifting strain to puff on throughout the day, Delta Munchies delta-8 cartridge in the Dutch Treat strain is the right choice. This sativa-dominant strain is ideal for enhancing motivation and uplifting the mood, giving you the perfect midday pick-me-up.\nCompared to the HHC cart, this one produced slightly milder effects. I didn’t mind too much, but it did make me prefer their HHC products overall. These effects were more subdued, in general, so I did take a few more hits than with the other cart.\nHighlights\nThe delta-8 Dutch Treat cart from Delta Munchies is tasty, packaged well, and produces subtle uplifting effects. While the potency wasn’t quite as strong as their HHC cartridges, I was still happy with the stimulating effects I got. (I just needed a few more hits to get there.) The cartridge emitted delicious flavors and aromas, as well. My only complaint was the lack of potency compared to their HHC products.\nEffects Felt During Testing\n- Effects: Happy, comfortable, productive\n- Good For: Boosting mood, enhancing energy, creating motivation\n- Not Good For: Bedtime consumption, those with high tolerances\nDelta 8 Gummies: Sour Worms\nFrom the packaging to the potency and everything in between, I sure loved Delta Munchies D8 Sour Worms. These delta-8 infused sour gummy worms had incredible flavors and natural textures that reminded me of my favorite movie theater candy.\nUnfortunately, I found myself waiting about 90 minutes for the first results of the gummies to kick in; but, when they did, I was a happy camper. My body felt more at ease, but I wasn’t glued to the couch, either. I felt positive and like I could tackle everything on my to-do list. At 25 mg per gummy, I found one dose ideal for all day long. Delta Munchies offers these gummies in two options: 25 pieces at 625 mg, or 40 pieces at 1,000 mg. The choice is yours.\nHighlights\nYou’ll fall in love with Delta Munchies delta-8 Sour Worms the moment you see them. The brand uses great packaging and even better ingredients to craft these tasty treats. You have to be patient though: these gummies took quite a while to kick in for me. Regardless, once they did, I was incredibly happy with the overall result: I felt supported, motivated, blissful, and comfortable. What more can you ask for?\nEffects Felt During Testing\n- Effects: Happy, motivated, blissful, comfortable\n- Good For: Promoting positivity, enhancing mood, pain relief\n- Not Good For: Nighttime consumption\nDelta 9 Gummies: Blue Dream\nPotent, 100% vegan and carefully crafted, these Delta 9 Blue Dream gummies supplied by Delta Munchies offer a top quality dreamy, high – no pun intended. Not only is the look and design of the package electric and practical to maintain freshness, but the potency stands out in each gummy. It did not take me much time to realize these gummies would be my new go-to for on-the-go D9 microdosing.\nThese gummies are offered in a few different flavors and potencies; choose from a very berry Blue Dream, a delectable Strawberry Shortcake, or fruit bursting Mango Crush. No matter which one you decide to dose, you have the option of choosing between 25 pieces at 250 mg or a whopping 40 pieces at 400 mg per jar. If you’re a real THC lover in search of a deliciously dank and discreet edible, you might opt for the latter.\nHighlights\nThese Delta-9 gummies from Delta Munchies are ideal for those who are looking for a convenient and tasty treat that will bring a sense of relaxation and ease. Additionally, they are a great option for anyone interested in full-spectrum blends. Not only is Delta Munchies D9 gummies created with the highest quality cannabis extracts, but the poppy packaging is eye-catching and provides optimal freshness to maintain the quality of each and every gummy.\nWe just wish the containers were colored darker, so be sure to keep these away from direct sunlight to avoid losing potency. Nonetheless, with a simple bite, you’ll experience an uplifting effect — these are definitely a new favorite!\nEffects Felt During Testing\n- Effects: Euphoric, serene, bubbly\n- Good For: Promoting happy feelings, microdosing for a mood boost\n- Not Good For: Pain relief or inflammation\nTHC-A Diamond-Infused Pre-Rolls\nIf you’re looking for a new type of cannabis experience, Delta Munchies has the perfect products for you: THC-A diamond-infused pre-rolls. These pre-rolls are filled with premium hemp flower, rolled in kief, and then glazed with liquid THC-A diamonds. Trust us when we say that these are some of the prettiest pre-rolls you’ll get your hands on in a while. They’re available in three mouth-watering flavors: Berry Marmalade, Peach Cobbler, and Champagne Slushie. Each pack has two of these infused pre-rolls, and Delta Munchies sells them for $29.99 a piece.\nHighlights\nThe THC-A diamond-infused pre-rolls from Delta Munchies are potent, flavorful, and incredibly relaxing. Most consumers find these pre-rolls ideal at the end of the day, as they’re best for reducing stress, anxiety, and pain (all while getting you pretty high, too). While the photos of the pre-rolls were beautiful, they don’t always show up that nicely when ordered, simply because of the packaging and the elements of the pre-roll itself. However, I was very happy to see that Delta Munchies offers comprehensive full-panel COAs for these products, despite only coming out a few months back.\nEffects Felt During Testing\n- Effects: Relaxed, sleepy, euphoric\n- Good For: Reducing pain, lowering anxiety, boosting mood\n- Not Good For: Daytime consumption\nDelta-8 Rainbow Sour Belts\nThe delta-8 Rainbow Sour Belts from Delta Munchies are a limited edition item, best for only the most experienced consumers. The entire bag contains 3,000 mg of delta-8 THC, with each rainbow belt containing a whopping 300 mg. These gummies are incredibly potent and the brand strongly suggests not consuming one all at once; instead, it’s best to start with just a tenth of the belt and go from there. Delta Munchies’ powerful Rainbow Belts are available now for $59.99.\nHighlights\nIf you’re someone with a high cannabis tolerance looking to enjoy a powerful yet tasty edible, Delta Munchies’ D8 Rainbow Belts are the way to go. These rainbow belts are incredibly satisfying to eat, reminding you of your typical rainbow belt candy when it comes to flavor. After about an hour, the strong effects of the delta-8 THC start to kick in, providing strong full-body relaxation (and some of the best sleep of your life). However, with these powerful gummies, you have to make sure you only consume a small amount of the rainbow belt; otherwise, you’re sure to be way too stoned.\nEffects Felt During Testing\n- Effects: Euphoric, tranquil, comfortable, sleepy\n- Good For: Helping with sleep, promoting full-body relaxation, blissful effects\n- Not Good For: Morning consumption, energy\nFull-Spectrum Delta-9 Holy Ropes\nThe Full-Spectrum Delta-9 Holy Rope from Delta Munchies is one that will take you right back to your childhood. This product is essentially an infused Nerd’s rope that has an impressive 1,250 mg per rope. With the full-spectrum blend, the Holy Rope boasts delta-9 THC, HHC, CBG, CBD, and CBN all in one. Unfortunately, if you’re looking for this product on Delta Munchies’ website, you won’t find it: it’s currently only available for wholesale purchases.\nHighlights\nDelta Munchies’ Delta-9 Holy Ropes not only taste amazing, but they provide a well-rounded, powerful experience that’s both psychoactive and very supportive. The full-spectrum blend offers blissful, mood-enhancing effects while also helping with things like discomfort, stress, and anxiety.\nEffects Felt During Testing\n- Effects: Blissful, stimulated, talkative, comfortable\n- Good For: Group sessions, feeling social, boosting mood, enhancing stimulation\n- Not Good For: Helping with sleep, night time consumption\nDelta-9 Fruit Jam Gummies\nAhhh, finally some gummies that not only look good, but taste and feel good – Delta Munchies is all in when it comes to their 100% vegan delta-9 gummies and it really shows! If it’s appetizing flavor and being smoothly baked that you crave, look to this brand to get the job done. While the selection isn’t that extensive, we appreciate a brand that has strived to offer quality in terms of tastes, spectrum of effects and cannabinoid profile – a real stoner’s obsession.\nHighlights\nThese Froot Jam gummies were made with a beautiful full-spectrum blend of hemp-derived delta-9 THC, HHC, CBD, CBN, CBG, and natural terpenes to enhance the effects of D9. Some include Strawberry Dream, Tropical Passion and Appleberry Nectar. Aside from its aesthetically pleasing design, perhaps the best part about these gummies is that they look and taste just like a flavor-bursting Gusher — but expect to take cerebral flight hours, especially with their juicy Strawberry Dream eddies. If you think the strength of these psychoactive gummies is too good to be true, put them to the test and check their COAs on their website for potency levels. The only downsides are, the onset is pretty slow, it’s pretty hard to open and close packaging and also, we really wish we knew if these were tested for pesticides.\nEffects Felt During Testing\n- Good for: Group sessions, mental stimulation, social events or nights out\n- Not good for: Helping with alertness, bedtime consumption\n- Effects felt: Bubbly, creative, social, whimsy\nEditor’s note:\nThis review was originally published on May 24, 2022, and recently updated on March 6, 2023 to reflect our feedback for three new products.\nJanuary 5, 2024: We added a review of the Fruit Jam Gummies.",
