    "text": "Topaz Photo AI supercharges your image quality so you can focus on the creative part of photography.\nTopaz Photo AI is auto-pilot for your image quality needs. Import an image to Topaz Photo AI and it will use specially trained AI models to first detect the unique problems in detail, clarity, and resolution before intelligently applying adjustments that will maximize your image quality. This software by the team at Topaz Labs is created to be an all-in-one solution to enhance your images using the power of machine-learning AI technology.\nFor users experienced with Topaz Labs image quality applications, it combines the functionality of DeNoise AI, Sharpen AI, and Gigapixel AI into one application with an intelligent auto setting that can pick adjustments with strengths for you.\nNote: You can download Topaz Photo AI from here and run the installer. When you open Topaz Photo AI, you will be prompted to activate the application, purchase it, or to use the demo mode. Click the demo mode to use the trial. The trial lets you use all the features of the application with the exception of saving/exporting a file. All features and plugins are included when you install.

If any models are found to be missing/corrupted it will automatically download them. You can turn this off under Preferences > General, but missing models will lead to errors eventually. If the installer has worked correctly, you may never see this interaction. New installs will now default to enabling DNG compression on export For those who have installed before this, you must select and save a DNG with compression on by selecting DNG under export settings. After that it should default to on for all DNG saves, even when using preserve. Fixed tile artifacting issues when using Upscale with Standard or High Fidelity models Note: For Apple Silicon Macs only: Disabling the Neural Engine prevents these artifacts, but will slow down processing. To disable Neural Engine, there is a new toggle in the right panel when selecting Standard or High Fidelity models.

You can always re-attempt to save any files that have this error. We will have a better fix for this in the future. Also due to the previous versions overwriting image data immediately, processing may feel slower but this is just because more images are being fully processed.\nKeep Reading Fast servers and clean downloads.
