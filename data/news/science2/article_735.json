    "text": "KUTV — The following information was submitted by Medtronic. The world’s smallest pacemakers are making a big difference in cardiac care. The FDA-approved Micra™ leadless pacemakers are the size of large vitamin capsules, and the newest Micra devices now have batteries that last between 16 and 17 years – which means that more than 80% of Micra patients will only need one pacemaker for life. Patient Mekaela Davis shared how she found peace of mind thanks to the therapy she received after her heart stopped for more than 8 seconds. Dr. Rob Kowal explained how Micra pacemakers help patients like Mekaela who experience symptoms related to slow, irregular heartbeats. Dr. Kowal is a cardiac electrophysiologist (a cardiologist who specializes in the heart’s electrical rhythms) and the general manager of Cardiac Pacing Therapies at Medtronic. A pacemaker is an implanted heart device that sends electrical pulses to the heart to help it beat at a normal rate and rhythm. The Micra pacemakers are so small that they leave no bump under the skin and no chest scar, and they do not require leads (or wires) to pace the heart. Medtronic is the global leader in pacing technologies. The recent FDA approval for the Micra AV2 and VR2 devices builds on the Medtronic legacy in cardiac pacing, which includes: inventing the first wearable pacemaker in 1957, launching the first pacemaker for use in MRIs in 2011, creating and launching the first leadless pacemaker in 2015, launching the first leadless pacemaker to coordinate the heart's electrical signals by sensing atrial activity - without a lead or device in the atria - in 2020, and gaining regulatory approval for the first pacing system to activate the heart's natural electrical system, conduction system pacing (approval via the His-bundle in 2018 and via the left bundle branch area in 2022).
