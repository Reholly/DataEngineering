    "text": "PORTLAND, OR - In the last 20 years, Lindsey Anderson, leading online business consultant, has become one of the most influential voices in the digital marketing space. To date, her work has been showcased in several major media publications such as Fox, NBC, CBS, Huffington Post, ABC, and others. A business scaling expert, Lindsey offers multiple programs—including the Content That Converts 90-Day Transformation Program and the 1:1 Mastery Program—that help coaches, consultants and experts generate more high-quality leads and convert them into paying clients. She is also the driving force behind the Build and Monetize (BAM) Agency. Her agency goes beyond conventional advertising services, offering a comprehensive approach to elevate marketing and sales efforts. The BAM Agency doesn't just stop at running paid advertising campaigns; they actively support product launches and put their client’s entire marketing and sales strategy into overdrive. Their expertise extends beyond tactical aspects, encompassing years of business strategy, market positioning, and brain-based learning design. Author of the best-selling book, The Click Technique, and host of The Millionaire Maker Show podcast, Lindsey has developed several online marketing strategies that have been instrumental in helping entrepreneurs scale their online businesses. Now, she will be putting her business acumen to the test when she appears on Netflix’s highly anticipated reality TV series, The Trust: A Game of Greed. The upcoming show’s premise revolves around a group of 11 strangers who are competing to win the grand prize—a quarter of a million dollars. The catch? The contestants are awardedthe prize money at the beginning of the show in the form of a trust. The money belongs to them, and if they survive the entire season, each contestant will be able to claim an even share. Unlike the average game show, the contestants’ fates are entirely dependent on each other, facing the dilemma of sharing the prize equally or strategically voting each other out. With the power to eliminate a contestant with just one vote, Lindsey and her peers grapple with the decision between relationships and money. The Trust is a riveting social experiment filled with drama, featuring betrayal, deception, paranoia, and greed as contestants fight to keep the big prize. The show challenges the conventional timeline of trust development, exploring whether trust can emerge among strangers when money is on the line.
