    "text": "About a year ago, the company QuantumScape supplied prototypes of solid-state batteries to its cooperation partners – car manufacturers. PowerCo, a subsidiary of the Volkswagen concern, which focuses directly on the development of battery\ntechnology, has conducted endurance tests and praised it – by continuing to work with this technology, we can arrive at batteries that will be able to travel 500 thousand kilometers without losing their capacity or energy capacity.\nBattery degradation is one of the issues that worries many people who would like to buy an electric car, especially a used one. A new car has a certain battery capacity, but with the passage of time and kilometers, it decreases a little, that is, battery degradation occurs. For example, a new car can travel 400 kilometers when fully charged. After 100 thousand kilometers, this same car will be able to drive, say, 350 kilometers fully charged under the same conditions. A purely illustrative example.\nVolkswagen is one of QuantumScape’s biggest partners, supporting the company for a long time, so they receive various prototypes for testing.\nPowerCo tested these battery cells through more than 1,000 charge cycles. For a car with a range of 500-600 kilometers, this means about 500-600 thousand kilometers. Test results show that the tested battery cells retained more than 95% of their initial capacity after 1000 charge/discharge cycles, which is a very high rate. These cells also demonstrated very good results in other parameters.\nOf course, the question is how and when it will go into mass production and how much it will cost. Well-functioning prototypes are great, but if such batteries are difficult to produce in sufficient numbers or are prohibitively expensive, they make less sense. The parties involved are determined to continue working to gradually introduce these technologies into production and also into the machines that will hit our streets.\nRead more: National News Agency - The US Federal Reserve raises interest rates and lowers growth expectations\n2024-01-05 07:30:00\n#million #kilometers #losing #battery #capacity #QuantumScape #electric #car #batteries #prove #tests",
