    "text": "Ronan Hale was the hat-trick hero as he grabbed all three of his side’s goals in a flattering 3-0 victory over a dejected Coleraine in the fifth-round of the Clearer Water Irish Cup tie at the Showgrounds. All three goals came in extra-time, after a goal-less 90 minutes, that saw both sides lose a man each to a red card. The defeat heaps more misery on under-pressure manager Oran Kearney whose Coleraine side exited the Irish Cup at this stage for only the third time in 16 years. With new signings Jack Scott and Rory Brown starting for the Bannsiders, hopes were high of a turn of fortune for a side on the back of four straight defeats. However, it was the side from Solitude that had the opening chance of the game after only five minutes. Ben Wilson got the better of Dean Jarvis down Coleraine’s left and whipped an inviting ball across the front of goal, where Sean Stewart raced in from the opposite flank, but he failed to hit the target with the goal at his mercy. The first period was an open affair with both sides showing some attacking intent, however it was the away side that looked the more likely to score; that was until the half-hour mark when the hosts had a glorious opportunity to break the deadlock. A misplaced pass out of defence from Mr.Reliable Johnny Addis arrived at the feet of Jamie Glackin, who picked out Lee Lynch, who in turn tried to pick out the on-rushing Scott. But his pass was a poor one and the debutant couldn’t get on the end of the ball as the score remained goal-less and that’s the way it stayed until the break. Jim Magilton’s visitors started the second period on top but failed to work goalkeeper Brown in the Coleraine goal, as both sides became less prepared to take risks as the half progressed. As the game petered out towards extra-time, it was the production of cards from referee Raymond Crangle, rather than goals that would make headlines. With 10 minutes on the clock, Reds substitute Sam Ashford was shown a straight red card after a high challenge on Dean Jarvis. He was swiftly followed by Coleraine player Lyndon Kane, on his 300th club appearance, for his second-yellow card for a follow-through tackle that seemed harsh, as neither side could find a winner in 90 minutes. After a tetchy start to extra-time, on 95 minutes, Rory Hale thought he had broken the deadlock. Ben Wilson with a smart lay-off to the incoming midfielder, who smashed an effort form 20 yards, but it was expertly saved by Brown in goal at full stretch to his left. However, it was his brother Ronan who did open the scoring nine minutes later. The striker scored his sixth goal in six games with a stunning curling effort into the top right-hand corner of the Coleraine net from just outside the area, giving Brown no chance this time. As Coleraine pushed for an equaliser, Ronan Hale grabbed his second of the night four minutes from time to send the Reds through. A smart turn inside the box and a cool finish broke Coleraine hearts. However, the younger Hale wasn’t done there, and within thirty seconds had his hat-trick. A through ball from midfield beat the Coleraine offside trap, and there was Hale with all the time in the world to beat Brown and slot home for a memorable victory. Coleraine: Brown, Kane (capt), D. Jarvis, A. Jarvis, McDaid, Farren, Lynch, Glackin, J. Scott, O’Mahony, A. Scott. Subs: Gallagher, Lowry, O’Donnell, Cole, McLaughlin, Devine, O’Hara.
