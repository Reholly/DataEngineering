    "text": "Japanese cars have always been unrivaled in terms of reliability, but not the best in terms of off-road capabilities. In recent years, many automakers from the “land of the rising sun” have significantly expanded the line of their crossovers and SUVs, but have not forgotten about their special versions, aimed at overcoming all kinds of obstacles. Daily-Motor.ru has compiled a list of the top five Japanese SUVs that perform well away from the asphalt. Toyota 4Runner TRD Pro Designed specifically for Off-Road, the 4Runner is capable of going where a regular SUV can’t. And all thanks to Fox shock absorbers, as well as a ground clearance of about 23 cm. All this comes in addition to an advanced all-wheel drive system and a multi-link rear suspension that improves on-board comfort. Subaru Outback Wilderness Subaru has always been known for its excellent all-wheel drive system. And the Outback is no exception. But the Wilderness version makes these figures even better thanks to an increased ground clearance of up to 24 cm, as well as good approach/departure angles and the presence of “toothy” tires. Toyota Sequoia TRD Pro Another member of the Toyota TRD Pro family, which is designed to go where a regular Sequoia shouldn’t go. It has an independent rear suspension equipped with a limited-slip differential and a fully locking rear differential. The icing on the cake is the 5.7-liter V8 engine, which produces almost 400 horsepower. Nissan Navara Pro-4X A special version of the popular Nissan pickup truck, which is able to cope with its task (off-road driving) even better than its usual version.

Ground clearance exceeds 25 centimeters, and all-wheel drive is virtually trouble-free. Toyota RAV4 Adventure Offroad Package II The slightly raised version of the best-selling RAV4, adapted for off-road use, differs from simple crossovers by the presence of a special plastic body kit, protected from damage in the form of small scratches. The car will definitely not catch stars from the sky on an “Off-road” vehicle, but its owner can more actively “attack” obstacles without fear of causing unpleasant damage to the appearance of the SUV.
