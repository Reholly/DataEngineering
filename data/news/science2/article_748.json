    "text": "Background: Neuroinflammation has been linked to some central alterations such as cognitive and memory impairment which are prominent features of many neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease etc. This study explored the cognitive-enhancing properties of a flavonoid, diosmin, on lipopolysaccharide-induced cognitive impairment in mice.\nMethodology: Twenty-eight mice were divided into four groups. These groups were scheduled to receive either vehicle or any of the two doses of diosmin. Groups 2-4 were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 250 µg/kg, i.p.) daily for seven days. Afterwards, all mice were subjected to the Y-maze test and the novel object recognition test (NORT) to assess their spatial and non-spatial working memory, respectively. Subsequently, the mice were sacrificed and brain samples were harvested for biochemical analysis. The data was analysed using one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a post hoc test. The level of significance was set at p<0.05.\nResults: Our data shows that diosmin significantly reversed the LPS-induced neuroinflammation by reducing proinflammatory mediators in the brain and subsequently improving mice memory.\nConclusion: Diosmin possesses properties that could be beneficial in symptom management in such inflammation-related disorders.",
