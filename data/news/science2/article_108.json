I\nwill upload a schematic of the adapter soon, it will be easier to\nunderstand than me trying to explain.\nI have done some measurements on them to make the xover. If\nsome one can merge different measures to a polat plot I'll be\nglad to mail them. The diffucalty to measure them is to choose\nwhere to place the mic, the frequency response change with\nboth distance and angle. My room is so tight that I can't listen on\naxis, so for the cross over design I measured them between the\ncenter cell and the one at it's side.\nI have no problem with vibrations what so ever in these horns. If\nI knock on them they are dead silent. When all the cells were put\ntogether three of four sides were covered vith fiberglass. Then I\npoured polyester from above so all the voids between the cells\nwere filled with polyester. The horns are filled with about 20 kg\nof polyester each. With the JBL 2445 they weigh just above 40\nkg a piece. You can lift one by your selve but it is not a nice experience.\nWithout xover the horn have good output down to about 250-\n300 Hz, but due to the variations in the acoustic reactanse and\nresistanse I would not cross them lower than 400-500 Hz. this is\nsomething that I found out after the horns were built. My\nintention was to use it from 350-400 Hz. Would be intresting to\ntry them with JBL midrangedriver, because the 2445 is not ment\nto be used lower than 500 Hz.\nA friend of mine has the Altec 288 and 1505B, his horn are sand filled and that works too, the black kloggy stuff is not too nice to handle.\nThe small one has a flare of 300 Hz and it is also a pure\nexponential horn. The one who built that one is using it together\nwith JBL 2226 and a RCF tweeter, The small horn goes higher\nand a bit more open sound if both horns (183 and 300 Hz) are\ncrossed high. That's why I chose a quite low xover freq, 3000 Hz\nand up to that freq. it sounds really good.\nView from a multicell, at a friends house\nI'll come back to continue...\nMember\nJoined 2002\nI noticed the clear fill after I posted...\nConsider an oil finish on the wood, if you have not yet done anything to it....\nThe ratings in terms of frequency for the compression drivers are based on two things:\n- power handling, or full power bandwidth at the rated power\n- physical compliance of the diaphragm's surround\nSo, if the diaphragm can move below the rated LF cutoff in a linear way, the driver will go down to whatever freq the horn permits. But the manufacturer will only rate the driver to a particular frequency based upon its ability to handle full output, and still remain within xmax. That usually means a higher cutoff than the diaphragm can actually handle, IF the max SPL does not exceed some Xmax figure.\nIn typical home use that is way way below where it becomes a problem. Consider that most compression drivers (pro ones) are intended to run up to about 128dB SPL, whereas the typical average listening level is <100dB at home... quite a bit of headroom.\nCertainly enough headroom for careful testing at minimum.\nI use a Japanese driver with a first order filter (one cap) on my 300Hz. horns and have played direct into the system with my band (electric guitars, drums, bass, vocals) in the listening room, uncompressed, at ~100dBSPL average in the space with no ill effects. The JBL and Altecs might not do as well (different diaphragm construction) but worst case you can put a spacer under the mount (frequently they are supplied by the Mfrs to recone houses to center the VC windings in the gap) and gain enough clearance IF there is a slight excursion (Xmax) problem found...\nIf you say that you have variations below your present xover point, it's likely due to insufficient mouth size, and/or that the horns are foreshortened a bit to be similar to the slightly shorter 500Hz style horns... which is ok, but as I said before I have had a far better listening experience when the horn to midbass xover is lower, not higher, and the horn carries the \"voice frequencies\" (aka \"telephone frequencies\") completely - ie. <300Hz and up...\nMaybe for your next horn?\nRegards,\nConsider an oil finish on the wood, if you have not yet done anything to it....\nThe ratings in terms of frequency for the compression drivers are based on two things:\n- power handling, or full power bandwidth at the rated power\n- physical compliance of the diaphragm's surround\nSo, if the diaphragm can move below the rated LF cutoff in a linear way, the driver will go down to whatever freq the horn permits.
