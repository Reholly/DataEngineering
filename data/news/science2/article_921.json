    "text": "Kaitlyn Siragusa is one of the [highest-earning streamers](https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/amouranth-reveals-staggering-all-time-earnings-from-onlyfans-1866478/) on the internet, but her “AI counterpart” isn’t too far behind. The woman known online as Amouranth revealed that her foray into the world of AI took in $34,000 of revenue during its first 24 hours of sales activity. In May 2023, Siragusa announced that she had [teamed up with a company called Forever Voices](https://www.tubefilter.com/2023/05/19/amouranth-forever-voices-companion-bot/) to develop “Amouranth AI,” an artificial intelligence molded in her likeness. She advertised the AI as a “companion” trained to mimic her “unique personality and inflections. Many of the 6.3 million followers on the [Amouranth Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/amouranth) took advantage of the opportunity to spend time with Siragusa — even if they were only hanging out with an artificial representation of the real Amouranth. In a follow-up to her Amouranth AI announcement tweet, Siragusa celebrated the product’s early success. She noted that the average buyer spent at least $20 to chat with the companion, and about 40% of chatters do not follow the Amouranth account.

She has claimed to [make $15,000](https://www.tubefilter.com/2023/06/30/amouranth-sleep-streams-creator-economy-only-fans-conversions/) for each “sleep stream,” in which her viewers watch her hit the hay. Those odd revenue streams supplement the income Siragusa makes on OnlyFans, where her monthly take [surpasses seven figures](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/amouranth-reveals-her-onlyfans-earnings-154510173.html). Amouranth AI has [drawn some criticism](https://www.thegamer.com/amouranths-new-ai-app-creepy-influencers-parasocial/) since its initial announcement. Detractors have argued that the companion is a “creepy” innovation that intensifies the parasocial relationships between creators and fans. The person who lends her likeness to Amouranth AI doesn’t see the product as a contributor to the [epidemic of loneliness](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf). Instead, Siragusa argued that the companion is a source of relief for those who chat with her. “A lot of people are saying this type of thing is the cause of the loneliness epidemic — I disagree,” [she wrote](https://twitter.com/wildkait/status/1743011351260172420). “This doesn’t cause loneliness — it’s probably closer to being therapeutic. It’s what people reach for to refrain from feeling alone.”",
