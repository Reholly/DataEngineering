    "text": "OAK HARBOR, Ohio (WTVG) - Protecting fish, wildlife, and plants was the goal of the Endangered Species Act. Now, 50 years later, Jason Lewis, refuge manager at Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge in Oak Harbor said the legislation passed in 1973 has had lasting effects protecting the local ecosystem here in Northwest Ohio.“In the 60s when we started having DDT (Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) and other pesticides started having impacts on our species across the country. And in that 50 years we’ve had nearly 17,000 species that have been protected,” Lewis said. “It also provided as recovery responsibility; recovery actions have to be taken.”Lewis added that those actions can be seen today with the bald eagle population in Northwest Ohio.“1979 we had four nesting pairs in the whole state of Ohio, four nesting pairs, you fast forward to 2020, we had over 700 nesting pairs statewide,” Lewis said.The Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge plays host to 11,000 acres of land. Within that, there are over 200 species of birds including anywhere from 16-20 nesting pairs of bald eagles. In 2007, the bald eagle was delisted as an endangered species.Lewis added that it’s not just birds that have been protected since 1973. Plants have benefitted as well.“Here locally we have the Eastern Prairie Fringed Orchid, Ottawa has, our high count here is over 2,000 Plants, so we’re one of the last remaining strongholds in the whole state of Ohio,” Lewis said.
