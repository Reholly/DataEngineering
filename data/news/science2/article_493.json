    "text": "Is Lethal Company Coming To\nPS5? Developed by solo coder Zeekerss, Lethal Company has been drumming up positive reviews on Steam following its release into Early Access on October 23, 2023, leaving many folk to question if it’s coming to consoles or not. Is a Lethal Company PS5 release on the cards? Let’s find out!\nIs Lethal Company Coming To PS5?\nThere’s been no official announcement regarding Lethal Company coming to PS5 or Xbox Series X/S at this point. The game has only just entered early access for the PC, so if a console version was planned, it probably wouldn’t happen until the full version of the game is available. After all, Lethal Company is still technically in development, so don’t expect a PS5 version to see the light of day for a while.\nWhat Is Lethal Company?\nHere’s the official blurb:\nYou are a contracted worker for the Company. Your job is to collect scrap from abandoned, industrialized moons to meet the Company’s profit quota. You can use the cash you earn to travel to new moons with higher risks and rewards–or you can buy fancy suits and decorations for your ship. Experience nature, scanning any creature you find to add them to your bestiary. Explore the wondrous outdoors and rummage through their derelict, steel and concrete underbellies. Just never miss the quota.",
