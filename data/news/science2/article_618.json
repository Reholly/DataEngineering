    "text": "Ubisoft's latest entry in the Prince of Persia series caught my attention with the unique twist of a new protagonist, Sargon, one of the Immortals, storming into Mount Qaf to rescue Prince Ghassan. But as a platforming fan, the world itself caught my eye the most. The latest trailer for Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is available on [Ubisoft's](https://www.youtube.com/@Ubisoft) YouTube channel and showcases the delightful world players will explore. Check it out to see the varied biomes you can explore, including Persian deserts, mountainous ruins, mystical forests, and even the deadly sea. Fortunately, you don't have to wait for full release and can check out the [demo for Prince of Persia The Lost Crown](https://progameguides.com/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown/how-to-play-the-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-demo/) ahead of launch day. Related: [Assassin’s Creed Mirage Codes] Ubisoft has paid great attention to level design and detail, and it shows. Aside from fluid movement, one of my favorite aspects of sidescrolling platformers is exploring the world, discovering secrets, and solving puzzles. With the varied environments in Prince of Persia The Lost Crown, I can't wait to dive in—even if there is an underwater level. While players like myself are used to playing as the Prince, The Lost Crown puts players in the role Sargon. Sargon is a mighty warrior and member of the Persian Immortals who must rescue the Prince instead, placing the former protagonist in the role of damsel in distress. The good news is players will be right at home controlling Sargon, as he retains the series' familiar time-based moves and mechanics.
