    "text": "2024 Toyota GR 86 Gets Attractive Pricing, Trueno Variant [Julien Amado](/en/authors/julien-amado/) The Toyota GR86 is one of the rare affordable sports cars left on the face of the Earth. Its 2.4-liter flat-four engine isn't the most powerful on the market with 228 hp, but the performance it delivers is more than sufficient considering the weight and chassis of the GR 86. While the specifications of the 2024 model have already been published, Toyota Canada has finally released pricing details. The base GR 86 with a manual gearbox is priced at $32,350 (MSRP), which is quite good for what you get. Of course, the GR 86’s interior isn't the most technologically advanced on the market, but the equipment it contains is generous. The base model includes 17-inch alloy wheels, LED headlights and daytime running lights, heated mirrors, push-button keyless ignition, a 7-inch screen and a 6-speaker audio system. - Also: [Toyota Spices Up GR Corolla, GR 86 and GR Supra for 2024](https://www.guideautoweb.com/en/articles/71012/toyota-spices-up-gr-corolla-gr-86-and-gr-supra-for-2024/) - Also: [Most and Least Liked Vehicles in 2023 According to Consumer Reports](https://www.guideautoweb.com/en/articles/69425/most-and-least-liked-vehicles-in-2023-according-to-consumer-reports/) The same model with automatic transmission costs $2,000 more. For this price, buyers also receive a suite of advanced safety systems including collision avoidance, adaptive cruise control, a lane departure warning system and a preceding vehicle start-up alert. For added efficiency and sportiness, the manual and automatic Premium versions (priced at $35,350 and $37,350, respectively) add 18-inch wheels shod with Michelin Pilot Sport 4 tires, a specific rear spoiler, an adaptive lighting system, aluminum pedals, heated front seats (covered in leather/alcantara), automatic high beams and a blind spot detection system. TRUENO Special Edition Toyota has added the GR 86 TRUENO Edition at the top of the range for 2024, with an MSRP of $39,150. Available only with a manual gearbox, this special version is based on the Premium model, but adds Brembo brakes and Sachs shock dampers. In addition to these technical upgrades, the car also receives some unique elements, including select body components painted in black (spoiler, mirrors, door handles, hood), specific 18-inch wheels, and an exclusive black and red interior. The base and Premium models are available right away. The TRUENO’s production has been capped at just 50 units for all of Canada. [Share on Facebook]",
