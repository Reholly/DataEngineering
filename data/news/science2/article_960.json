The key areas to tackle are the detergent drawer, drum, seals, window and filter.\n“Firstly I would locate the filter and remove it. Soak the filter itself in a bucket of warm water with one part of white vinegar added while you tackle other areas of the machine.\n\"If you can reach inside the filter housing, then clean this area using a vinegar spray which is antibacterial and will destroy any mould spores in there.\"\nThe same vinegar spray and a cloth can be used to wipe down all the seals inside the washing machine.
