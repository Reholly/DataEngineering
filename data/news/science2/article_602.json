    "text": "The fitness app incentivizing exercise just got rewarded in its own right, notching $4.16 million in post-seed funding to build and scale Going the extra mile has never looked more attractive. Muuvr, the fitness app that motivates runners, cyclists and swimmers through reward programs and community engagement, announced a significant investment to expand its platform. Muuvr surpassed its original funding target with a $4.16 million post-seed funding round, the company announced. That, combined with $1.67 million in founder loans, sets Muuvr’s total capital increase at $5.84 million. The post-seed funding round was led by what Muuvr described as “influential private individuals and family offices. Investors include 10-time Ironman and Ironman 70.3 World Champion Daniela Ryf as well as four-time Ironman Switzerland Champion Jan van Berkel. Gamification With Real-Life Rewards Muuvr launched a beta version of its app back in October, which is currently available on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Once completing the free download, users can log in and track their movement during a variety of exercise activities. In doing so, users earn “Muuvs” which work as a virtual currency capable of unlocking awards, experiences and even products in the Muuvr Marketplace. Users can also connect with others on the platform to share progress and motivate each other “Exercise and health are so important, both to me as a lifelong athlete and to our society,” Ryf said. “Muuvr offers a mechanism to foster and reward physical activity and healthy behavior, which is why I choose to engage with Muuvr as a sports person and now as an investor.” More Fitness Funding Muuvr isn’t the only fitness app to expand its financial resources over the last several months. Ladder, a daily strength training app, closed a $12 million Series A round in early December. Runna, which coaches runners via artificial intelligence (AI), also just brought in $6.3 million . CoPilot, another AI-powered fitness coaching app, recently raised $6.5 million . The incoming funds open a variety of doors for Muuvr, which was only just founded in 2022. The company lists app development, marketing and acquisition campaigns and the establishment of new partnerships as areas they intend to flesh out with the new capital. “It’s not just about financial backing; it’s a testament to the belief in our purpose to revolutionize how athletes engage with their sport,” said Michael Hartweg, Muuvr co-founder and CEO. “This funding is a catalyst, propelling us towards our dream of creating an unparalleled digital experience that celebrates and rewards the dedication and spirit of every athlete.”",
