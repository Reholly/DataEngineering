    "text": "At Curricular, my team and I spend hundreds of hours every month reviewing courses and programs from around the web to recommend the very best. Our goal is to help developers cut through the marketing hype, make quick and confident buying decisions, and get the most from their time and money. You can check out all our learning guides at [curricular.dev](https://curricular.dev?utm_source=devto&src=Pythonguide). We spent several hundred hours meticulously testing and reviewing several dozen Python courses from various vendors around the web. Here are the absolute best online Python courses available right now. We independently test and review every course that we recommend. If you purchase a course we recommend, we may earn a commission. Our team includes developers and learning experts who have worked at most of the major learning platforms, but we don't have active employment relationships with any.
