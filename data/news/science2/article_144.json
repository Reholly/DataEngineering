For instance, key + X will open quick links for easy access to commands, files, and prompts. Some shortcuts can also be fun. The Windows key + period (.) or semicolon (;) opens emoji, GIF, and clipboard shortcuts for easy insertion of text additions. And, of course, there's always this oldie but a goodie: Ctrl + Shift + Esc, which opens Windows Task Manager to force-stop tasks. Windows keyboard shortcuts can streamline writing, research, and web browsing to make everyday tasks a little bit easier. From quickly checking your settings and launching emoji and GIF keyboards to utilizing accessibility tools, the shortcut updates that come with Windows 11 streamline laptop and desktop workflows. Whether you consider yourself a pro of Windows or find tech intimidating, our list can help improve how you use your computer.\nRelated How to set up Windows shortcuts on your keyboard and what they can do Windows keyboard shortcuts are the fastest way to perform common tasks. Here's a list of the most useful shortcuts, as well as how to create them. Let's first make sure your device is running Windows 11. To do this quickly, on your keyboard input the following:\nPress the Windows key + R at the same time. A search box will pop up for you to input text. Type winver into the search box and press enter or click OK. If the above prompt displays Windows 11 OS, congratulations, you can use all the shortcuts below to optimize your workflow and have a little fun with Windows.\nBefore we get into the best of Windows 11 list, there are a few tried and true shortcuts that every Windows PC user should have in their toolbox, regardless of their version of Windows. As Pocket-lint's copy editor, I use the five keyboard shortcuts below constantly throughout the day to highlight and copy text, find specific words on pages, and undo errors.\nFind\nCtrl + F\nOpen a search box in the window, so you can locate words, phrases, and letters\nHighlight\nCtrl + A\nCovers all the text and images on a webpage or document\nUndo\nCtrl + Z\nReverses recent typing\nCopy\nCtrl + C\nMakes a copy of the highlighted text\nPaste\nCtrl + V\nAdds copied text to a page\nNow that you're equipped with my most used keyboard shortcuts, let's dive into the newest and most exciting Windows 11 quick prompts you can launch with your keyboard .\nRelated Did your Windows 11 taskbar just disappear? Here's why and how to fix it The Windows 11 taskbar is a vital part of everyone's workflow. But it can go missing sometimes. Here's how to troubleshoot and restore it. 1 Open quick links\nWindows key + X Quick links will provide a pop-up list with incredibly useful commands, files, and prompts you can locate with a stroke of two keys instead of digging around trying to remember where your network connections, task manager, or settings live. Some of the quick links I used most often are the File Explorer shortcut, Task Manager, and quick shutdown.\n2 Open emoji, GIF, and clipboard shortcut\nWindows key + period (.) or + semicolon (;) -- to open the emoji and GIF keyboard Windows key + V -- opens up the same shortcut box, but brings you to the clipboard section These three different shortcut options all bring you to the same pop-up window. It is a window that shows six tabs covering different additions you can insert within your text. The six tabs are: recently used, an emoji keyboard üëª, a GIF keyboard via Tenor, a Kaomoji keyboard (‚ùÅ¬¥‚ó°`‚ùÅ), special characters, and your clipboard showing your most recent 25 copied items. I love adding GIFs to friendly chats and personal emails without downloading extensions or additional apps.\n3 Screenshots and recording\nPrtScn or Prt Sc --(depending on model) opens the snipping tool and copies screenshots to the clipboard Windows key + Shift + S -- opens the snipping tool to take screenshot specific areas on the screen I spend a lot of my day formatting images and creating screenshots of products, so we can put them into articles. These two shortcut options allow you to take precise screenshots quickly, without downloading external applications or software. The time saved to grab a screenshot while I'm still within the appropriate window, without launching a separate program, has saved me hours each week.\n4 Open Windows Task Manager\nCtrl + Shift + Esc When you want to check out your background performance or see which window is slowing down your computer, the Windows Task Manager is the place to go. Before upgrading to my new Acer Swift X this past fall, I used to check on the Task Manager daily to force-stop tasks and check on my older laptop's performance. While I don't have to do that so consistently now, it's still a great tool to quickly access a useful report of your device's functions.\n5 Cast from Quick Settings\nWindows key + K Casting might be new to some, or old hat to others, but it's a cool feature that you can utilize to mirror your laptop screen to another device. This shortcut is a favorite when my partner is searching for a live college football game that is easiest to find on a laptop instead of a streaming TV app.\nIt's straightforward to use and only requires a few additional steps on the device you'd like to cast your screen to for full set up. My casts usually take under five seconds to go live on my TV. To disconnect the cast, simply input Windows key + K again and select Disconnect.\n6 Delete without the Recycle Bin\nShift + Delete To permanently delete files on a Windows device, usually you must first delete the files, then empty the Recycle Bin, otherwise a deleted copy will still live in your Recycle Bin. This shortcut skips the initial delete and permanently deletes a file on the first try.\n7 Launch Windows Copilot\nWindows key + C Copilot is a new service Microsoft has launched to try to stay relevant in the generative AI game since they discontinued Cortana. Copilot is a chatbot developed by Microsoft designed to answer your questions in a natural language, summarize content, customize your settings for you, troubleshoot issues, and perform basic actions.\nThis all depends on what you input into Copilot, and it offers three conversation styles: more creative, more balanced, and more precise. I mostly use Copilot when I have questions about Windows settings or my laptop, but it's fun to play around with for silly questions and prompts.\nRelated What is Microsoft Copilot? Microsoft's AI explained Microsoft's AI leverages the capabilities of OpenAI's GPT-4. Here's everything you need to know, including each Copilot's functionality. 8 Navigating Tabs and Windows\nCtrl + Tab or Ctrl Page Down , cycle through current windows tabs in order from left to right Ctrl + Shift + Tab or Ctrl Page Up , move backwards through current window tabs from right to left Windows + Tab toggle through various open program tabs These are staples in my workday, as like many others, I tend to have a minimum of four windows open with at least 10 tabs in each window. I find the Windows + Tab much easier to use than clicking through and opening every program from the taskbar at the bottom of the screen, as it provides a quick preview of all operating windows.\n9 Quickly hide your current screen\nWindows key + D hides and displays the desktop Windows key + L locks computer Windows key + M minimizes all windows Windows key + Shift + M restore minimized windows There are plenty of reasons you may want to minimize your screen quickly from prying eyes. My favorite of the four options above is Windows key + D, if it's not anything important, but if I'm shopping for presents for my family, I tend to lean toward a quick Windows key + L to lock the computer screen away from the eyes of nosy loved ones.\n10 Accessibility settings\nWindows key + U opens all accessibility settings Windows key + H launch voice typing Windows key + Ctrl + O turn on the on-screen keyboard Windows 11 comes with a slew of accessibility keyboard shortcuts. When you want to look through the entirety of the accessibility settings, use the Windows key + U. When you would like to prompt voice typing and the on-screen keyboard, you can use the shortcuts above or find them within the main accessibility settings. For a full list of accessibility shortcuts, check out Microsoft's explainer .\nRelated How to add alt text on Instagram (and why you may want to) Make your Instagram posts more accessible by adding alt text to your photos. Here's how. 11 Enable and customize the screen narrator\nWindows key + Ctrl + Enter turn narrator on Windows key + Ctrl + N go to narrator settings for customizations Voice typing is one useful accessibility setting you can turn on, but my other favorite is the screen narrator. As someone who experiences screen sensitivity with migraines, sometimes enabling the screen reader is an absolute gift. And it doesn't hurt that you can customize the narrator's voice to your preference. I'd recommend customizing the narrator's voice prior to testing out this tool, as I find some of the voice can be jarring.\n12 Open LinkedIn\nCtrl + Shift + Alt + Win + L This one's a little niche, but I find it exciting that it exists at all. And if you are job searching, write this one down. I'd love to see more shortcuts to launch specific sites in the future developed standard in the keyboard instead of setting them up in custom shortcuts.\n13 Display notifications and calendar\nWindows logo key + N Personally, I need to see a calendar to visualize dates and project timelines. I keep a relatively up-to-date personal calendar, but lugging that out each time I'm searching for a specific day isn't realistic. The Windows key + N prompts the calendar and your notification box to pop up for quick reference, something I use at least two or three times a day when planning out deadlines.\n14 Quick access Windows 11 volume mixers\nCtrl + Windows Key + V Depending on how many inputs and windows with various sounds you have playing, it will show you tons of volume-level mixers to adjust as you please.\n15 Xbox Game Bar settings\nWindows key + G opens Xbox Game Bar Windows logo key + Alt + B turns HDR on and off (when Game Bar is open) Windows key + Alt + PrtScn saves screenshots of games in focus to file (when Game Bar is open) Windows logo key + Alt + R records video of games in focus (when Game Bar is open) This one is for the Xbox gamers. If you haven't explored the Xbox Game Bar on Windows, this is your sign to check it out. For the specific shortcuts above, you have to first open the Xbox Game Bar with Windows key + G, then the world (or the bar) is your oyster.\n0:52\nRelated Alexa for Windows 10 and 11: What you can and can't do with Alexa on the PC You can use Alexa hands-free on your PC.
