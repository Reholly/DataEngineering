    "text": "(NAPSI)—The homebuying journey has undergone a radical transformation in the digital age. Long gone are the days of sifting through stacks of paperwork, replaced by a streamlined, tech-driven consumer experience. As part of this progression, artificial intelligence (AI) is being woven into the fabric of daily life and has the potential to have a massive effect on the path to homeownership, offering tools that make finding and purchasing a home easier than ever before. How AI Changes Homebuying AI has the power to streamline the mortgage process—often the most daunting part of homebuying. A 2023 report by LiveVox found that AI-driven customer experiences scored 20% higher in satisfaction than traditional human-led approaches. Companies such as Rocket Mortgage are now automating document collection, verifying information instantly and even showing loan officers the best mortgage products for their clients. This efficiency speeds up the process and increases confidence for consumers. “AI is not just a technological advancement, it is a transformative force reshaping the homebuying landscape,” said Brian Woodring, Chief Information Officer for Rocket Mortgage. “AI is the compass guiding us toward a future where homeownership is accessible and stress free for everyone.” Beyond the financing, remote home tours—powered by AI—can virtually transport shoppers to a prospective home, letting them explore every nook and cranny with 360-degree views. AI-driven platforms can also sift through mountains of listings to recommend homes that match a buyer’s preferences, budget and lifestyle, creating a personalized experience and saving countless hours of manual search. The Importance of Human Involvement with AI While AI is certainly transformative, it is not a one-size-fits-all solution. When it comes to such things as credit decisioning, humans still take the lead. Credit decisions are complex and nuanced, requiring a deep understanding of a person’s financial history and current circumstances. AI can provide data and options, but the final call should always be made by a human who can interpret the subtleties and make an informed decision. Moreover, AI cannot replace the personal touch of a real estate agent or the reassurance and expertise of a loan officer. These human interactions and relationships are vital to the homebuying experience, providing knowledge, negotiation skills and emotional support that AI simply cannot replicate. This combination of AI with the human touch is already showing results. In fact, over the last year, Rocket Mortgage saw it help shorten the amount of time it takes their clients to close on a home purchase by nearly 20%. AI can handle the heavy lifting of data processing and provide valuable insights, but it takes a backseat where humans perform best—building meaningful connections. The Future Of Homebuying As consumers embark on their homeownership adventure, AI will open doors while the professionals will help them cross the threshold into their new home.
