(Nasdaq: SNTI) (“Senti Bio” or the “Company”), a clinical stage biotechnology company developing next-generation cell and gene therapies using its proprietary Gene Circuit platform, today announced plans to streamline its business operations, including reducing its workforce by approximately 37 percent, to enable increased focus on SENTI-202, a first-in-class Logic Gated investigational cell therapy for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (“AML”). The Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application for SENTI-202 was cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in December 2023 and the Company anticipates dosing the first patient in the second quarter of 2024. Additionally, the Company will continue to support the clinical development activities of SENTI-301A for the treatment of advanced glypican 3 (“GPC3”)-expressing hepatocellular carcinoma (“HCC”) in China through its partnership with Celest Therapeutics. The Company expects that these resource allocation efforts, combined with other expected receivables, will extend its cash runway into the first quarter of 2025.\n“We have made significant progress toward our mission to advance our Gene Circuit enhanced oncology cell therapies and recently achieved our milestone of IND clearance for SENTI-202, in line with our previous guidance. Despite this progress, we are taking the difficult but necessary steps to enhance our focus on demonstrating clinical proof-of-concept for our Gene Circuit technology and potentially bringing SENTI-202 and SENTI-301A to patients,” said Timothy Lu, MD, PhD, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of Senti Bio. “With these resource allocation efforts, our team will remain laser-focused on the clinical progress of SENTI-202 and supporting our partnership with Celest Therapeutics for SENTI-301A in China. We extend our immense gratitude to our dedicated colleagues impacted by this decision and are committed to supporting them throughout this process.”\nThe Company outlined the following key strategic decisions:\nPrioritize the clinical development of SENTI-202, a potentially first-in-class, off-the-shelf Logic Gated chimeric antigen receptor natural killer (“CAR-NK”) cell therapy product candidate for the treatment of AML and other hematologic malignancies. The Company anticipates the following from the Phase 1 clinical trial: First patient dosed in the second quarter of 2024 Initial efficacy data by year-end 2024 Durability data in 2025 Continue SENTI-301A program work in China through the partnership with Celest Therapeutics; the first patient is anticipated to be dosed in the first half of 2024 Scale back all other research and development initiatives while continuing to support ongoing partnerships with Spark Therapeutics and BlueRock Therapeutics Reduce current headcount by approximately 37 percent; anticipated to be completed in the first quarter of 2024 The Company expects to incur one-time costs of approximately $1 million, of which nearly all are cash expenditures related to severance and are anticipated to be incurred in the first quarter of 2024 The combination of anticipated cost savings, and the Company’s balance of cash, cash equivalents and investment securities of $40.3 million as of November 30, 2023, and other expected receivables, are now expected to fund its revised operating plan into the first quarter of 2025\nAbout Senti Bio\nSenti Biosciences is a biotechnology company developing a new generation of cell and gene therapies for patients living with incurable diseases. To achieve this, Senti Bio is leveraging a synthetic biology platform called Gene Circuits to create therapies with enhanced precision and control. These Gene Circuits are designed to precisely kill cancer cells, spare healthy cells, increase specificity to target cells and control the expression of drugs even after administration. The Company’s wholly-owned pipeline utilizes off-the-shelf chimeric antigen receptor natural killer (CAR-NK) cells, outfitted with Gene Circuits, to target challenging liquid and solid tumor indications. Senti Bio has also preclinically demonstrated the potential breadth Gene Circuits in other modalities, diseases outside of oncology, and continues to advance these capabilities through partnerships with Spark Therapeutics and BlueRock Therapeutics.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release and document contain certain statements that are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
