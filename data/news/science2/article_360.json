    "text": "LEGO’s Braille Bricks are headed to even more languages!\nLEGO launched its Braille Bricks, a set that makes learning Braille in English and French more accessible, in August. Now, kids can play with the sets using German, Spanish, and Italian.\n“For blind and partially sighted children — and adults for that matter — it makes all the difference if they can share their journey of learning braille with the people they love the most,” says Martine Abel-Williamson, President of the World Blind Union. “For the blind community, braille is not just literacy, it’s our entry to independence and inclusion into this world, and to have LEGO Braille Bricks made ava!ilable for the wider public is a massive step forward to ensuring more children will want to learn braille in the first place.”\nThe LEGO Braille Bricks set comes with 287 bricks and two baseplates that are fully compatible with other LEGO sets. The studs on these bricks are arranged to correspond to numbers and letters in the braille system, with the printed version of the symbol or letter below the studs. The set also comes in braille-embossed packaging.\nLEGO Braille Bricks is available online at\nlego.com. LEGO’s website also features activities that will help kids develop the skills they need to learn braille, including building games and Rock, Paper, Scissors.",
