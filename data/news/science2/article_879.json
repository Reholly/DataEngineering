    "text": "Ishod Wair’s love of 1990s basketball heavily influenced the design of his first signature shoe. That same passion for Swoosh history carries over to the sophomore model as his upcoming Ishod 2 acts as an homage to the most iconic running legacy in industry history. Revealed here via official images in three distinctive colorways, the SB Ishod 2 blends skate-shoe tendencies with DNA pulled from the Air Max archives. Herringbone traction, mid-foot lock-down, and breathable mesh supply the grip, comfort, and ventilation that Ishod (and all skaters) require in their footwear. Those principles will likely return for the Ishod 2, but it’s really the off-the-deck lifestyle versatility that should have fans of skate culture interested. Starting off, the SB Ishod 2 boasts a visible Air Max unit — a detail scarce in Nike’s skateboarding footwear. With the off-colored sole beneath the Air unit, the Ishod 2 appears to be a nod to the Air 180 unit seen in identically named running shoe as well as the Air Force 180. The midsole that houses the Air unit features more bulk than the preceding model, rising even higher into the upper. Serendipitously, Wair contains the technology that supports the shoe. His last name is embroidered in familiar type on the lace collar, while his first is placed on the lateral side of the padded tongue. On the insole is a new graphic heavily inspired by Air Max iconography of the 1990s. According to Olympia Skateshop, the red and navy pairs set to arrive at skateshops on January 19th, 2024. A SNKRS release date has yet to be revealed.
