    "text": "- VeChain (VET) has recovered above the crucial $0.03 support level, displaying a bullish “golden cross” pattern on its two-day chart, indicating potential for upward momentum. - A previous golden cross in June 2020 led to a 3,062% increase in VET’s price, with analysis suggesting a similar trend could see VET reach $1.14 by October 2024. - Short-term predictions include resistance at $0.035, with subsequent targets at $0.038 and $0.04, while a fall below $0.03 could lead to a decline towards $0.024. VeChain, known for its enterprise-level blockchain solutions, is making waves in the crypto market with its recent price stabilization. The token VET is showing signs of a significant turnaround, catching the eye of analysts and investors alike. Golden Cross Signals VeChain’s Bullish Momentum - VeChain’s price has found solid ground above the $0.03 support level. - The appearance of a “golden cross” on the two-day chart points to potential bullish momentum. - This technical indicator has previously led to substantial gains for VET. Could VeChain Soar to $1.14 by 2024? - Crypto analyst AJ suggests a possible surge to $1.14 if patterns repeat. - Historically, VeChain saw over 3000% increase following a golden cross in 2020. - While history is not a predictor, the golden cross remains a positive sign for investors. Short-Term Targets and Resistance Levels - VET’s immediate resistance lies at $0.035, with further goals at $0.038 and $0.04. - Analyst Teshkid emphasizes the importance of the $0.03 support holding firm. - A drop below this level could see the price fall towards the $0.024 mark. VeChain’s recent performance and the technical patterns emerging on its charts present a beacon of hope for those bullish on the project. Despite the unpredictability of altcoins, the golden cross and recovery from recent lows could be setting the stage for a brighter 2024 for VET.",
