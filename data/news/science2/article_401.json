    "text": "—\nFollowing the announcement, Pacific ClearVision Institute can address astigmatism, nearsightedness, and farsightedness. The procedure is performed in just 25 minutes - and is currently the most popular vision correction option.\nMore information can be found at\nhttps://pcvi.com/treatments-eugene/lasik\nRecent surveys conducted by the NIH showed that minimally invasive procedures such as LASIK lead to greater patient satisfaction when compared to contact lenses.\n“Studies continue to show that laser eye surgery is safe and in many ways a more rational alternative to contact lenses,” explains a doctor for the practice. “The fact that it is the most common method of treatment of refractive issues is not just a function of its safety but its convenience to the patient.”\nPacific ClearVision Institute’s ophthalmologists explain that laser technology can effectively treat many forms of refractive errors in the eye. For example, LASIK can be beneficial for patients suffering from low, moderate, and high myopia with or without astigmatism. During the procedure, a laser is used to reshape the cornea and correct the refraction problems. In the majority of cases, this correction lasts for a lifetime.\nA full eye examination is necessary before the procedure - and it may include a slit-lamp exam, dry eye evaluation, and other types of tests.\nBesides the well-known benefits of laser surgery, such as immediate vision correction, continued advances in laser technology also mean that the procedure is becoming safer and more effective.\nAbout Pacific ClearVision Institute\nBased in Eugene, Oregon, Pacific ClearVision Institute employs ophthalmologists and laser surgeons with decades of experience in treating refractive errors, cataracts, and other illnesses of the eye. The practice also has an office in Cottage Cove for post-operative care and refractive surgery evaluations.\nA satisfied patient said: “ClearVision’s team really took the time to thoroughly examine and evaluate my eyes prior to discussing my options. They presented them including the risks and benefits of each. Their approach set me at ease. I am very happy with my results and follow-up. I just wish I’d done it sooner.”\nInterested parties can find out more at\nhttps://pcvi.com/treatments-eugene/lasik\nContact Info:\nName: Jessica Singleton\nEmail:\nSend Email\nOrganization: Pacific ClearVision Institute\nAddress: 1125 Darlene Lane Suite 100, Eugene, OR 97401, United States\nPhone: +1-541-343-5000\nWebsite:\nhttps://pcvi.com/\nRelease ID: 89118015",
