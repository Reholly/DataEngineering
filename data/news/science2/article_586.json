    "text": "I Tried to Grow My Email List With A Platform Nobody’s Talking About. Here Are The Results. Is this a new hidden gem to build your list quickly? Last month, I tested a new platform to grow my list. This platform is called Refind. Shockingly, nobody’s really talking about it. At first sight, it seems like a hidden gem where you can get legit email subscribers for less than $1.23. But since I didn’t know whether it was worth it or not, I decided to run an experiment. 23 days later, I ended up with 579 fresh email subscribers. But… was it really worth it? The ugly truth of organic growth I see many creators brag about how to grow their list without spending a single dime on ads. This sounds cool. But they never tell you what’s really happening behind the curtain. Growing a responsive email list is hard and VERY expensive. You’ll have to pay the price either with: - your precious time - your hard-earned money - and sometimes… even both! Organic growth ain’t free. There are many marketing bada**es like [Mike Dillard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-iIeZ86DAc) who were able to grow multimillion-dollar businesses out of paid ads. They’re not necessarily evil. It’s all about the strategy. (More on that later.) Does that mean that I am not growing organically? Absolutely not. I’m growing my email list organically using: - SEO - Medium - and YouTube They all work fine. However, I’m a growth junkie. So I don’t have any issues spending some of the green stuff if I know that I can make it back and grow faster. One of the ways to grow your list is by running ads. You could either sponsor newsletters or run ads on other platforms. I’ve been sponsoring a few newsletters in the past few months, and some did perform well. Others didn’t.",
