    "text": "Intellias Partners with Blackberry to Leverage the Power of the Blackberry IVY Platform January 05, 2024 at 12:10 pm EST Share Intellias announced a technology partnership with BlackBerry Limited. Under the new partnership, Intellias will become a domain expert for integrating the BlackBerry IVY® connected vehicle data platform into its clients' automotive reference designs, enabling the rapid creation of exceptional in-vehicle experiences for consumers and enterprises alike. BlackBerry IVY is hardware agnostic, based on industry standards and provides ready-made software development kits (SDKs) and application programming interfaces (APIs) for simple services integration at the vehicle edge.\nBy integrating and using IVY?, Intellias will be able to streamline the software development and testing process for its clients. Coupling this with integration tools and easy-to-use operational workflows, Intellias will be able to deliver cutting-edge customer software solutions, keeping pace with the evolving mobility landscape. The first step of the collaboration is to integrate BlackBerry IVY into the new version of the Intellias Automotive Portable Kit (IntelliKit 2.0), a fully functional digital cockpit prototype that showcases the seamless integration of diverse hardware and software components using modern frameworks and tools.\nThe latest IntelliKit 2.0 is based on Qualcomm SA8295P 4th generation Snapdragon Automotive Cockpit Platform with integration of Rightware's Kanzi One HMI kit and BlackBerry IVY connected vehicle data platform. Integration with the BlackBerry IVY platform and application of its abstraction levels enable Intellias to use a wide range of hardware and frameworks in IntelliKit 2.0. All updates and improvements could be performed without rewriting core programs or any significant changes in the architecture IVY functionality, which enables simplified, flexible, and future-proof integration with a wide range of hardware and third-party tools. Intellias values the opportunity to become a core part of the BlackBerry partner ecosystem.\nApplication of the BlackBerry IVY platform will enable Intellias to provide up-to-date services to automakers and Tier 1 suppliers by harnessing the power of vehicle data. By utilizing the Connected Vehicle Systems Alliance (COVESA) vehicle signal specification (VSS) data standardization model already widely adopted by OEMs, BlackBerry IVY optimizes data processing across diverse in-vehicle systems at the vehicle edge. This results in faster and more effective innovation, creating new data-based services for automotive and mobility clients, reducing operational costs of development, and introducing new business models.\nThis partnership is a crucial step for Intellias in creating cutting-edge solutions for connected vehicles and autonomous driving. In January 2024, Intellias will present its all-new version of the IntelliKit 2.0 at CES 2024 featuring Qualcomm hardware and powered by innovative technologies from partners: the BlackBerry IVY connected vehicle data platform and Rightware with their Kanzi One HMI all-in-one toolchain. Starting with the integration of the BlackBerry IVY platform into IntelliKit 2.0, Intellias plans to use the full capabilities of edge computing that allow minimizing data transfer to the cloud.\nIn the future, Intellias will utilize BlackBerry IVY in industry-wide use cases for comfort and infotainment systems, in-vehicle security and ADAS feature development.\nShare © S&P Capital IQ - 2024",
