    "text": "Using your tongue to control a computer mouse is certainly unconventional. But a San Francisco startup is developing the concept to help people with physical disabilities access today’s PCs and mobile devices.\nOn Friday, Augmental gave its first public demo of the unique mouse, which is called the MouthPad. The Bluetooth device essentially functions as a trackpad built into a mouth piece.\nIn the demo, Augmental software engineer Corbin Halliwill places the device against the roof of his mouth. He then uses his tongue like a finger on a trackpad, which allows him to remotely control a cursor on his iPhone, make clicks, and navigate to Google Maps, hands-free.\nBy using the MouthPad, Halliwill is also able to access the iPhone’s virtual keyboard and begin typing. He then searches for a nearby grocery store in Google Maps .\nAugmental initially debuted the concept in April with a separate video that showed the MouthPad has the potential to help people suffering from quadriplegia access their devices. Although many consumer electronics offer voice commands, it can still be hard to work efficiently on a computer without a way to interface with a traditional mouse and keyboard.\nThe MouthPad aims to fill the gap. The device can run for 5 hours on a single charge, and supports iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and Linux.\nOne challenge will be making the MouthPad fit different mouth shapes. For now, the company has been creating custom molds for customers by mailing them a kit designed to take their dental impressions. \"With your dental scan, we'll manufacture your custom MouthPad, ensuring maximum comfort and reduced weight,” the company said in a FAQ .\nAugmental plans on showing the MouthPad during next week’s CES in Las Vegas. The company’s website has also opened a waitlist for users interested in ordering a unit, although pricing isn't mentioned.",
