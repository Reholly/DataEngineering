    "text": "One analyst has explained that the outlook for Bitcoin should remain bullish as long as the cryptocurrency's price remains above this level. Bitcoin enjoys strong on-chain support above $41,800 in a new [Post](https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1743011866803151250) On X, analyst Ali talked about various BTC support and resistance levels from an on-chain perspective. In on-chain analysis, the strength of any support or resistance level depends on the amount of Bitcoin that investors have purchased at said level. The chart below shows what the distribution of different BTC price ranges based on holder costs currently looks like. What the different price ranges look like in terms of support and resistance near the current spot price. Source: [@ali_charts on X](https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1743011866803151250/photo/1) As shown in the graph above, the $41,800 to $43,100 range hosts the most Bitcoin acquisition value out of all the price ranges listed. To be more specific, approximately 2.4 million addresses within this range received 1 million BTC. Cost basis is naturally of utmost importance for any investor, as retesting the spot price can reverse their profit-loss position. In such a situation, when such a re-testing occurs, the possibility of holders taking some action increases. Holders who were in profit before retesting may buy more when retesting occurs, as they may believe that the same level that previously proved profitable will do so again. On the other hand, loss holders may want to sell at their break-even level as they may fear the cryptocurrency going down again, leaving them in the water again. These buying and selling moves are not enough to move the market when only a few investors are doing so, but if a large number of investors have their cost base in a narrow range, the reaction can be significant. As the range above $41,800 to $43,100 is dense among investors, this should be an essential on-chain range. The spot price is floating above the range so that these prices can act as a support barrier for the asset. Based on this, Ali explains, “As long as Bitcoin maintains its position above $41,800, the outlook remains bullish.” The chart shows that Bitcoin's price ranges above are not based on cost for so many investors. This could mean that there is not much resistance ahead for the coin. The analyst says that this lack of key resistance also strengthens the cryptocurrency’s ability to hold on to current levels or move towards higher levels. btc price Bitcoin is slowly making its way back after the recent crash, with its price climbing to the $43,800 mark.
