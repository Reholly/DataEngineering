    "text": "A 2023 study published in Journal of Happiness Studies found that “strengths scanning” or recognizing a partner's character strengths, such as their bravery, creativity, open-mindedness or kindness, can improve the quality and happiness experienced in a romantic relationship.\nStrengths scanning involves trusting the best in a partner and focusing on what they do right rather than waiting for them to do something wrong. Researchers suggest that actively acknowledging and appreciating these strengths goes a long way in maintaining a healthy, long-term bond.\nHere are two ways strengths scanning helps you bring out the best in your relationship.\n1. It promotes positive illusion in the relationship\nPositive illusions in a relationship refer to seeing your partner in an overly positive light, often more positively than you see yourself, and emphasizing their strengths, qualities, and admirable characteristics while maintaining a positive bias toward the idea of a successful future with them. have to give.\nThese positive illusions are generally considered healthy for relationships because they contribute to increased satisfaction and lower levels of conflict by promoting a more favorable attitude toward one's partner and the relationship as a whole. However, a balance between these positive illusions and a realistic understanding of one's partner can co-exist and is necessary to keep relationships fulfilling.\nExamining a partner's strengths in everyday interactions can reinforce these realistic positive illusions of their character. For example, when your partner talks about their workday, you may notice that they maintain great work-life boundaries, even when they have a heavy workload. “Scanning” their powers would mean reflecting on what it is about their character or their abilities that allows them to do so. This reflection can promote the realistic and positive illusion that they are highly organized, assertive, and confident.\nAccording to a 2019 study, positive illusions provide a sense of security and a willingness to invest in the relationship, helping partners deal with relationship challenges and treat each other's shortcomings with more kindness and understanding. .\n2. It increases mutual happiness\nStrengths scanning benefits yourself, your partner, and the longevity of the relationship. Research shows that when a person's strengths are valued, they experience greater well-being. Incorporating higher levels of character strengths is also linked to greater marital satisfaction for both partners.\nAccording to a 2018 study, displaying a higher level of appreciation for a partner's strengths is linked to experiencing greater commitment, investment, and intimacy. This allows individuals to view their relationships as a place of personal growth, where they feel supported in achieving their life goals. On the other hand, focusing on the negative side of a partner's qualities, such as the tendency to spread oneself too thin when providing emotional support, is associated with lower relationship satisfaction.\nResearchers found that acknowledging a partner's strengths can shape their behavior and also allow them to experience better well-being and personal growth. This works to boost their confidence and self-worth, develop a culture of praise and provide them with feedback on which behaviors to continue or eliminate.\nStrengths scanning can also increase “partner perceived responsiveness”, which measures how understanding, validating, and supportive a partner is perceived to be, and significantly improve relationship satisfaction. Seeking out a partner's strengths can make a person more attuned to their level of responsiveness and caring behavior as well as make them more appreciative and supportive of their partners.\nHow to Use Strengths Scanning in a Relationship\nHere are three ways to start accepting a partner's strengths.\n- Engage in active observation. Pay attention to your partner's actions, behavior, and accomplishments in everyday scenarios and consider what these examples reveal about their character. For example, even a small moment like a colleague bringing you a cup of coffee before work demonstrates strength of character by being loving and considerate.\n- Express gratitude often. Verbalize your appreciation of their strengths. Celebrate their accomplishments, no matter how small. This shows appreciation of their efforts and abilities. A heartfelt “Thank you for doing that” or “You're amazing at that” can go a long way in reinforcing positive gestures.\n- Encourage their development. Support your partner in his/her personal growth and advancement efforts. Encouraging them to engage in efforts that build and showcase their strengths is the key to creating a positive cycle of strength scanning and genuine praise.\nconclusion\nWhen both partners actively highlight each other's strengths, it creates an environment where each person feels seen and celebrated. Recognizing and accepting a partner's strengths strengthens the foundation of the relationship, fostering a deeper, more loving connection, effective communication, and mutual growth.\nIf you're curious to know your current level of relationship satisfaction, take this test: relationship satisfaction scale\nSource: www.forbes.com",
