    "text": "2024-01-05 16:59:26\nA major specialist in mini PCs, Minisforum is launching into a new market with its V3, an astonishing hybrid Windows computer that can act as a touchscreen tablet and external screen, powered by a powerful AMD processor.\nMini PC manufacturers seem in better shape than ever. It must be said that the growing success of their miniature computers, increasingly appreciated by users, gives them wings by pushing them to innovate. And if some seek to expand their catalog with gaming-oriented PCs, like Geekom with its attractive Mini FUN series, others do not hesitate to launch into new markets with astonishing products. This is the case of Minisforum, a major specialist in mini PCs, which will market its V3 in a few weeks, a curious device serving as a laptop, touch tablet and external screen. And the least we can say is that this curious hybrid surprises with its technical characteristics combining many recent technologies.\n© Minisforum\nLike some Microsoft Surfaces, the V3 is first presented as a touchscreen tablet. But not as a simple Android model. First, because it runs under Windows 11. Secondly, because it is immediately high-end, with components worthy of a real laptop.\nThus, the V3 is equipped with a beautiful 14-inch diagonal screen in 16:10 format with QHD+ definition (2560 x 1600 pixels) and a refresh rate of 165 Hz (a detail that will especially appeal to gamers). If the technology used for the panel is not specified, everything suggests that it will be an IPS type model because the maximum brightness promised is 500 nits, which is more than correct compared to the screens of Current laptops (excluding Oled models). And Minisforum announces colorimetry corresponding to 100% of the DCI-P3 standard, which promises excellent color respect. Note that although it is obviously tactile, the screen can also be used with an active stylus compatible with Microsoft Pen Protocol 2.6, with 4096 pressure levels. The accessory can be magnetically attached to one of the sides of the V3, but Minisforum does not specify whether it will be supplied automatically.\n© Minisforum\nDespite its large screen, closer to a laptop than a tablet, the V3 remains quite compact and light with 31.8 cm in length, 21.4 cm in width and 9.8 mm in thickness for a weight of only 946g. And its aluminum and magnesium alloy chassis seems well made, with flat sides that give it the look of a giant iPad.\nBut the V3 surprises above all with its “engine”. Unlike Android tablets, which are equipped with ARM chips, it is in fact equipped with a latest generation AMD Ryzen 7 processor, in Zen 4 technology with 8 cores and 16 threads. And if Minisforum does not specify its exact reference, we can expect very good performance since it operates at 3.3 GHz (5.1 GHz in turbo mode) while integrating a Radeon 780M type graphics circuit; like the excellent Ryzen 7840HS which is now found in several mini PCs. Enough, a priori, to run all kinds of applications, even demanding ones, including demanding games.\n© Minisforum\nMinisforum V3: a PC-tablet hybrid that can serve as an auxiliary screen\nThat’s not all ! The V3 also includes DDR5 RAM (up to 32 GB) and an NVMe SSD (with a capacity of up to 2 TB), like a real PC. And it is also well equipped in terms of interfaces: because in addition to Wi-Fi6E and Bluetooth 5.3 for wireless communications, it has two USB-C sockets to the USB 4.0 standard for connecting all kinds of peripherals, charging the battery or even send a video signal to an external display. Better yet, a third USB-C port with the VLink standard serves as a video input (DisplayPort standard), which allows the V3 to be used as an auxiliary screen for another device (computer, smartphone, etc.). A very original function which gives it real versatility.\n© Minisforum\nFor the rest, the V3 displays typical characteristics of a mid-range tablet, with a stereo minijack socket for audio, four speakers for stereo sound reproduction, a 2 Mpx front camera for selfies and visios associated with a facial recognition system, a 5 Mpx rear camera for photos and videos, a switch equipped with a fingerprint sensor and various sensors. Nothing to say, it’s quite complete.\nIn terms of energy, the V3 has a 50 Wh battery, but Minisforum says nothing about autonomy, which should depend on use and the processor, which can consume 15 to 28 W depending on the power supply mode. selected. Cooling is provided by a copper heat pipe and two ultra-thin fans.\n© Minisforum\nFinal details, the V3 will be delivered with a detachable keyboard (for use in PC mode) and Windows 11 Pro pre-installed, like all Chinese mini PCs. Minisforum indicates availability during the first quarter of 2024, but does not give any price. Difficult to say if this astonishing hybrid device will keep all its promises and if it will meet its audience. But, on paper, it has many advantages to replace a laptop and a tablet while also serving as a secondary screen if necessary. Above all, its Ryzen 7 processor opens the door to a wide range of applications, including in the field of gaming. So be patient.\n1704503514\n#astonishing #PCWindows #tablet #hybrid #doped #Ryzen",
