These technologies can help you reach a range of goals such as losing weight, lowering your stress level, sleeping better, boosting your immunity, elevating your mood, or improving your nutrition.\nIt's not an exaggeration to say these technologies can be a true blessing.

But with so many options to choose from, it can be tough to find what works, and that's where we come in. Our mission is to help you make the most informed buying decisions, which is why we exhaustively test every product and analyze its strengths, weaknesses, and value compared with the competition.\nAs a yoga teacher and PCMag's fitness expert, I get to review all the latest smart health technologies, and some of the recent innovations I’ve seen are truly impressive. But not every product is a winner, and not every good product is the right fit for everyone.\nIn this story, we highlight some of the best health and fitness products and software you can use right now, as well as explore some of the more promising technologies on the horizon.
