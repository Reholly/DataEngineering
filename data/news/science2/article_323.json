    "text": "—ORLADEYO preliminary 2023 full year net revenue of $325 million (+29 percent y-o-y)—\n—ORLADEYO net revenue expected to be between $380-$400 million in 2024, on trajectory for\n$1 billion in peak sales—\n—Operating expenses expected to remain flat ($365-$375 million) in 2024—\n—Company expects operating profit in 2024, approaching positive EPS and positive cash flow in 2H 2025—\nRESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C., Jan. 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: BCRX) today announced preliminary, unaudited ORLADEYO® (berotralstat) net revenue for the fourth quarter and full year 2023. The company also provided guidance for full year 2024 ORLADEYO net revenue, full year 2024 operating expenses, expected peak ORLADEYO sales and an accelerated path to profitability.\n“After three years on the market, ORLADEYO continues on a steady growth trajectory to achieve $1 billion at peak. This commercial success, alongside our proven discovery platform that is producing additional first-in-class or best-in-class molecules, uniquely positions BioCryst to achieve financial independence from the capital markets and accelerate our path to profitability,” said Jon Stonehouse, president and chief executive officer of BioCryst.\nThe company also announced that, if its ongoing proof-of-concept trial produces best-in-class data, it plans to out-license late-stage development and commercialization of BCX10013, its potential once-daily, oral Factor D inhibitor, to a partner that can drive the speed and breadth of investment required to accelerate BCX10013 for patients across multiple complement-mediated diseases and maximize the commercial potential of the program. As a result, the company has reduced the size of its R&D organization and accelerated its timeline to profitability.\nPreliminary Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 ORLADEYO Revenue and 2024 ORLADEYO Outlook\nPreliminary, unaudited ORLADEYO net revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $89.9 million (+27 percent y-o-y). Preliminary, unaudited ORLADEYO net revenue for full year 2023 was $325 million (+29 percent y-o-y).\nThe company expects full year 2024 global net ORLADEYO revenue to be between $380 million and $400 million. The general pattern of revenue throughout 2024 is expected to be similar to past years, with the seasonal impact of prescription reauthorizations and the potential impact of the Inflation Reduction Act in the first quarter driving a quarter-over-quarter revenue decline in the first quarter, followed by a strong return to growth in the second quarter.\n“ORLADEYO growth remained strong in the fourth quarter of 2023 as hereditary angioedema patients gain the excellent attack control they expect. Comparing U.S. patient trends year over year (y-o-y), we had more new patient prescriptions and a lower average rate of monthly discontinuations in 2023 compared to 2022. U.S. performance combined with continued global expansion keep ORLADEYO on track for $1 billion in peak sales,” said Charlie Gayer, chief commercial officer of BioCryst.\nOperating Expense and Profitability Outlook\nThe company expects full year 2024 operating expenses to be between $365 million and $375 million, flat to expected full year 2023 operating expenses. The company now expects that R&D expenses in 2024 will be reduced by $20 million versus 2023. This represents a $45 million to $55 million reduction from the 2024 R&D expense guidance it provided at its R&D Day in November 2023, and reflects both the R&D restructuring and the postponement of previously planned capital expenditures at its Discovery Center in Alabama. SG&A expenses are expected to increase by $20 million in 2024, primarily to support the continued U.S. and global growth of ORLADEYO to $1 billion in peak sales.\nThis operating expense outlook does not reflect non-cash stock compensation expense, or one-time expenses related to the reduction of 59 jobs (10 percent of total organization) in the first quarter of 2024.\nBased on the company’s disciplined approach to capital allocation, and the revenue expected from ORLADEYO, the company expects to achieve a full-year operating profit in 2024 (not including non-cash stock compensation), be approaching quarterly positive earnings per share (EPS) and positive cash flow in the second half of 2025 (not including non-cash stock compensation), and be profitable on an EPS basis, with positive cash flow, for full year 2026. The company expects it can achieve these financial milestones without raising additional funds and does not intend to draw the additional $150 million of debt available to it from Pharmakon.\nPresentation Tuesday at 42nd Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference\nOn Tuesday, January 9, 2024 at 6:00 p.m. ET, the company will present at the 42nd Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco.
