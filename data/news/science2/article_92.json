    "text": "A diagnosis of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) sounds like the end of the road.\nFortunately, it’s not.\n“Depression, even if it proves to be stubborn, is a very treatable condition,” says psychiatrist and psychotherapist Dr Mazda Adli, head of the affective disorders research division at Charité university hospital in Berlin, Germany.\nSo if your doctor says your depression is “treatment-resistant,” it doesn’t mean nothing more can be done for you.\nThe term is used when adequate dosages of at least two different antidepressants, administered for four to six weeks, don’t improve your symptoms.\n“It’s very important to make clear that ‘treatment-resistant’ doesn’t mean you aren’t treatable, but that your depression is simply refractory to treatment,” Dr Adli says.\nThis isn’t unusual, he says, noting that about one-third of patients with major depressive disorders don’t respond to initial treatment with two antidepressants.\n“Patients, their relatives, and also the doctors then need plenty of staying power and patience with treatment,” says Dr Adli.\nThere are many ways to help people with depression, he adds, even when medications – and perhaps a first go at psychotherapy – have little effect at the outset.\nShould standard treatment methods fail to improve a patient’s depression, doctors move on to a clearly specified step-by-step plan – and even look beyond it – until improvement is achieved.\nAlternative methods\nPossible options are set down in guidelines for the medicinal and psychotherapeutic treatment of depression.\nThey include electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS).\nECT involves a brief electrical stimulation of the brain, under general anaesthesia, that induces a cerebral seizure lasting about a minute.\nThis causes electrical and chemical changes in the brain. Psychotherapy or talk therapy refers to a variety of treatments that aim to help a person identify and change troubling emotions, thoughts and behaviours.\nIn rTMS, a magnetic coil placed against the patient’s scalp delivers magnetic pulses that stimulate brain areas that regulate mood.\nWhile both are proven methods of brain stimulation, less evidence has been gathered to date on the effectiveness of rTMS in improving TRD symptoms.\nDr Andrea Jungaberle, a Berlin-based clinical specialist in anaesthesia and emergency medicine, says it’s important that doctors and TRD patients together seek further treatment options.\nDr Jungaberle, who is also a psychedelic therapist researching on the therapeutic application of altered states of consciousness – including for depression, says many doctors, herself included, see substances previously known more as narcotics as giving new hope in treating depression.\nOne of them is esketamine.\nEsketamine is a more potent version of ketamine, an established anaesthetic that’s also used as a recreational drug (“special K” is one of its street names) and can have hallucinogenic effects.\nIn recent years, esketamine nasal spray has been approved in some places for short-term, emergency treatment of severe depression as well as TRD.\nDr Gerhard Gründer, a professor of psychiatry and director of the Department of Molecular Neuroimaging at the Central Institute of Mental Health (ZI) in Mannheim, Germany, heads a study on the antidepressant effects of psilocybin, a hallucinogenic substance obtained from certain types of (“magic”) mushrooms.\nTesting underway\nAt ZI and Charité, 144 TRD patients are being given psilocybin under the supervision of psychotherapists, who prepare them for the experience and then review it with them afterwards.\nAs Dr Gründer emphasises, the method is not comparable to a self-experiment with drugs: “Truffles containing psilocybin are legal in the Netherlands, where you can purchase them in shops,” he says.\n“But taking a substance like this is by no means a treatment, which must be well prepared and subsequently evaluated.”\nDr Adli, too, underscores the importance of taking hallucinogenic substances only under medical supervision.\n“After taking them, some people have dissociative experiences,” he says.\n“The feeling, for example, that they’re floating through the room, that colours or sound intensities change.\n“Some people don’t find this at all unpleasant. Others do. And some don’t notice anything at all.”\nAs Dr Gründer explains, clinical trials of alternative treatments such as this are aimed at determining their safety and effectiveness for possible approval by regulatory authorities.\n“The euphoria needs to be dampened a bit. In the media – in some articles anyway – psychedelics are touted as a panacea,” he says, pointing out that a large number of effective antidepressants are already available, however.\n“At the end of the day, psychedelics are simply a very practical – and probably promising – addition to our treatment arsenal.”\nWhen it comes to research on the use of psychedelic drugs for medical purposes, Germany, according to Dr Jungaberle, is an international laggard.\n“(Research) has been going on considerably longer in Switzerland, and there are studies in Great Britain, the Netherlands and Czech Republic,” she says.\n“Germany has now jumped on the bandwagon, but we’re about five to 10 years behind.”\nDr Adli, for his part, would embrace innovative treatments for depression.\n“We need to develop new antidepressants, and further develop existing ones,” he says.\n“Depression is a very common illness. A particular antidepressant won’t help everyone, and more treatment options mean greater treatability.”\nPsychotherapy is an integral part of treatment for stubborn cases of depression, he notes, adding that physical activity, a balanced circadian rhythm and learning self-care behaviour can enhance treatment effectiveness. – dpa\nOpen Modal ×",
