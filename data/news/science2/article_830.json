On January 6 at around 7:45 a.m. KST, PSY’s music video for his 2022 title track “That That”—which was produced by Suga in addition to featuring him as an artist—surpassed 500 million views on YouTube. The music video for “That That” was originally released on April 29, 2022 at 6 p.m. KST, meaning that it took the song just over 616 days and 13 hours to hit the 500 million mark. “That That” is now PSY’s fifth music video to surpass 500 million views (after “ [Gangnam Style](https://www.soompi.com/article/408548wpp/psy-releases-mv-for-gangnam-style),” “ [Gentleman](https://www.soompi.com/article/489260wpp/psy-releases-music-video-for-gentleman),” “ [Oppa is Just My Style](https://www.soompi.com/article/416335wpp/gangnam-style-hyuna-ver-mv-released),” and “ [Daddy](https://www.soompi.com/article/1405055wpp/psys-daddy-featuring-cl-becomes-his-3rd-mv-to-surpass-500-million-views)”) and Suga’s first solo music video to reach the milestone. Additionally, “That That” is only the seventh music video by a K-pop soloist ever to surpass 500 million views.
