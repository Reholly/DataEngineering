According to what Ansa writes, the king of rock will be brought back to life in “Elvis Evolution” and it will be life size; British company Layered Reality put together the show using artificial intelligence, holographic projections, augmented reality, live theater and multi-sensory effects to celebrate the singer’s life and legacy. It promises never-before-seen performances created through access to thousands of personal photos and home-video archives after striking a deal with Authentic Brands Group, owner of the artist’s rights. “A next-generation tribute to the musical legend that is Elvis Presley“Layered Reality CEO Andrew McGuinness explained. Presley, one of the artists who sold the most records in the history of musicdied at the age of 42 in his Graceland mansion in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1977. Elvis Evolution comes after the success of the show Abba Voyage, which transformed the Swedish supergroup into avatars, but also after the experiment with l artificial intelligence that gave new life to John Lennon’s voice in a posthumous Beatles song and to the film in preparation on the life of Edith Piaf whose voice will also be recreated by AI.
