    "text": "\nThe Wildlife Photography Challenge in GTA Online has quickly become a hit with the community after Rockstar recently added it as part of the latest update. But despite most players enjoying the task of photographing various animals throughout Los Santos, one critter continues to elude the pictorial grasp of every player: the Poodle. Luckily, a player has now found an unexpected method that will undoubtedly help you on your way to completing – and maybe even speedrunning – the challenge.\nOf course, if you prefer doing things the old-fashioned way, you may be better off learning all of the\nGTA Online Wildlife Photography Challenge locations instead. But if you want to tick the diminutive Poodle – or any of the other critters, for that matter – off your list, you’ll need to enlist the help of a friend and have them go on a brief Peyote trip. After they ingest the Peyote Plant, they will turn into an animal, which, according to a Reddit post, you can take a picture of, which will count towards the challenge.\nIt is worth keeping in mind, though, that finding all, let alone one, of the Peyote Plants is already challenging in and of itself, so you may have to help your friend out in locating the elusive herb. Once you do, however, you’ll be well on your way to completing the GTA Online Wildlife Photography Challenge without having to go through the trouble of locating each of the animals on the list.\nYou’ll also need to remember that the Wildlife Photography Challenge is only available on current-gen consoles, including the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, as mentioned in the latest\nGTA Online weekly update. This, unfortunately, means that those who play on the PC or previous-gen platforms won’t be able to access the picture-themed tasks. However, Rockstar Games could eventually introduce the challenge on different consoles, though this is merely speculation as of writing.\nWhile you wait for it to arrive on your preferred platform, check out our guides on the\nfive best drift cars in GTA Online and Grand Theft Auto 5 sales.",
