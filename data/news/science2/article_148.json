    "text": "We are getting closer and closer to the moment of truth Tekken 8the important project created by Bandai Namco. January 26th is around the corner and, while some online users accused Harada of racism towards the black community with Tekken 8, the majority of the community said they were enthusiastic about the demo of the upcoming title.\nToday, director Katsuhiro Harada wanted to comment on the general progress of Tekken 8 during the launch period of the trial version of the title, stating that “the Tekken 8 demoavailable now, got very positive feedback and pre-orders are constantly increasing”. Also in the same post, Harada declared that the final version of the project will resolve some of the problems encountered by users. There are no explicit references to what will be the subject of these changes, although it is reasonable to think that the director was referring to the accessibility option in Tekken 8 that caused migraines for many players.\nNonetheless, the Tekken community’s enthusiasm for the launch of the next chapter is more than palpable. There are about two weeks left until January 26, 2024, the day in which diehards of Bandai Namco’s fighting game brand will be able to get their hands on the definitive version of the game which will mark the beginning of the gaming year for the reference genre.",
