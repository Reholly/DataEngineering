    "text": "Any skill that can save you some HP when you’re in a challenging battle is worth your time, but how do you activate the Divine Blessing in Monster Hunter: World? Is it a game of chance, or something that requires a specific skill to nail every time? How To Activate Divine Blessing in Monster Hunter: World If you have Divine Blessing equipped, you don’t need to worry about hitting a button at the perfect moment, or anything like that. This isn’t Dark Souls, even if it feels like it sometimes. Divine Blessing has anywhere from a 25% to 40% chance of activating, depending on how many pieces of equipment have been blessed with this particular buff. The armor you create, especially at later levels, can be bestowed with the Divine Blessing perk. The more armor you wear with this particular perk, the more damage you may be able to absorb. You’ll find the amount of damage that you can withstand if Divine Blessing activates as follows: - 1 Equipment Piece – 15% Less Damage, 25% Chance to Activate - 2 Equipment Pieces – 30% Less Damage, 25% Chance to Activate - 3 Equipment Pieces – 50% Less Damage, 25% Chance to Activate - 4 Equipment Pieces – 60% Less Damage, 25% Chance to Activate - 5 Equipment Pieces – 60% Less Damage, 40% Chance to Activate So, while it’s a game of chance, it’s a surprisingly good chance to help you withstand some major damage. It can literally save your life, and doesn’t require any sort of button prompt, so hope that luck can take your side and lead you to the ultimate victory.
