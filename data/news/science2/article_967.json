    "text": "LONDON, United Kingdom — A new immersive Elvis Presley show will open in central London later this year, bringing the king of rock 'n' roll back to life with the help of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\"Elvis Evolution,\" featuring a life-size digital Elvis performing on stage, is designed to be the first of a series of shows in cities including Las Vegas, Tokyo, and Berlin.\nBritish company Layered Reality put together the spectacle using AI, holographic projections, augmented reality, live theater, and multi-sensory effects to celebrate the singer's life and legacy.\nIt promises previously unseen performances created through access to thousands of personal photos and home-video archive after striking a deal with Authentic Brands Group, which owns his estate.\nLayered Reality chief executive Andrew McGuinness called the show \"a next-generation tribute to the musical legend that is Elvis Presley.\"\n\"Elvis maintains superstar status globally and people around the world no longer want to sit there and passively receive entertainment — they want to be a part of it,\" he added.\nRelated: How The King entered and left the building: 'Elvis' movie review\nThe show, which is scheduled to open in November, will use music, technology, and storytelling to chart Elvis's rise to fame and his cultural significance to the 1950s and 1960s.\nMarc Rosen, head of entertainment at Authentic Brands Group, said it would give fans \"a new, immersive way of experiencing Elvis Presley's life and legacy.\"\nPresley — one of the best-selling music artists of all time — died aged 42 at his Graceland mansion in Memphis, Tennessee in 1977.\n\"Elvis Evolution\" comes after the success of Swedish supergroup ABBA's \"ABBA Voyage\" digital avatar show, which opened at a purpose-built venue in east London in May 2022.\nBloomberg reported in September last year that it has sold more than 1.5 million tickets, generating more than $150 million (P8.3 billion).\nRELATED: Take a chance on me: ABBA pass the torch on to avatars\nLisa Marie Presley death linked to weight loss surgery LIST: Music festivals that rocked the Philippines this year",
