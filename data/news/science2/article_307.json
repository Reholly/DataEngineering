    "text": "OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLA. (KOKH) â€” Three Oklahoma sites have been added to the National Register of Historic Places. According to the Oklahoma Historical Society, the properties are significant to the state's past. The first site is the John and Hazel Adams House located in Vinita. It was designed by architect Bruce Goff and built in 1961. The Oklahoma Historical Society says the house has twelve sides and was made with grey limestone and concrete. It also features recessed triangular windows in each corner. The Delaware School, District No. 64 located six miles north of Jay was also added to the list. It's a rural schoolhouse built of local limestone, according to the Oklahoma Historical Society. These types of buildings were reportedly common throughout the county and were used as schools and churches. However, the Oklahoma Historical Society says these buildings became increasingly rare as one and two-room schools became obsolete. This schoolhouse was originally a one-room school constructed in 1930. In 1935, an addition was built to accommodate the growing student population. After the 1962-63 school year, students who attended the Delaware School were sent to neighboring districts. The third site added to the National Register of Historic Places is the Dr. William A.T. and Lillian Robertson House in Ponca City. The Oklahoma Historical Society says the house is a significant example of a Dutch Colonial Revival style residence. It was constructed in 1907 and features a distinctive cross gambrel roof, along with Palladian windows. The house was reportedly influenced by architectural trends of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.",
