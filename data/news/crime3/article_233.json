    "text": "A miniature railway station in Bolton which was ruined by heartless vandals has been restored – but needs more volunteers to secure is future.\nThe site in the Moss Bank Park was wrecked with £20,000 of damage in June 2022.\nThe railway, which had been a mile in length but was reduced to just 20 feet .\nHowever following extensive work by volunteers and with the help of others it was able to reopen this year.\nStephen Rothwell, chairman of the Miniature Railway Moss Bank Park, explained how it they got going again .\nHe said: “We are back up and running, we were running for most of the summer.\n“We managed to replace all the track.\n“A local engine company supplied us with parts and the insurance paid out.\n“Four model engine places in Leyland, Southport, Clitheroe and Rochdale had open mornings for us.\n“It took a lot of effort, there was a lot of welding involved.\n“It took us six months to replace it.\n“It has been very popular, people were queuing up when we got going.”\nHe added: “It brings back so many memories to a lot of people.\n“‘We have had many parents and grandparents, they say 'I can remember coming with my mum and dad.’”\nThey now have a hydraulic turntable which helps raise and lower the trains onto the track.\nGoing forward they aim to set up a track with a three and a half inch gate in addition to the five inch one they have at present.\nThey also want to run a steam engine.\nBut he also said that more volunteers were needed if the railway is to survive going forward.\nHe said: “It is a big issue.\n“If we do not get more people helping it will close. We just do not have enough people around it.\n“We want other people to get involved. “We can train them\n“We are down to eight or nine people.”\nBusiness",
