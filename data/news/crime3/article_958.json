    "text": "2023-12-30 03:52:44\nVirginia Attorney General wins appeal in voter misinformation case\nby Ezra Hercyk\nFriday, Dec 29th 2023\nFILE PHOTO – Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares on Jan. 4, 2023. (7News)\nRICHMOND, Va. (WSET) —\nOn Friday, Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares announced that the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit rejected an appeal by Look Ahead America, Inc. This appeal related to Miyares’ legal action against the organization for false political mailers leading up to the 2023 General Elections.\nIn October, Miyares issued a cease and desist letter to Look Ahead America, Inc., also known as Virginia Voter Assistance, aiming to stop the circulation of “false and intimidating flyers” in northern Virginia. Look Ahead America, Inc. sued the Attorney General challenging Virginia’s voter intimidation statutes and seeking to restrain their enforcement. In October, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia ruled in favor of the Attorney General, denying Look Ahead America, Inc.’s requested injunction. The Fourth Circuit, on Wednesday, dismissed Look Ahead America, Inc.’s appeal against that denial.\nRead More\n“In Virginia, it should be easy to vote and hard to cheat. I’m proud of my Election Integrity Unit for taking action against voter misinformation and intimidation,” said Attorney General Miyares. “Look Ahead America, Inc’s election mail pieces threatened and misled voters, and I am committed to cracking down on intimidating, threatening, and coercive election tactics like this.”\nAccording to Miyares, Look Ahead America, Inc. distributed misleading flyers in Fauquier, Loudoun, and Prince William counties, alleging that recipients had failed to vote in recent elections. The flyers claimed that such non-participation could result in the loss of Social Security Income, Medicare eligibility, unemployment benefits, child tax credits, child custody rights, and concealed carry permits. These deceptive materials were falsely presented as coming from a governmental organization, lending an air of gravity and a fake appearance of credibility to their threats, according to the attorney general.\nThe Office of Attorney General Election Integrity Unit was established in 2022 as a restructuring of existing attorneys, investigators, and paralegals across the agency in order to increase collaboration and cooperation on election issues.\nLoad more…\n1703909349\n#Virginia #Attorney #General #wins #appeal #voter #misinformation #case",
