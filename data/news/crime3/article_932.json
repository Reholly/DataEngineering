    "text": "AHMEDABAD: The year 2023 has remained good for the Indian equity markets, especially with the market indices breaking new records several times in the second half of the year. The bull run and attractive primary market returns of the market lured several new investors to open their demat accounts and begin investing into their preferred stocks. According to data maintained by the National Stock Exchange (NSE), Gujarat added some 11.3 lakh new investors, and the state now ranks third across the country in terms of new investor additions. Gujarat lags Uttar Pradesh (23.12 lakh) and Maharashtra (21.79 lakh). 106392236Explaining the trend, Vaibhav Shah, the director of a city-based stock broking firm, said, \\\"The Indian equity markets have seen a bull run after the Covid pandemic, delivering handsome returns whereas most other traditional asset classes haven't augmented investors' wealth significantly. The Indian economy is growing strongly and projections are bright. Therefore, investor confidence in the performance of the Indian companies is rising, which has led to more new investors parking funds into the stock markets. Gujarat-based investors are known for their inclination towards the equity markets; however, other states too are witnessing quick increase in the number of investors.\\\"At a time when India saw a 22.4% rise in the total number of stock market investors to 8.49 crore, Gujarat saw a 17.2% rise.India added some 1.56 crore new investors in 2023 till December 25, suggests NSE. Viral Mehta, the west zone head of a stock broking firm, said, \\\"A major factor driving investor interest in the stock markets is the tech-savvy young investor base and several technology platforms including mobile apps that are enabling and even guiding young and new investors .\\\"",
