    "text": "Gypsy Rose Blanchard shares ‘first selfie of freedom’ hours after being released from prison Published | Last updated Featured Image Credit: YouTube / Instagram/@gypsyrose_a_blanchard Gypsy Rose Blanchard has posted her first selfie online since leaving prison. The 32-year-old was sentenced to ten years in prison for her role in the killing of her mother [Dee Dee Blanchard](https://www.unilad.com/news/crime/gypsy-rose-blanchard-dee-dee-regret-057168-20231227) in 2015. Now, after serving 85 percent of her [sentence](https://www.unilad.com/true-crime), she has since been released from jail and shared her first post-freedom snap. \"First selfie of freedom!\" she wrote on Instagram. [Blanchard](https://www.unilad.com/news/us-news/gypsy-rose-blanchard-released-prison-latest-727104-20231229) was sentenced to ten years in jail in 2016 after she and her [boyfriend](https://www.unilad.com/news/crime/gypsy-rose-boyfriend-nick-godejohn-sexual-fantasy-murder-555323-20231228) at the time, Nicholas Godejohn, carried out their plan to kill her mother, Dee Dee. It emerged that Dee Dee had been making it appear as though her daughter was terminally ill. This included making her use a wheelchair, shaving her head, and making her use medication she didn't need. Since being released, [ Blanchard has spoken about the future following her early release from jail](https://www.unilad.com/news/us-news/gypsy-rose-blanchard-released-prison-latest-727104-20231229), including speaking about her husband Ryan Scott Anderson, 37, who she married while she was in [prison](https://www.unilad.com/crime). She told People: \"My husband Ryan has been an emotional backbone for the last three years. \"We met when the pandemic was really, really strong and I had a lot of emotional ups and downs because of Covid.\" She added: \"Ryan has seen me through some really good times, some really hard times. \"I would say that he is probably the most compassionate soul that I've ever met, and the most patient. \"God knows, he's so patient with me, because I could be a lot to handle. I could be an emotional handful.\" Blanchard is now starting afresh, some seven years after she was sentenced for her role in the [killing](https://www.unilad.com/murder) of her mother. She said: \"We're in love. It's hard because I'm going into a new life and I'm newly married, and I'm going to have kids one day, and I'm going to have to explain to my kids why their grandmother on mommy's side isn't around. \"And that's going to be a really hard conversation.\" Blanchard said she feels optimistic about [the future](https://www.unilad.com/news/us-news/gypsy-rose-blanchard-release-taylor-swift-818833-20231223) as a new chapter of her life begins. She added: \"I don't foresee any major hardships. I think this, being in prison, has been the hard part. \"I think when I'm at home with my family, with my husband's arms around me and I'm surrounded by my loved ones, that is when I will be happy.\"",
