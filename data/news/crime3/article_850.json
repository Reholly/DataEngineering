    "text": "BALTIMORE (WBFF) — In just a matter of days, and for the first time in nearly a decade, Baltimore will finish 2023 with less than 300 homicides. Homicides are down about 20% and non-fatal shootings are down about 8% compared to this time last year, the latest statistics show. Still, at least 259 people have been killed, with their families forever impacted. During a recent prayer walk, Baltimore Police Commissioner Richard Worley acknowledged the city will soon break the yearly 300-homicide streak but said the current homicide numbers are nothing to celebrate. \"It’s a nice accomplishment. But still, today it’s 258 homicide victims, which is way too many for our city,” Worley said. The commissioner attributed the more than 20% reduction in homicides in part to enhanced partnerships with local, state and federal agencies. Mayor Brandon Scott, Baltimore City State’s Attorney Ivan Bates, and U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Erek Barron have stated similar reasons. “Our strategy has been focused. It's been aggressive. We're all on the same page,” Barron said. A year and a half ago, Barron announced new actions his office would take to address the violence. They included adding prosecutors, investigators and analysts to his office, reviewing firearms cases for violations of federal statutes and investigating repeat violent offenders while taking them off the streets by “any means necessary.\" Barron called the strategy an “Al Capone prosecution style.” The US Marshals Service says it also increased its number of operations this year. “Our operations have ramped up since the new U.S. attorney came in,” said Acting Marshal Mat Silverman. “We have always done our operations the way that we do our operations, and we’ve always left it open to the U.S. attorney to ask for assistance from the U.S. Marshals Service.\" All leaders admit there is still much work to be done. “The question is, 'Is this sustainable?' We've got to keep working as a team. Lamar Jackson doesn't do it alone, right? He's got 10 other players with him,” Barron said. Worley has focused on guns. He believes their easy access helps fuel violence in the city. The commissioner stressed consequences are key. “We still had too many robberies. We still had too many homicides and too many people getting shot. The biggest key I want to accomplish is getting these guns off the street. The proliferation of guns in our city is crazy,” Worley said.",
