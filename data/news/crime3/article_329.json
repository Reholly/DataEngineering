    "text": "Renters are set to be awarded more rights in 2024 as a major new law comes into force. And there could also be good news for areas struggling with soaring numbers of [ holidays lets](https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/property/), as ministers consider fresh rules. Most of 2024 new property rules form part of the government's levelling up programme which aims to improve housing stock and provide a better, fairer balance between the interests of tenants and landlords, reports [ MEN.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/uk-news/new-property-laws-coming-force-28329181) Most of these new rules form part of the government's levelling up programme which aims to improve housing stock and provide a better, fairer balance between the interests of tenants and landlords. In November this year, King Charles III delivered the first King's Speech in more than 70 years, with some new property bills announced. Amongst the bills, [King Charles](https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/king-charles-iii) referred to the two new laws that are set to improve the property market, the Leasehold and Freehold Bill and the Renters (Reform) Bill. He said: \"My Ministers will bring forward a bill to reform the housing market by making it cheaper and easier for leaseholders to purchase their freehold and tackling the exploitation of millions of homeowners through punitive service charges.

This means it will be introduced later in the year, but it's still good news for renters. It will see the end of a blanket ban on pets, so tenants will have the right to request a pet which landlords cannot unreasonably refuse. The bill will also make it illegal to have blanket bans on renting to tenants in receipt of benefits or with children – so no family is discriminated against. The government will also recognise that the student market is largely cyclical and that landlords must be able to guarantee possession each year for a new set of tenants. They will introduce a new ground for possession to facilitate this. And Landlords will also be handed stronger powers to evict anti-social tenants. Those who are persistently disruptive should be evicted – a measure that will be welcomed by both landlords and responsible tenants. The Bill will seek to halve the delay between a landlord serving notice for anti-social behaviour and eviction, with landlords able to make a claim in the court immediately. If a tenant breaches their tenancy agreement or damages the property, landlords will be able to evict them in as little as two weeks. The government say they will not commence the abolition of no fault evictions until stronger possession grounds and a new court process is in place. Proposed changes for holiday lets With a housing shortage in the UK, the government now appears to be focussing on short-term lets to balance the lack of housing against the benefits tourism brings. There are currently two new consultations on proposed changes to holiday lets, with the new changes anticipated to come into force in 2024. A registration scheme was available for property owners with holiday lets in England, who were asked to respond to a consultation by June 7, 2023. This was to help build a picture on the number and location of short-term lets to assess the impact on local communities. Proposals also include a new use class for short term lets, the potential for permitted development to change a dwelling to short term let and vice versa and potential flexibility for owners to let out as short term lets for a number of nights only. Responses are also being sought on whether planning would be needed if the number of letting nights is restricted and if so the number of letting nights available. Leasehold and Freehold Bill Currently, if your property is a leasehold, you own the house but not the building or land it sits on, which means you pay ground rent to the freeholder. The new law will see this form of homeownership banned, meaning anyone who buys a new home going forward will own the building as well as the land it sits on. The new Bill is set to improve homeownership for millions of leaseholders in England and Wales by making it cheaper and easier for more leaseholders to extend their lease, buy their freehold, and takeover management of their building. The new laws will increase the standard lease extension term from 90 years to 990 years for both houses and flats, with ground rent reduced to £0. This will ensure that leaseholders can enjoy secure, ground rent free ownership of their properties for years to come, without the hassle and expense of future lease extensions. It will also fully ban the creation of new leasehold houses so that, other than in exceptional circumstances, every new house in England and Wales will be freehold from the outset. The bill will also remove the requirement for a new leaseholder to have owned their house or flat for two years before they can benefit from these changes.",
