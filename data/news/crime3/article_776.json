    "text": "Topline After the pandemic brought historic spikes in murders, the U.S. is poised to finish the year with a historic drop in homicides and drops in other crime categories, a finding that conflicts with public perceptions that crime is on the rise, according to a recent analysis of criminal justice data.\nKey Facts Murders are down 12.8% over last year across more than 175 cities, according to criminal justice data analyzed by firm AH Analytics , with AH Analytics co-founder and data analyst Jeff Asher recently writing on Substack that the data suggests that U.S. murders are on pace to log “one of the fastest rates of decline ever recorded” this year.\nMajor cities, which some commentators have in recent years portrayed as overrun by crime, have seen significant declines in homicides, including double-digit declines in New York (11.42% as of Dec. 24), Los Angeles (15.45% as of Dec. 23) and Chicago (12.7% as of Dec. 27), per the AH Analytics murder dashboard, drawing from local law enforcement data across the country.\nRecently released preliminary third-quarter data from the FBI also shows that seven of eight categories of violent crimes and property crimes were down in cities of all sizes over the first three quarters of 2023—with the exception of car thefts.\nWhile it’s difficult to pinpoint exact causes for crime trends, U.S. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco told ABC News that she believed increased federal support to law enforcements targeting illegal guns has helped drive murders down, while other law enforcement officials across the country cited increased officer patrols.\nThe findings come as a recent Gallup poll shows that more than 77% of Americans believe that there is more crime than there was a year ago.\nKey Background Murder rates shot up in 2020 at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, rising 30% between 2019 and 2020— one of the largest single-year increases on record, though still below historic peaks in the ’90s. Experts, politicians and pundits have hotly debated the causes of that rise, citing everything from the economic fallout of the pandemic, community-police relationships after the death of George Floyd and subsequent protests and criminal justice reform policies. Still, the precise factors are complicated and difficult to pinpoint, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.\nCrucial Quote “The quarterly data shows violent crime down in big cities, small cities, suburban counties, and rural counties, pretty much across the board,” Asher wrote on Substack, citing the FBI data. “The decline in crime shown in the quarterly data — if realized — would be historically large.”\nTangent While the murder rate is down, mass shootings are up, with 2023 the second-worst year for mass shootings on record, according to the Gun Violence Archive.\nContra Some cities have seen increases in murders, including Washington D.C., which has seen an increase of 36.18% as of Dec. 27 and Dallas, which is up 14.69% as of Dec. 27, per AH Analytics’ dashboard.\nFurther Reading\nJames Farrell",
