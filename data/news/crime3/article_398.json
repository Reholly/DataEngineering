    "text": "The swearing-in ceremony for 100 special police officers, all contracted a week ago, took place on Friday at the Cyprus Police Academy. These special officers will undergo training at the police academy and at the motorised rapid action unit headquarter. Once they complete their training, they will be assigned to their respective service areas. Among other duties, the officers will be responsible for patrolling the Green Line, mainly to manage and address migratory flows. Additionally, their responsibilities will include checking irregular migrantsâ€™ movements to identify potential smugglers, guarding reception and detention centres, as well as deporting irregular migrants. The ceremony was attended by Police Chief Stelios Papatheodorou, the Deputy Chief of Administration and Training Christoforos Mavrommatis, the Police Academy Director First Sergeant Panayiotis Kountouresis, and by the Superintendent of the Alien and Immigration Service First Sergeant Thoma Hatdjikyriakou.
