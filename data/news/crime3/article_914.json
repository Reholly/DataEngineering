    "text": "By Andy Trigg & Pol Allingham for the BBC and PA Media\nTwo family members of a British backpacker murdered in New Zealand have been appointed OBE in the UK.\nGrace Millane, from Wickford, Essex, was strangled in an Auckland hotel in 2018 by a man she had met on a dating app.\nAfter her death, her mother Gillian and cousin Hannah O'Callaghan founded a charity called Love Grace, which aimed to \"empower victims of domestic abuse\".\nThey said it was an \"incredible honour\" to be named in the King's New Year Honours list.\n\"When the letters arrived we kept re-reading them as it was such a surprise,\" said Gillian Millane and Ms O'Callaghan, in a statement.\n\"We are so humbled that Love Grace has been acknowledged and would like to thank those who nominated us.\"\nSo far, the charity, which fills donated handbags with toiletries, has supported about 15,600 domestic abuse victims in the UK and across the world.\nGrace Millane was murdered in a hotel in Auckland on the eve of her 22nd birthday after she met a man via Tinder.\nThe body of the Lincoln University graduate, who had been on a gap year, was later found buried in a suitcase in a forested area outside the city.\nIn February 2020, her killer was\njailed for life with a minimum term of 17 years.\nAs well as its handbag appeal, the Love Grace charity also raises money for White Ribbon charities in the UK and New Zealand, which educate men and boys on attitudes that can contribute to violence against women and girls.\nMillane and O'Callaghan have been appointed Order of the British Empire for services to charitable fundraising and tackling violence against women.\n\"Thank you to everyone who has donated, and all of our friends and family who have helped us with Love Grace,\" they said.\n\"We would like to accept this award on their behalf and in Grace's name.\n\"We will continue to raise awareness of the issues many face, and make sure that no other family has to go through this,\" they added.\n- This story was first published by the\nBBC\nWhere to get help for domestic and sexual violence:\nVictim Support 0800 842 846\nRape Crisis 0800 88 33 00\nHELP Call 24/7 (Auckland): 09 623 1700, (Wellington): 04 801 6655 - push 0 at the menu Safe to talk: a 24/7 confidential helpline for survivors, support people and those with harmful sexual behaviour: 0800044334 Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP) 022 344 0496",
