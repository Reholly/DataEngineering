    "text": "Virtual Reality (VR) headsets are being purchased by [Derby City Council](https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-city-council) to help teenagers make the right decisions about carrying knives or joining gangs. A set of 16 headsets will be used in schools, after-school clubs, community settings and voluntary organisations. They have been funded by the Home Office’s Safer Streets 4 programme and immerse the viewers in one of two scenarios, related either to the issues caused by carrying a knife, or by getting involved in a gang, and giving them the chance to make decisions about what should happen next. There are potentially 3,000 different ways the scenarios could play out, showing that every action has a consequence. Both Virtual_Decisions videos were devised and created by Round Midnight, a Birmingham-based company. POLL: [Do you feel safe in Derby city centre?](https://xd.wayin.com/display/container/dc/1a54da20-2f61-4d33-81f4-14daa053426c/entry?mode=responsive&scrolling=no) Virtual_Decisions: GANGS explores gang culture, criminal exploitation and anti-social behaviour, and has been delivered to more than 2,500 young people across the UK. This success led to Virtual_Decisions: KNIVES, which features actors aged 13-18 to give added authenticity. Both sessions are accompanied by a creative arts workshop to explore the issues in more depth. The programme is now being rolled out to secondary schools in Derby. The VR workshops have been used around the country, with delivery led by police. This would be one of the first projects led by a local authority, in partnership with police. Councillor Hardyal Dhindsa, [city council ](https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-city-council)cabinet member for communities and Streetpride, said: \"When this administration took over in May, we were clear in our aim to reduce violence in the city. It’s vital we do all we can to keep young people safe in the city and empower them to make the best decisions. \"I’m delighted that we’ve been able to partner with Round Midnight to provide this unique, immersive learning experience. I look forward to seeing used in schools around the city.\" Claire Downes, chief executive of Round Midnight, added: \"All actions have consequences. And we understand that in the heat of the moment, making a difficult decision is not straight forward. We’ve made it easy for young people to explore all the outcomes with the guidance of the delivery team in Derby, so that if those situations occur in the real world, the young people will be informed enough to make the right choice.\" Since 2020, [Derby City Council](https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-city-council) has been awarded a total of £1.7 million from the Safer Street’s Fund, to invest in initiatives, which target neighbourhood crime, violence against women and girls, and anti-social behaviour, improving the safety of public spaces for all.",
