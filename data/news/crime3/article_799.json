    "text": "'Just glad she was alive': Relative relieved Fayetteville teen survived ordeal while trapped in Kentucky man's home\nA North Carolina teenager was rescued from underneath a trap door inside a home in Kentucky on Christmas.\nAccording to arrest records, authorities responded to a domestic violence situation at a home on the 1400 block of Robertstown Road in Lincoln County, Kentucky.\nWhen authorities arrived, a man identified as Zackary Jones, said that a woman had been in the home but left.\nAuthorities spoke with Jones’ mother, who made the initial call; she said the woman never left the property. Jones' mother, Ronda Jones, spoke with WRAL News and said she called authorities after argument between Jones and the teen.\n\"They were arguing, yelling and screaming,\" Rhonda Jones said. \"It's probably the hardest thing I had to do.\"\nDeputies took Jones into custody after he tried to destroy drug paraphernalia inside.\nAfter searching the home, authorities found the woman – later determined to be a teen who had been missing from Fayetteville -- underneath a trap door inside Jones’ bedroom.\nWRAL News is not identifying the teen in order to protect her privacy.\nA close relative of the teen spoke with WRAL News about the matter on Friday.\n\"I was scared,\" the relative said. \"I tried to warn her...what could happen to her and the worst possible thing could have happened you know? I'm just glad she was found alive.\"\nThe teen has since returned to Fayetteville to get help.\n\"She told me that the guy tried to kill her and strangled her and she got away from him and went to the mom's house and told the mom what happened,\" the relative added. \"She was looking for a getaway for a little while and it turned out to be a lot different. He moved. He lured her and then kept her against her will.\"\nRhonda Jones said she didn't know about the trap door or the drug paraphernalia because she \"never went up there.\"\nAfter he was read his rights, Jones admitted having lured the teen to leave her grandmother’s home in North Carolina.\nHe first told her he was 19.\nWhen the two met, Zackary Jones told the teen he was 25 after she asked why he looked older than his photos and took her to his residence in Kentucky.\nAuthorities said the teen learned Jones was actually 34 years old after speaking with his family. Jones' mother said the teen had been there for a few weeks.\nThe teen said Jones told her to say she was 18 years old, adding he was armed with a .22 caliber handgun and threatened to shoot and kill her multiple times.\n\"I asked him how old she was. He said, 'she's 19.' So, I took that as the truth,\" Jones' mother said. \"I believed him, because a lot of girls looked older than they are.\"\nRhonda Jones said she had no reason to think the teen was underage.\n\"To me, she willingly came with him,\" Ronda Jones said. \"I just feel like, they'd probably been talking. I don't know how long he's been texting her. From what the cops said that she was unhappy where she was at, and she felt like she was cared for and came with him.\"\nThe teen also told authorities that the pair was stopped for a traffic violation on the night Jones picked her up, and that he threatened to shoot the deputy if he were to ask either Jones or the teen to step out of the car.\nAuthorities said Zackary Jones admitted to having a sexual relationship with the victim on at least 10 different occasions after getting her high on marijuana and crack cocaine.\n\"I was shocked,\" Rhonda Jones said. \"I'm always upset when he lies to me.\"\nAccording to the police report, Jones also said the victim begged him to kill her.\nAuthorities in Kentucky charged Jones with multiple felonies, including sex with a minor, domestic assault of a minor, and false imprisonment.\n\"No matter what he had done, he's my son and I love him. I'm sorry he did it, and that's all I can say,\" Rhonda Jones said.\nThe citation said the teen’s grandmother plans on filing charges in North Carolina.\nWRAL News reached out to the teen's family, who declined to be interviewed. The family said they are glad the teen is safe, but she's traumatized and needs time to heal.\n•Credits\n[Liz McLaughlin](/rs/bio/20385293/) [Chris Lovingood](/rs/bio/19840836/) [Gilbert Baez](/rs/bio/13292930/) [John Rector](/rs/bio//) [Michael Joyner](/rs/bio/4279543/) [Joseph Ochoa](/rs/bio/20648349/) [Ryan Bisesi](/rs/bio/20211237/)",
