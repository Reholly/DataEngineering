    "text": "The recorded evidence is music to Jack Smith's ears.\nPro-Trump attorney Kenneth Chesebro was recorded discussing how miffed he is over being left holding the consequential bag and touched on the hasty efforts to allegedly secure fake electors' with paperwork in key battleground states in the wake of the incumbent president's 2020 election loss, according to\nCNN.\nThe material is something that former federal prosecutor Elliot Williams believes could add fuel to Smith's body of evidence against the 45th president in his criminal election subversion case.\n\"It's one thing for a jury to read a transcript or even hear someone talk about things they hurt somebody else day, it is another thing to hear voices to have sort of an evocative effect, that is more valuable and powerful,\" he said during an appearance on the network.\nALSO READ:\nTrump’s Iowa Faith Leader Coalition includes bigots, advocate of killing Obama\nThe\nTrump team is described by Chesebro as trying to deliver critical \"phony certificates\" to these supposed propped-up electors in multiple states and D.C.\nWilliams said that the furious attempts to move these ballots across state lines \"could be introduced as evidence showing the state mind of not just of the former president, or people around him who knew what they were doing and attempting to take all efforts to get these fake or alternate, their argument is, ballots to Washington, D.C.., it can speak to intent.\"\nChesebro, who pleaded guilty in October to felony conspiracy in Fulton County Georgia tied to the alternate electors' scheme, has been questioned by prosecutors investigating potential post-election crimes committed in other states including Michigan, Nevada, and Wisconsin.\n\"I don’t have a really warm feeling toward, at least, the top Trump lawyers that did this, hid from me what they were doing and then lied to Congress about me. So, it’s been really difficult,” he said in the recordings.\nChesebro resents being the scapegoat when he claims many others shunned him.\n\"I have the three top campaign lawyers in interviews with Congress claim they pulled out of this on Dec. 11 and I ran off and did it with Giuliani when in fact they were day-to-day coordinating the efforts of more than a dozen people with the GOP and with the Trump campaign.\"\n\"For them to basically say they had nothing to do with it and it's because of me and Giuliani that's what really rankles.\"",
