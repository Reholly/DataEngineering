(Larissa Beriswill – The Morning Journal) By Larissa Beriswill | lberiswill@morningjournal.com December 29, 2023 at 6:30 p.m. Two Grafton U.S. Postal Service employees are being recognized for aiding in the search and recovery of a Grafton woman’s diamond from her wedding ring.\nOn Dec. 19, the day after a heavy snowfall, Amy Hunt said she was running errands and delivered a piece of mail to the box outside of Sparkle Market on Main Street in Grafton, which had a slot instead of pull-down door.\n“I stuck my hand into the slot, and when I pulled my hand out, my ring clipped the top of the mailbox, and it broke one of my prongs,” Hunt said. “My diamond was gone.”\nThis was the original diamond Hunt said her husband had proposed with, which prompted her to look through the snow and ice on the ground for it.\nEventually, she saw postal carrier Mike Manuk, who helped her to look for the jewelry.\n“He went straight to the post office box, and I met him there,” Hunt said. “He opened it up for me, we looked inside the box through all of the mail and could not find it.”\nShe said Manuk contacted Larry Sadowski, the person responsible for emptying the mailbox to make sure he would be on the lookout as well.\nHunt went out of town for Christmas, and filed an insurance claim on her ring.\nBut, Sadowski used a high-powered flashlight Manuk provided and found the diamond outside the same mailbox, according to Hunt.\n“I guess it glistened in the ice, and that’s how he found it sitting outside of the post box,” she said. “I still couldn’t believe it.”\nHunt returned to Ohio and was reunited with her diamond.\nShe took it to a jeweler to ensure it was the same one that had broken off the four-pronged ring.\nHunt, who owns MBR Farm animal rescue , said both men have restored her faith in humanity, especially after her work with animals and seeing how “cruel people can be.”\nShe said she was surprised at the generosity of the men in helping a stranger.\n“He (Manuk) was so, super nice,” Hunt said. “He was delivering mail, he still had more mail to deliver and he just bypassed all of that and went to the post box.\n“It wasn’t even his job.”\nAccording to Hunt, she hasn’t met Sadowski, but knows about his efforts in searching for and finding her diamond.\n“He doesn’t know me, but he still went back multiple times to look for it,” she said. “I just think they’re amazing.”\nShare this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on X (Opens in new window) Most Popular Most Popular American Demolition tears down another abandoned building in Lorain American Demolition tears down another abandoned building in Lorain The Lucky Penny Café in LaGrange more than a coffee shop The Lucky Penny Café in LaGrange more than a coffee shop Lorain County Dog Kennel accepting donations for wish list items Lorain County Dog Kennel accepting donations for wish list items Monroeville man dies in Norwalk crash Monroeville man dies in Norwalk crash D and R Playland opens in Sheffield Village for youngsters to play indoors D and R Playland opens in Sheffield Village for youngsters to play indoors Lorain vs. Toledo Whitmer basketball: Whitmer shoots lights out to win Lorain vs. Toledo Whitmer basketball: Whitmer shoots lights out to win Browns defeat Jets, clinch playoff spot behind Joe Flacco’s three TD passes Browns defeat Jets, clinch playoff spot behind Joe Flacco’s three TD passes Avon vs. Brookside boys basketball: Eagles’ physicality outmatches neighboring Cardinals Avon vs. Brookside boys basketball: Eagles' physicality outmatches neighboring Cardinals Oberlin football: ‘Philosophical differences’ lead to Mark Campo resignation Oberlin football: 'Philosophical differences' lead to Mark Campo resignation North Ridgeville vs. Rocky River girls basketball: Grace Kingery’s 32 points key Rangers’ championship win North Ridgeville vs. Rocky River girls basketball: Grace Kingery's 32 points key Rangers' championship win Trending Nationally Housing is so expensive in Colorado that school districts are becoming landlords to attract teachers Disneyland chemical spill injures 2 employees Despite billions spent, new data shows almost a third of the nation’s homeless now live in California As cities take down Confederate memorials, Florida bill seeks to stop them — and put the statues back up Rose Parade 2024: Your ultimate guide for watching from home",
