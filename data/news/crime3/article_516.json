    "text": "Rex [From Pasadena Police Dept. Photo] Rex, the Pasadena Police K-9 who was injured on Christmas Day while assisting his human partners as they responded to a burglary call, is being called a hero by the Police Department. Posting on social media, Lt. Monica Cuellar of the Pasadena Police Department said Rex “played a pivotal role in ensuring officer safety.” His timely alerts also “enabled the apprehension of the suspect without further incident,” Cuellar wrote. “Rex not only shielded his human partners from harm but also facilitated the suspect’s capture unharmed,” Cuellar’s post said. The statement said Rex was with Officer Ryan Goetz at the time the call was received around noon on Dec. 25. Lt. Cuellar said officers responded swiftly to the reports of a burglary in progress inside a 99 Cent Only store on the 1700 block of East Colorado Blvd., and Officer Goetz and Rex were called in to help. “With Rex leading the way, officers entered the building, where the situation quickly escalated,” Cuellar said. “Rex, displaying remarkable vigilance, identified a specific area and, in the process, endured an onslaught of various items. Amidst the chaos, Rex sustained a cut on the left side of his snout.” Officer Goetz promptly evacuated Rex from the building and administered first aid. Rex was subsequently given immediate care at an emergency veterinarian, where it was found he had sustained a two-inch laceration after being struck, probably with a metal object, police said. Rex is two and a half years old and has been Goetz’ partner since February 2022, Cuellar said. “It’s important to recognize the time to ensure that K9 units are well-trained, disciplined, and under the control of their handlers,” the officer posted. “The bond formed between K9 officers and their four-legged partners often becomes a bridge for building trust and fostering a sense of community between law enforcement agencies and the people they serve.” Rex is anticipated to make a full recovery. Following the attack, the suspect, later identified as 25-year-old Jose Soto, surrendered to the authorities and was taken into custody without further injuries. Soto is facing charges of burglary and injury to a peace officer animal.",
