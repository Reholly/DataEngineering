    "text": "Car Dealership Ripped Off His Friend By Falsifying His Income, So He Gets The Dealer To Give His Friend A Car For Free\nby Matthew Gilligan\nIf you’ve ever gone through the process of buying a new\nor a used car from a dealership, you know how frustrating the whole experience can be.\nBut there are ways to deal with the shady car folks out there!\nAnd this person really nailed it.\nThey started their story by saying that they wanted to help out a friend…\nHow I got a car dealership to give my friend a “newer” car.\n“Circa January 2020 my friend makes a stupid decision and buys a brand new car he can’t afford.\nHis insurance is like $400 a month, he makes like $10.25 an hour working as a shift supervisor at McDonalds.\nHis car payment is like $795 a month.\nNow at $10.25 an hour, 30 hours a week that’s a weekly income of about $300 a week or about $1,230 a month….so yea.\nThey were trying their best to help out their friend.\nSo my friend came to me for help because I used to sell cars and know the industry pretty well.\nI go over his paperwork. The dealer did rip him off, but my friend is trying to find a way to get out of this mess.\nAnd ripping someone off isn’t illegal.\nThey did of course over charge him for warranty, they gave him a higher APR, they had add ons, etc…but none of that is illegal and I know the only way I can get my friend out of this deal is if they did something illegal.\nThey got an idea.\nSo I look at his finance application that my friend signed, it correctly listed his income.\nWhich turned a light bulb on in my head.\nNo bank is going to approve someone for a $795 car payment if they are only making $1,200 a month. It does not make mathematical sense to do that.\nSo I start searching through his paperwork for the finance app the dealer submitted to the bank.\nYou often times when you submit a finance application at a dealership the dealership will take the hand filled out application and reproduce it electronically.\nThis is pretty normal.\nA little white lie never hurt, right?\nHowever on the application the dealer submitted to the bank the dealer said my friend was a GM of the McDonalds and made $70,000.\nMy friend had good credit, so it doesn’t appear like the bank asked for proof of income.\nSo I go to the dealership with my friend and tell the sales manager he’s going want to put me in touch with the GM because we are going be unwinding my friends deal and giving his trade in back.\nThe sales manager thought I was joking, the GM also thought I was joking.\nThen I demonstrated how his dealership finance department committed bank fraud. I showed the GM the finance app my friend filled out. I then showed the GM the finance app his dealership submitted to the bank and pointed at the income difference. My friend really made $14k a year, the dealership claimed my friend made $70k a year. That’s bank fraud, that’s a felony, lets keep this simple shall we.\nThe GM sees his dealership is in a load of ****. The proof I am presenting to him is rock solid. He knows it, I know it, we are all on the same page.\nHe was ready to drop a bomb on the GM.\nHe goes “ok…so what can I do to make this right?”\nI go “Unwind the deal give me my friend his trade in back.”\nUnwinding the deal is basically the GM agreeing to cancel the deal, and basically erasing the deal and pretending it never happened.\nGM tries to avoid that but I remain firm and remind him we can take easily take this documentation and turn his life in a living hell. He knows i’m right. My friend also needs a car to get to work the next day.\nThe GM says he’ll check into it he comes back and tells me unfortunately they sold his trade in already. I said “That’s fine, unwind the deal and lets put my friend into something as good or slightly better then what he traded in for”\nAre you sure you really want to go there?\nSo the GM goes “So he’ll buy a car similar to his trade in?”\nI said “No, you’ll give him a car similar to his trade in.”\nThe GM goes “It doesn’t work that way.”\nI go “It does when you commit bank fraud.”\nGm is upset with me and I remind him…I’m being really nice and this situation can totally get really ugly. Like felony level charges ugly. Like losing your franchise ugly.\nSO yea this is going hurt…but it’s going hurt less my way.\nSo the GM goes alright and he looks in his inventory and he tells me they have a 2007 Focus with 10k more miles.\nI tell him “no, the car you give my friend needs to be the same or better then what he trade in.”\nThe GM counters “I’m giving him a free car.”\nI go “No, you took his trade in, you sold it, you made money on that sale, you also committed a felony in the process of selling him his new car. You are now correcting that mistake. This isn’t a free car for my friend. This is a you are correcting your mistake.”\nGM insists that’s what he’s willing to do I tell him if he can’t do better than that we will go to a consumer protection attorney and have a conversation with them.\nMy friend didn’t wanna go this route…but it was our plan B.\nWe get to get up, the GM says “Wait, give me a second.”\nThe GM goes “I have a ’08 civic, it has 5k more miles, but its a civic and not a focus. I unwind the deal on the new car, and put your friend in the civic at no extra cost.”\nWe agree.\nIt seemed like this was the best way to go…and they nailed it!\nGM has the paper drawn up, the old loan on the new car is canceled, they take in the new car again (but because it’s already titled they’ll have to sell it as used, that sucks for them).\nThey gave my friend a better car then the one he traded in.\nFor people asking why we didn’t get a lawyer involved from the start\nWe could have done that\nBut courts take a long time, and this was a faster way to fix the situation.”\nLet’s see what people had to say about this.\nThis person said they need to educate their friend about finances.\nAnother reader had a similar story to tell.\nThis Reddit user said they used to work in this industry…and they left.\nOne person shared a surprising fact.\nAnd this person shared a story about their friend…\nNice work!\nConsider us impressed!\nIf you enjoyed this story, check out this post about a\ndaughter who invited herself to her parent’s 40th anniversary vacation for all the wrong reasons.\nCategories:\nSTORIES\nTags: ·\nbusiness, buying cars, cars, customer service, money, picture, pro revenge, revenge, top",
