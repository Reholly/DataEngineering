    "text": "CONTRIBUTED CONTENT — If you’ve been injured in an accident or suffered an injury due to negligence, you need someone who will support you, stand by you and fight for you, because your case – and your future – matters. It’s time to call the experts at We Win Injury Law.\nThe\nWe Win Injury Law team of attorneys Tyler T. Todd, S. James Park, Jaren C. Sandberg and Troy A. Sundquist have been representing personal injury clients in Southern Utah for over 20 years. Together, they’ve helped recover more than $9 million for the victims of car, truck and motorcycle accidents, slips and falls, dog bites, premises liability, medical malpractice and wrongful death.\n“We’re the injury lawyers that get results for you,” Todd said. “We win for you. That’s what we do.”\nTodd has 18 years of experience as a personal injury attorney. Prior to establishing We Win Injury Law in the summer of 2022, he helped bring cutting-edge legal tech to Southern Utah as a partner in 1LAW.\nIn fact, We Win Injury Law still occupies the former 1LAW office near the intersection of Bluff Street and Black Ridge Drive in St. George. The firm has opened additional locations in Hurricane, Cedar City, and most recently, Orem.\nSouthern Utah is their home, but Todd and his partners have their sights set on statewide expansion. Ultimately, their goal is to make a name for themselves as the go-to injury lawyers for the entire Mountain West.\nBeing a personal injury attorney isn’t just about the money, Todd said. Of course, We Win Injury Law always strives to maximize the money because in the world of injury law, money equals justice. But when they’re cutting checks to their clients, they know that no amount of money can fully erase the injuries that individual has suffered or restore the precious time they’ve lost at home and at work.\n“We’re always asking ourselves what more we can do,” he added. “We have empathy, and we really try to put ourselves in our clients’ shoes. It’s everything we’re passionate about; it’s why we’re lawyers.”\nWe Win Injury Law isn’t the type of firm that takes on hundreds of cases to settle quickly for an easy payday. Todd and his partners are all first-chair trial lawyers who fight for the settlements and verdicts that their clients deserve.\nThey evaluate every client’s situation individually. Few cases are too big or too small, and they never charge a fee unless they successfully recover money on a client’s behalf.\nSuffering a serious injury can turn your life upside down. The last thing victims of an accident need to worry about is how they’ll pay for the medical treatment they need to get back on their feet. When you don’t know what to do or where to turn, We Win Injury Law will be there for you.\n“Our attorneys and staff are all in on your case,” Todd said. “We’re your team from the time you call us until we cut your check. Trust us to take care of you.”\nIf you’ve experienced serious injuries due to negligence or carelessness, We Win Injury Law will help you fight for justice and move forward with your life.
