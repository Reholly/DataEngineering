    "text": "\"During our darkest time, our community, law enforcement brotherhood, and local fire departments banded together and shined the light to guide our grieving members through the most challenging loss our agency has suffered,\" said the town of East Fishkill Police Department Acting Chief Lt. Derrick Cuccia in a letter to all.\nThe incident happened around 6 p.m., Monday, Dec. 18 on the Taconic State Parkway in East Fishkill.\nEast Fishkill Police Department officer Daniel P. DiDato, age 47, was traveling to Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla to continue an investigation with an accident victim when his vehicle ran off the road and hit a tree.\nHe was transported to MidHudson Regional Hospital in Poughkeepsie where he died from his injuries.\nDuring DiDato's funeral, Cuccia said: \"To see so many flag-waving members of our community lining the streets and saluting the funeral procession in a show of support reminds us how privileged we are to serve and that Sgt. Daniel DiDato did not die in vain.\n\"For 19 years, Sgt. DiDato proudly and faithfully served this community without hesitation and in return, our community came out to ensure his service was honored.\"\nHe also thanked all who turned out to support DiDato's family while paying their final respects.\n\"To the law enforcement brotherhood, Thank You. The countless letters, phone calls, and emails expressing concern, support, and encouragement proved to our department members they are not alone,\" he added. \"The assistance we received with planning and coordinating events allowed our members time to grieve.\"\nThe love and support the countless law enforcement agencies and PBAs have shown to our community has been an emotional lift to our members and the friends and family of Sgt. DiDato, the acting chief said.\nCuccia said while the police departments are too numerous to list, I would be remiss if I didn't mention those within our immediate community who responded in our hour of need:\n- New York State Police\n- Dutchess County Sheriff's Office\n- City of Poughkeepsie\n- Town of Poughkeepsie\n- Dutchess County Emergency Response\n- Town of Fishkill\n- Village of Fishkill\n- Village of Wappingers\n- Hyde Park\n- NYPD\n- Department of Environmental Protection\n- Westchester County Police\n- Putnam County Sheriff's Office\n- The City of Beacon.\n\"Thank you to the East Fishkill and surrounding fire departments for the spectacular flag displays along the funeral procession route,\" Cuccia said. \"We are all in this together and your contribution and show of support will never be forgotten.\"\n[Click here]\nto follow Daily Voice\nSouthwest Dutchess\nand receive free news updates.",
