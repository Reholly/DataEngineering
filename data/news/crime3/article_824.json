    "text": "My wish for 2024 is we implement somehow laws and policies that strengthen the principles of democracy in our state. In doing this, we can bring back some of the grandeur, ethics and legacy that fighting Bob La Follette brought to Wisconsin.\nThe state Supreme Court taking action to require that legislative and congressional maps be redrawn for the 2024 elections will be huge step forward in accomplishing a healthier state of democracy here. New nonpartisan maps aimed at erasing the damaging effects of gerrymandering should instill competitive races where winners will be less predictable. Incumbents will increasingly have to serve all of their constituents, instead of relying on their base of voters that keep them repetitively in office now.\nThe carryover of this monumental change in legislative and congressional districts should be renewed respect for all salient points of view. The presidential race in November should be held in the context of more competitive races statewide, thereby ensuring fair and impartial outcomes at all levels of government.\nPeople are also reading… UW-La Crosse chancellor fired after producing online porn Restaurant reviews: The 15 best-reviewed restaurants of 2023 in the Madison area 10 big housing projects that will change Madison in 2024 UW Board of Regents to hold special meeting to consider chancellor punishment Who are the 2 referees the Wisconsin Supreme Court named to review new maps? 5 ways Wisconsin's new alcohol laws could affect you Madison Edgewood boys basketball coach makes 'hard decision' to resign mid season Wake surfing bill will help protect Wisconsin's lakes — Andrew Aslesen 13 restaurants or bars in the Madison area that closed in 2023 Wisconsin Supreme Court overturns Republican-drawn legislative maps, orders new boundaries NBA puts New York lump of coal in Bucks' stockings Which areas of Madison are calling police the most?

In a democratic republic, citizens are the ones who call the shots and make the important decisions by putting into office elected officials who more closely represent their views. Are you ready to help make this happen?\nKen Berg, Watertown",
