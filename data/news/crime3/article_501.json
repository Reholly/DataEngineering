    "text": "Interior Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindiki announced on Friday that the government will introduce a programme where that will reward those who will lead to the arrest of sympathisers in banditry. While on a visit to Posta in Laikipia County, the CS stated that the programme said that officers and members of the public would give cash rewards to those who would help the government catch up with executors of banditry. The CS also revealed that the [ names and profiles of perpetrators in banditry](https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/93200-cs-kindiki-gives-shoot-kill-orders) will be made public in 2024 as the government intensifies its crackdown. ''Going forward, the Government through the Interior Ministry will run a program to financially reward gallant officers and members of the public whose efforts will result in the arrest of the key planners, executors and enablers of banditry whose profiles will be published countrywide in the new year,'' Kindiki stated. The CS also sounded a warning to criminal enterprises that are responsible for the deaths and displacement of people as a result of banditry. ''Cattle rustling in Northern Kenya has over the years become an organised criminal enterprise responsible for deaths, destitution and displacement,'' he stated. In his statement, Kindiki revealed that the government's main aim was to [dismantle and disable activities by banditry ](https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/86791-kindiki-kdf-back-drawing-board-bandits-devise-new-tactic)to make it impossible for them to carry out their plots. ''To dismantle the infrastructure of cattle rustlers and facilitators, the Government is sustaining the war on banditry and its perpetrators, enablers, benefactors and beneficiaries by making banditry a painful venture, ensuring recovery of stolen livestock and rewarding facilitators of recoveries,'' Kindiki added. The CS listed the government initiatives against banditry as he handed overheads of cattle that had been stolen and recovered in full. In the handover, CS Kindiki also rewarded local leaders and youth who worked with the government to ensure the cattle had been recovered. Since taking over the Interior Ministry from Fred Matiang'i, Kindiki has frequented bandit-prone areas to monitor progress as well as boost the morale of security officers deployed in the regions. Kindiki recently announced a plan by the government to place a bounty on bandit commanders as a new strategy to intensify their crackdown. - . . . .",
