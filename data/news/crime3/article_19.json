    "text": "Six months ago, the name “Gabe Gore” was largely unknown. Sure, the Detroit native has lived in the region off and on since the early 80s. He’d spent more than a decade building a promising career with several high-profile law firms, including most recently the powerful Dowd/Bennett firm. He served as the assistant U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri, assistant special counsel for the John C. Danforth Office of Special Counsel and was a member of the Ferguson Commission. However, his current position as head of the St. Louis Circuit Attorney’s Office (CAO) Gore’s name became prominent after Governor Mike Parson announced he had selected him to replace Kimberly M. Gardner, who quit the job on May 16, 2023. Gore describes himself as a “general litigator” who has served as a federal prosecutor and represented clients facing federal charges. “I think strategically about how to argue and present things to the court to the benefit of my clients. Today, the client may have changed but the strategies and how I present things haven’t. In this position, I serve our clients-the citizens of St. Louis-we go to the courts and represent them to the best of our ability.” Gore stepped into the unenviable position of replacing a prosecutor who was twice elected by voters but was loathed by many powerful individuals mostly for her positions on police reforms and her decision to prosecute former Governor Eric Greitens. With charges of incompetence, Gardner faced a barrage of media accusations ranging from in-office resignations to criminal case backlogs. At the time of her resignation, Attorney General, Andrew Bailey, was seeking to remove Gardner from office legally. Recently Gore delivered a progress report highlighting his job-related accomplishments which include the hiring of 24 attorneys with 120 years cumulative prosecutorial experience; reorganizing the CAO’s diversion programs: investing in employee compensation and training; community engagement and establishing a conviction integrity unit, led by retired Missouri Supreme Court Judge George W. Draper III. His efforts to address a backlog of cases is another accomplishment. According to a CAO press release, from June 1 to Dec. 1 of this year, the office has charged about 2,650 new cases, compared to 1,460 charged during the same period of 2022 – a 45 percent increase. In just six months Gore has received public praise for his CAO reformation efforts and prominent accolades such as Missouri State University’s 2023 “Government Excellence Award” and the St. Louis American’s “2023 Person of the Year” award. Gore shared how some friends responded to the news of his new position. “They’d say, ‘congratulations…I guess,’” the prosecutor chuckled. Accepting the role of the city’s chief prosecutor came with immediate challenges. “From Gardner’s resignation to the appointment process to closing my private practice (I had been at Dowd/Bennett for 13 years) in about a week and a half. All that to being sworn in while (simultaneously) preparing for this job…the sheer condensed nature of it all was extremely challenging.” Once he officially reported to work on the 4th floor of 1114 Market Street, Gore said he encountered an office that was “severely understaffed in every area you could imagine.” “The key resource in any law office is people and we didn’t have a lot of people,” Gore explained. “So, the biggest challenge was to get some leadership back, get some senior people to come in and help me run this office.” He said there were only 25 attorneys in the office with 22 of them focused on criminal cases. He added 24 more, saying that the office is at a point “where everyone’s working at 130% of capacity and we’re able to meet our obligations and effectively represent the citizens of St. Louis in the criminal courts.\" Still, Gore added, there’s much more work to do to make sure the office is “sustainable and back to full strength.” Asked how he’s holding up, Gore recited a quote someone shared with him when he took the CAO position: “‘One of life’s great blessings is to be given the opportunity to work hard on important work’ and as someone who’s always looking for an opportunity to serve, this is a great blessing,” Gore said. A discussion about the time he spent with former President Barack Obama at the University of Chicago Law School segued into the topic of unexpected outcomes. Gore took Obama’s “Race & Law” course and was impressed that he was one of the only professors who actively sought to play pick-up basketball with him and other students. After the games ended, Gore remembered Obama's invitation to stick around. “He’d say ‘Gabe, I’m trying to get in a good workout and you seem to be in good shape (he knew I ran track). So, we’d play one-on-one, sometimes full court,” Gore said, recalling Obama’s speed and his specialty “line drive, pull-up jump shot that he never seemed to miss.” Back then, Gore said he never imagined Obama going into politics, first as an Illinois senator and later as President of the United States. He and his fellow students predicted Obama’s future as a leading professor at the law school. “But, Gore said, “history indicated otherwise.” When Gore sat down with the St. Louis American in June, he said he was not focusing on running for the CAO position next year. Again, history seems to be indicating otherwise. Earlier this month, Gore announced that he’s running for a full, four-year term in 2024. “Running for public office is not something that has ever been on my career to-do list,” Gore said. “And that hasn't changed. But what has changed is the unique opportunity to serve alongside the men and women who have come back to the circuit attorney's office to join me to do the work that's necessary to have a positive impact on the community that I love. And to create a greater level of public safety for the entire region.” Gore said he believes voters next year will be cognizant of his efforts to revamp and revitalize the CAO in such a short time frame. “Across the board we’ve been successful in rebuilding things,” he said. On his selection as this newspaper’s “Person of the Year,” Donald M. Suggs, longtime owner and publisher of the American, credited the prosecutor’s accomplishments: “Gabe Gore has brought some much-needed administrative leadership to a beleaguered Circuit Attorney’s office,” Suggs said. “His stellar reputation and solid performance have enhanced his ability to attract some able, experienced lawyers who are an essential component to addressing the daunting challenges of an office that is critical in the criminal justice system.” Sylvester Brown Jr./Deaconess Foundation Community Advocacy Fellow.",
