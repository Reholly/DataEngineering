And they also had an AirTag.\"\nOnce her family's luggage was recovered, to their dismay, almost everything was gone.\n\"Police believe they may have sold the clothes for money, who knows,\" Catherine explained. \"These are my parents, coming to the mountains for a North Carolina view, so for this to happen made me sad, which was all the more reason to go after them…I wouldn’t have found them without this AirTag.\"\nCharlotte, N.C., city skyline.\nAccording to police records, the suspect was arrested and charged with multiple theft crimes, including a drug charge, and is being held on a $10,000 bond.\nThe Gastonia Police Department did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.\nOriginal article source: Florida family uses Apple AirTag to locate stolen luggage from a North Carolina airport to suspect's home\nView comments",
