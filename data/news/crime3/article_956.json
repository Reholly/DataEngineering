    "text": "Walton linebacker Ashton Woods said he always got nervous before games. He said he never wanted to get comfortable, because if he did, that’s when the opponent could, too. Well, it was obvious the pregame butterflies were flying all year this season. Woods led a defense that allowed only 16.5 points per game, went 14-1, had an undefeated regular season, won the Region 5 title and made it all the way to the state championship game. Woods himself finished the year with 152 tackles, 20 tackles for loss, eight sacks and two interceptions. He earned Region 5 Defensive Player of the Year honors, was named all-State by the Touchdown Club of Atlanta and Recruit Georgia and to cap it off, he is the All-Cobb County Defensive Player of the Year as selected by the Cobb County coaches. After averaging 15 tackles a game, it may be hard to imagine the gaudy numbers the North Carolina-signee may have put up if he had played in the second half of games. In at least eight games, he was off the field either at halftime, or early in the third quarter. It was in those early moments of the third quarters where Woods said he started hearing messages from the opponents that told him exactly how good his team was. “They started congratulating us,” he said. “They said they were just trying to get the game over with.” Woods has been a consistent contributor since his freshman year. His junior season he finished with 128 tackles and five sacks but over the last season, he helped turn himself into the four-star recruit with extensive study. “On the field I was learning the game more,” he said. “I got more downfield and understood the numbers better. I also became more of a leader. I liked coaching up the younger linebackers to make sure they are ready to take over.” Woods said practicing against the Walton offense everyday made him and the defense better, and that was reciprocated by the Raiders’ quarterback, Jeremy Hecklinski. “I’ve seen Ashton on defensive side of the ball for the last four years,” Hecklinski said. “He’s made me a lot better.” However, there is also seems to be a friendly rivalry between the two. “I kind of figured him out,” Hecklinski said. “I liked to mess with him during practice.” The duo will continue the rivalry in the ACC when Woods’ Tar Heels take on Hecklinski’s Wake Forest Deamon Deacons. Woods said there is one specific game that stands out from the 2023 season, and he added that it helped the team make the final jump it needed to be prepared for the postseason — the region opener against North Cobb. The Warriors jumped out to a 21-0 lead, but the Raiders found a way to tie the game in the second quarter, and then went on to win it. “That game made us a million times better,” Woods said. “It showed us we had a lot of heart.”",
