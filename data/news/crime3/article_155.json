    "text": "A uniformed policeman has been hailed as the life of the party after footage emerged of the officer apparently DJing at a beach rave. Footage posted to social media platform TikTok shows the NSW Police officer at a December party on [Turimetta beach](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Turimetta+Beach/@-33.7016527,151.3100787,16z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x6b0d54c3577d8caf:0x29361d717e6b51b!8m2!3d-33.6991746!4d151.3099034!16s%2Fm%2F027j2ll?entry=ttu), north of Narrabeen, in Sydney. He takes the reins as DJ, navigating the decks' buttons and dials, before handing the headphones back to its owner. The crowd appeared delighted to welcome their cameo DJ with a handful of rave attendees excitedly filming the short set while partygoers danced. \"Officers patrolling in the area attended and did their best to ensure the safety of everyone at the event,\" police said. [Footage](https://www.tiktok.com/@jesssiiikkkaaaa/video/7316409961158888705) of the rave was posted to TikTok with the caption \"welcome to Australia where the police get on the DJ decks instead of shutting the party down\" on December 26. NSW Police TikTok account responded saying \"this is defs going viral\". Sign up for our newsletter to stay up to date. We care about the protection of your data.
