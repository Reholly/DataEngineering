    "text": "Boro Park Shomrim is receiving accolades after busting a trio of burglars who were breaking into local storefronts in the wee hours of Friday morning.\nAt approximately 12:30 am, a Shomrim member observed three suspicious individuals in the area of 18th Ave. and 59th Street. The unit called for backup, with additional members joining the observation.\nWithin several minutes, the Shomrim members observed the trio attempting to break into stores, with the suspects finding success at a pizza shop at 18th and 55th, gaining entry by breaking through the metal grate blocking entry from the steps leading to the establishmentâ€™s basement.\nPolice were immediately alerted, and as the NYPD responded, the suspects promptly broke into another establishment.\nPolice officers quickly arrested the three suspects, finding a large sum of stolen cash on them.\nhttps://yeshivaworlds3.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/29100933/VID-20231229-WA0028.mp4\n(YWN NYC)\n ",
