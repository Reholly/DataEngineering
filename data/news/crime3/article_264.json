    "text": "A Washington state man said he “couldn’t be any prouder” of his son who is now facing federal charges related to Jan. 6 — and researched how to take a gun and a knife on a plane before attending the Capitol riot.\n“My son is a fine young man with a strong sense of right and wrong. I couldn’t be any prouder of him than I am today,” Larry Stickney\ntold KIRO 7 of his son, Matthew Stickney.\nMatthew Stickney, of Mountlake Terrace, was arrested on Dec. 20 on four charges — including breaking and remaining in a restricted building and disorderly conduct in a Capitol building — related to his alleged involvement in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot,\nKING 5 reported.\nFederal authorities believe they have identified several surveillance images of Stickney dressed in a black jacket and gray hoodie inside the Capitol during the pro-Trump rally, the criminal complaint viewed by The Post showed.\nThe Washington state resident’s GPS and cellphone data also placed him in the vicinity of the Capitol on Jan. 6, the complaint stated.\nEven so, the elder Stickney maintained his support for his adult son.\n“I’ll go through hell and back if that’s what it takes to help him and his family through this difficult time,” he insisted.\nLarry Stickney is an outspoken conservative and currently works as an aide for Pierce County District 3 Councilmember Amy Cruver, the outlet noted.\n“Are you asking me to comment on a father’s unconditional love for his son?” Cruver told KIRO 7 when contacted about Stickney’s comments.\n“Thank you for your interest, but this is not related to the business of my office at the council,” she said.\nAs part of the feds’ investigation into Matthew Stickney’s activities, a warrant to Google revealed that he made multiple bizarre searches in the days leading up to the riot, including, “How do I take my gun with me on a flight” and inquiries about bringing a gas mask and a knife on a plane, the criminal complaint said.\nOnline records showed that Stickney bought a plane ticket from Seattle to Washington, DC, two days before the riot and a return ticket for the following day.\nIt is not clear when he could appear in court, KIRO 7 reported.\nThe post\nWashington dad says he ‘couldn’t be prouder’ of son facing Jan. 6 charges appeared first on New York Post.",
