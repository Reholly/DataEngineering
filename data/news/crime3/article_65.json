    "text": "Connecticut State Police say seven new troopers and two instructors saved the life of a recruit over the summer at the academy in Middletown.\nNed Gerard/Hearst Connecticut Media MIDDLETOWN â€” Seven new state troopers and two instructors have been awarded for saving a recruit's life last summer, officials say.\nConnecticut State Police said trooper trainees Gunner Nunn, Julia Gettings, Justin Trzaski, Kelly Mazza, Lina Vivo, Nicholas Jamaitus and Donnell Niles received awards at their graduation ceremony Thursday for performing life-saving measures on a fellow recruit who collapsed at the Training Academy during the overnight hours last summer.\n\"After being sworn in as state troopers this morning during their graduation from the State Police Training Academy, the seven recruits, along with two academy instructors, were awarded the Medal for Lifesaving for responding to another recruit who was suffering from a severe medical emergency,\" police said. \"This is believed to be the first time newly sworn CT state troopers were awarded medals at their graduation.\"\nPolice said the two instructors who received awards were Trooper First Class Donald Dunning and Sgt. Jason St. John.\nOn Aug. 18, police said, a female recruit suffered a medical emergency during the early-morning hours. Police said her two roommates rendered urgent care before other recruits, some with extensive medal training, arrived to assist. They said their rapid response and their assistance with arriving emergency medical personnel is commendable, adding they were only in their ninth week of the 28-week academy.\n\"After providing immediate emergency medical care on site, academy staff and recruits coordinated ambulatory transport to Midstate Medical Center in Meriden and communication with the family of the recruit,\" they said. \"Doctors and staff at Midstate (Medical Center) quickly determined that the recruit in medical distress required urgent treatment from a facility with a higher level of care. However, severe thunderstorms prevented transport by helicopter.\"\nPolice said the ambulance that arrived to transport the recruit to Yale-New Haven Hospital struggled to navigate through heavy traffic because of the bad weather during rush hour, so academy staff cleared a path of travel and escorted it with emergency lights and sirens.\nMost Popular UConn women's basketball legend Breanna Stewart names her all-time starting five for Huskies UConn women's basketball recruit Morgan Cheli healthy and raising her game in senior season How UConn women's basketball coach Geno Auriemma, others view change in transfer rules Why CT 11-year-old will be UConn men's basketball assistant coach Mamadou Diarra's best man: 'My guy' Tractor-trailer driver ticketed in five-car pileup on I-84 in Middlebury, police say Union calls on Fairfield fire chief to resign, cites staffing, safety concerns Once at the hospital, police said, the recruit was rushed into an operating room where doctors were able to identify and treat the cause of her medical emergency during surgery. They said Yale medical staff and the recruit's family directly attributed the patient's survival to the response of academy staff and recruits.\n\"At a time of crisis, the support demonstrated by the staff and recruits during and after the incident displayed professionalism and care that went above and beyond expectations,\" they said.\nMore for you Deadline nearing to change parties for CT presidential primary\nPowerball ticket sold in CT wins $150K as jackpot rises to $760M",
