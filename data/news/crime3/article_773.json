The law enforcement has also strengthened patrols The United States is set to finish the year 2023 with a 'historic' decrease in annual homicide cases on record, said multiple news reports in the US media citing preliminary data collected by law enforcement agencies in the country. ABC News quoted Jeff Asher, a crime analyst, who said that nearly 13 per cent drop in homicide rate is expected by the end of year 2023 than the year 2022. However, the decreased homicide rate does not mean that Americans feel more secure. A Gallup poll which was released last month, revealed that more than three-quarters of the respondents felt that crime has increased in the country and more than half fell the same about crime in their area. trending now Watch | Japan to send patriot missiles to the United States The drop in homicides and other violent crimes in the year 2023 is being attributed to better efforts towards crime prevention which included work with community volunteers.
