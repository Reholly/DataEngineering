    "text": "A five-year-old girl seriously injured in an attack outside a Dublin school is out of danger, her mother has said. Through a message on a GoFundMe page, the child’s mother gave an update, saying the youngster is “more alert” and has smiled. She said: “Just to wish everyone a delayed Christmas and a happy new year. “Our angel has been out of the PICU (paediatric intensive care unit) for two weeks now. She is more alert and even smiled. “We still have a long time in hospital, but she is out of danger. Thank you everyone for all the help and support.” A number of people were hurt in the attack in Parnell Square East on November 23. The five-year-old girl and a creche worker are still receiving treatment for their injuries in hospital. Another girl, six, and a boy, five, were also treated in hospital but later discharged. A riot in Dublin city centre followed the attack, which led to a man being charged and put before a Dublin court. Riad Bouchaker, of no fixed address, is accused of trying to murder the two girls and boy. He is also charged with the assault causing serious harm to a care worker. He is further charged with three counts of assault causing harm and the possession and production of a 36cm kitchen knife.
