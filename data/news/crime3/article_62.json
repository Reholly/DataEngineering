    "text": "A new law in Virginia requiring health insurers, health maintenance organizations, and corporations to provide health care coverage subscription contracts for coverage of hearing aids and related services for anyone 18 years of age or younger will go into effect at the start of 2024. According to the [legislation](https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1003)—which passed in February 2023—coverage includes one hearing aid per ear, up to a cost of $1,500, every 24 months when an otolaryngologist recommends such hearing aids and related services. “I am honored to have worked alongside my co-sponsor, Senator Spruill, to introduce this bill,” said Senator Bill DeSteph (R-Virginia Beach) when the bill was initially passed in February. “Hearing loss can have a significant impact on a child’s development, and we believe that every child in Virginia deserves access to affordable hearing aids. With this new law, we are taking a significant step towards ensuring that all children in Virginia can receive the healthcare they need.” Further reading: [Illinois Senator Passes Law to Ensure Consumer Protections for Hearing Aid Returns](https://hearingreview.com/inside-hearing/legislation/illinois-senator-passes-law-to-ensure-consumer-protections-for-hearing-aid-returns) The legislation aims to provide families of hearing-challenged children to not worry about the high costs of hearing aids, according to a relase from the Senate of Virginia. The bill prohibits the State Corporation Commission from using any special fund revenues dedicated to the Commission’s other functions and duties, including revenues from utility consumer taxes or fees from licensees regulated by the Commission or fees paid to the office of the clerk of the Commission, to fund the defrayal of costs for the coverage provided as required by federal law.
