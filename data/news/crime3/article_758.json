    "text": "Beverage distributor offers safe options to avoid drinking and driving on New Year's Eve [Mike Randall](https://www.recordonline.com/staff/5327734002/mike-randall/) GOSHEN - The Orange County Sheriff's Office on Friday urged residents to take advantage of two programs offered by a local beverage distribution company to avoid drinking and driving on New Year's Eve. The sheriff's office said Goshen-based Dana Distributors offers the programs at participating establishments in Orange County and many surrounding counties. The first program, Decide to Ride, is a safe and easy way to get home when you are out and have had too much to drink to safely drive home yourself. Dana has provided participating establishments with a QR code for patrons to scan that will give them credit for an Uber or Lyft ride if they cannot drive home. Overpass removal: [Northbound Thruway in Orange, Ulster counties to close Jan. 6-7](/story/news/2023/12/27/northbound-thruway-to-close-for-overpass-removal-jan-6-7/72038683007/) The other program, Alert Cab, provides a similar service in the areas that Uber and Lyft do not reach: a voucher for a cab ride to return you to your residence. \"We encourage residents to take advantage of this service,\" the sheriff's office said in a statement. \"It can save your life and the lives of those traveling on our roadways. There is no excuse for drinking and driving.\" Mike Randall covers breaking news for the Times Herald-Record and the Poughkeepsie Journal.
