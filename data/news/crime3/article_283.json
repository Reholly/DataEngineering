    "text": "TANZANIA: TANZANIA has earned global recognition for its efforts to enhance capacity for dispensing justice in the field of intellectual property.\nThe recognition has come recently following initiatives to educate judges and magistrates in providing them with a nuanced understanding of intellectual property laws and effective case handling.\nChief Court Administrator Prof Elisante Ole Gabriel explained that Tanzania secured the second position globally for the extensive participation of judges and magistrates in training, with Egypt leading the way.\nProf Gabriel remarked this when addressing the journalists about various endeavours undertaken by the Judiciary.\nThe efforts aim to strengthen justice delivery in cases related to intellectual property.\nAmong the notable achievements highlighted by Prof Gabriel was the development of specific guidelines for intellectual property tailored for judges and magistrates.\nHe noted the collaboration between Tanzanian courts and the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) resulted in guidelines covering copyrights, trademarks, patents and industrial designs.\n\"Through collaboration with WIPO, Tanzanian courts have prepared guidelines on copyrights, trademarks, patents and industrial designs. These guidelines will serve as references for judges and magistrates when handling intellectual property cases,\" explained Prof Gabriel.\nHe also mentioned the active participation of judges and magistrates in distance learning programmes focused on intellectual property.\nProf Gabriel said in 2022 and 2023, WIPO provided sponsorship for 250 judges and magistrates to study these subjects through distance learning.\nHe stressed that distance learning initiatives significantly increased participants' understanding on intellectual property.\nFurthermore, Prof Gabriel disclosed that the Judiciary plans to hold graduation ceremonies for approximately 250 judges and magistrates who participated and successfully completed the intellectual property courses.\n\"This demonstrates that the Tanzanian Judiciary currently boasts a substantial number of judges and magistrates specialising in this area, providing excellent services for cases involving intellectual property and offering education to various groups, including innovators, businesspeople, companies and industrial owners,\" he emphasised.\nClose Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox\nTop Headlines Tanzania Governance Submit By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy .\nSuccess!
