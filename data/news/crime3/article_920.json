    "text": "The Netflix True Story Thriller That Grips You And Doesn’t Let Go\nAn action thriller released earlier this year, The Engineer is based on real events, covering one of the most unsettling and dramatic times in the recent history of Israel. Set in the mid-1990s, the film tells the story of the Shabak hunt for Yehiyah Ayyash, known as “The Engineer.” He was the bomb maker responsible for a series of bus bombs that killed Israeli civilians.\nThe Engineer tells the story of the hunt for Ayyash from the perspective of agents in Shin Bet, the Israel Security Agency.\nThe Engineer was released globally earlier this year and came from Israeli-born director Danny Abeckaser and Israeli producer Yoav Gross. It premiered in March at Mammoth California’s International Film Festival. Abeckaser, who is also an actor and screenwriter, was born in Israel, where he lived until he was nine years old.\nAfter Abeckaser’s family moved to Brooklyn, he grew up to become a nightclub promoter in New York City, later becoming a filmmaker. He shot The Engineer entirely in Israel, and did so for the purpose of telling an important story in his native country’s history.\nHe says he considers himself a storyteller first and was drawn to the events of these suicide bus bombs, which threatened the lives of innocent people inside Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.\nAlong with American actors like Robert Davi and star Emile Hirsch, the film also includes many Arab and Israeli actors who had never before had English-speaking roles.\nTelling the story of the terrorist actions of The Engineer was important for Abeckaser, who wanted to shed light on the motivations behind the bombings, even as he says clearly that terrorism is wrong and unacceptable. The film cleverly incorporates archival and news footage from key events during the timeline of the story from 1993 to 1996. Using a combination of real footage and newly-filmed recreations, it seeks to put audiences into the events as they took place.\nThe Engineer tells the story of the hunt for Ayyash from the perspective of agents in Shin Bet, the Israel Security Agency. The story follows, among other things, the high-risk infiltration of Gaza by the top-secret Mistaharavim unit that was sent to hunt for the bomber. The film also highlights the signing of the Oslo Accords, which came closer than ever to brokering a peaceful coexistence between Palestine and Israel.\nAbeckaser also wanted to use The Engineer as an opportunity to make a film that included a cast and crew from Israeli, Arab, and American backgrounds. Along with American actors like Robert Davi and star Emile Hirsch, the film also includes many Arab and Israeli actors who had never before had English-speaking roles. Streaming on\nNetflix, the film has brought these actors to an international audience they had not yet had the opportunity to reach.\nSet in the mid-1990s, the film tells the story of the Shabak hunt for Yehiyah Ayyash, known as “The Engineer.”\nThe Engineer also gave Abeckaser the chance to accomplish his goal of providing local actors with the chance to open up their career opportunities by being featured in a movie that would be seen around the world. For example, Director of Photography\nBarry Markowitz is a recent Israeli immigrant who can now add a Hollywood film to his resume.\nWhile his first goal is to entertain, Abeckaser also sought with this film to bring an international story, cast, and crew to a wide audience.\nThe Engineer is streaming now on Netflix.",
