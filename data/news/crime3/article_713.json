    "text": "Al-Marsad\nnewspaper: An Egyptian court acquitted a girl of charges of assaulting her father by hitting her with a shoe, after the father begged the judge to pardon her, for fear of losing her future.\nThe security authorities had received a report from a housewife accusing her younger sister of assaulting her elderly father with shoes, slapping him in the face, insulting him, hurling obscenities at him in front of the neighbors, and abusing her. After codifying the procedures, the aforementioned accused was arrested and referred to the Public Prosecution for investigation.\nThe girl said before the prosecution that a neighbor complained to her that her father was quarreling with him and insulting him, so she blamed her father and beat him to discipline him and prevent him from repeating his actions.\nThe eldest daughter continued in her report: The last of these violations against the elderly father was that the youngest daughter, 23 years old, assaulted him by hitting him with a shoe, claiming that she was disciplining him because he insulted one of the neighbors. The eldest daughter asked the judiciary to punish her father.\nThe neighbors testified to the veracity of the incident before the prosecution, and that the accused assaulted her father with the “shoe” after they heard him repeating, “Also, you can hit my father with the shoe, Sanaa.”\n#case #Egyptians #cry…a #girl #hits #father #shoe #surprising #ruling #court\n2023-12-29 17:18:49",
