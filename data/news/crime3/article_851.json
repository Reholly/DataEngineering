    "text": "Gypsy Rose Blanchard took to Instagram on Friday, a day after she completed her prison sentence for conspiring to kill her mother in 2015. Blanchard was released from the Chillicothe Correctional Center in Missouri, where she spent seven years for having her boyfriend, Nicholas Godejohn, go to her family’s home in Springfield to kill her mother, Dee Dee Blanchard. While Godejohn was sentenced in 2018 to life without parole, prosecutors considered the abuse Gypsy Rose Blanchard suffered at her mother’s hands and sought a 10-year sentence. In light of her release, [Gypsy Rose Blanchard posted a selfie on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/C1cNGBvu7IK/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=17ec984c-60ed-4c1b-85d2-3713b2bb2f99) with the caption, “First selfie of freedom!” View this post on Instagram Dee Dee Blanchard is believed to have suffered from Munchausen by proxy — which entailed forcing her daughter to use a wheelchair and subjecting her to unnecessary medical treatments. Before the slaying, Dee Dee Blanchard allegedly isolated her daughter and tied her to a bed to stop her from escaping. Earlier this month, Godejohn’s new lawyer appealed his first-degree murder conviction, claiming his client had an ineffective counsel. He accused Godejohn’s trial lawyers of failing to present evidence from a qualified neuropsychologist specializing in Autism Spectrum Disorder. Godejohn’s new lawyer said this evidence shows Godejohn had a diminished capacity and was unable to discern fantasy from reality. However, prosecutors have claimed Godejohn — who met Gypsy Rose Blanchard on a Christian dating site — was motivated by sex. Gypsy Rose Blanchard is married to a special education teacher from Louisiana. Her book — “Released: Conversations on the Eve of Freedom” — is expected to come out on January 9.
