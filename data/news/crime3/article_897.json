    "text": "Special counsel\nJack Smith and Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, the two prosecutors who've charged former President Donald Trump with attempting to overturn the 2020 presidential election, are the perfect people for the job, according to Washington Monthly columnist Margaret Carlson.\nCarlson appeared on Ari Melber's MSNBC show Thursday to discuss the two pivotal court cases moving through federal courts in Washington D.C. and state court in Georgia.\n\"We're in a world of hurt politically,\" Carlson said, \"but less so legally because we've got these two prosecutors who seem born for the moment to do this.\"\nMelber, himself an attorney, asked Carlson what she thought about Willis' willingness to make a \"bold move.\"\nCarlson praised Willis and noted it's not the first time the Georgia prosecutor has taken on tough cases, some of which wouldn't score her points with her political base.\n\"[Willis] is extremely, you know, admirable for going after her own side in Georgia,\" Carlson said.\nBreaking up the\nteacher test cheating ring in particular, noted Carlson, is an indication of how deftly Willis is able to navigate politically fraught issues.\n\"The Democrats don't want anybody going after their teachers and, you know, she took it on and it was a very hard one to explain to people why you'd be going after teachers,\" said Carlson.\n\"But it's the worst kind of cheating, and she seems personally offended by corruption, which is a wonderful thing for a prosecutor to have.\"\nWatch the video below or at the link here.",
