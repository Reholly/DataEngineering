    "text": "Watch Now: Kornet provided 20 points (9-11 FG, 2-2 FT), eight rebounds, three assists and three blocks in 33 minutes during Friday's 120-118 win over the Raptors.\nKornet thrived in a starting role, logging a season-high 33 minutes in the victory. With Kristaps Porzingis (calf) and Al Horford (rest) on the sideline, Kornet was the next man up for Boston. While this was an encouraging performance, Kornet could very well be out of the rotation when the Celtics face the Spurs on Sunday. If we get word that they are shorthanded again, Kornet would make for a viable stream candidate.\nMore News Celtics' Luke Kornet: Gets rare start 5H ago • by RotoWire Staff Celtics' Luke Kornet: Available Monday 4D ago • by RotoWire Staff Celtics' Luke Kornet: Likely to play Monday 5D ago • by RotoWire Staff Celtics' Luke Kornet: Out again Saturday 7D ago • by RotoWire Staff Celtics' Luke Kornet: Will miss one week 14D ago • by RotoWire Staff Celtics' Luke Kornet: Won't play Friday 14D ago • by RotoWire Staff Our Latest Fantasy Basketball Stories Waiver Wire: Week 11 Alex Rikleen • 7 min read December rookie report: Chet, Victor, more Alex Barutha • 6 min read Christmas Day slate games, more Steve Alexander • 7 min read Waiver Wire: Week 10 Alex Rikleen • 6 min read Week 9 pulse check: Who's hot, who's not Alex Barutha • 7 min read Week 9 starts/sits: Top NBA fantasy plays Adam King • 4 min read",
