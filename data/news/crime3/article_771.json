    "text": "The AFP's crime-fighting efforts in Western Australia this year have resulted in children removed from harm overseas, a crackdown on international cybercriminals and large seizures of illicit drugs. The AFP's Western Command, which operates across WA, has disrupted multiple international drug trafficking networks in the past 12 months and seized more than two tonnes of cocaine and methamphetamine destined for Australian communities. AFP Assistant Commissioner Pryce Scanlan said WA's extensive, and mostly isolated, coastline made it an attractive target for transnational serious organised crime groups. \"The drug seizures and associated arrests this year highlight the damage that law enforcement and intelligence agencies can inflict on these criminals by working together across borders,\" he said. \"The AFP's members are dedicated to preventing harm to Australians. We share intelligence and resources with WA Police Force locally, Australian Border Force and other Commonwealth partners around the country and with foreign counterparts - to ensure we can respond, no matter where the threat originates.\" Assistant Commissioner Scanlan said about 70 per cent of the serious organised crime figures who preyed on Australians were based offshore and the AFP was increasingly seeing international links in cybercrime and online child abuse matters. \"The AFP is based in 34 countries and the strong relationships built around the world are vital to combat the borderless nature of the crime threats and keep Australians safe at home,\" he said. AFP cybercrime investigators in WA led the AFP's significant contribution to the international operation to [disrupt BlackCat](https://www.afp.gov.au/news-centre/media-release/russian-led-hacking-group-disrupted-australian-businesses-regain-access), a Russian-led hacking group that has targeted at least 56 businesses and government agencies in Australia. A number of Australian organisations that fell victim to the ransomware criminals will receive a decryption tool to restore their systems after the FBI-led global operation. Protecting children from exploitation and abuse, and educating families to help keep children safe, is a key priority for the AFP. This year, the AFP has charged 24 West Australians with online child exploitation and abuse offences. Two of the investigations also resulted in a young girl removed from harm in the United Kingdom and another removed from harm in the Philippines. In December (2023), a Perth man pleaded guilty to 118 offences relating to the online sextortion of more than 100 girls around the world. The AFP investigation started in 2021, with work continuing throughout the court process. Western Command worked tirelessly to protect and assist people reporting human trafficking crimes this year, including women and children at risk of forced marriage and individuals exploited through forced labour. The AFP has been instrumental in ensuring the wellbeing and safety of vulnerable people by removing them from harmful situations and connecting them to support by partner agencies. The AFP is working with partners to build awareness and combat human trafficking and slavery in WA. The AFP is focused on not only prosecuting criminal syndicates but removing the benefits from illegal activity. The AFP-led Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce (CACT) has restrained $1.1 billion in criminal assets nationally in the past four years, with almost half of that milestone restrained this calendar year alone. The CACT's proceeds of crime investigations include the [restraint in late November of about $200,000 cash and eight properties](https://www.afp.gov.au/news-centre/media-release/afp-restrains-cash-and-properties-linked-wa-man) owned by a WA illicit tobacco trafficker. At the airport, AFP officers have this year intervened when disruptive or aggressive passengers have risked safety on board flights or in terminals and have prevented air travel being used to facilitate criminal activity. Incidents include a [man charged](https://www.afp.gov.au/news-centre/media-release/about-3 -cash-seized-traveller-perth) in March after he allegedly tried to fly interstate from Perth with bundles of cash hidden in his carry-on bag. The man claimed he had about $300,000 but when the cash was formally counted, it totalled $618,360. The matter remains before the court. In September, another [man was charged](https://www.afp.gov.au/news-centre/media-release/airline-passenger-arrested-alleged-unruly-behaviour) after he allegedly behaved in a disorderly behaviour and failed to comply with airline staff on board a domestic flight, resulting in the flight being turned around. The AFP's work also includes counter-terrorism and protection of critical infrastructure at remote and metropolitan sites. This year the AFP launched one of its biggest [Protective Service Officer (PSO) recruitment](https://www.afp.gov.au/news-centre/media-release/afp-launches-pso-recruitment-blitz) drives, searching for people who want a new rewarding and exciting career, including working in remote locations at Geraldton and Exmouth. AC Scanlan said Western Command, like the rest of the AFP, was focusing on 2024 and developing innovative ways to combat crime threats and protect the community. \"The AFP is working tirelessly to keep Australians safe and we are always looking for people to join the AFP who want to help serve and protect their community,\" he said. Some of the major drug seizures in 2023 (photos and footage in the links): August 2023: The AFP [charged three men for their alleged involvement in the importation and possession of about 560kg of cocaine](https://www.afp.gov.au/news-centre/media-release/three-charged-after-560kg-cocaine-seized-wa), which was found in a small coastal town in Western Australia. In November, another [two Queensland men](https://www.afp.gov.au/news-centre/media-release/queensland-men-arrested-over-560kg-wa-cocaine-bust) were charged, with police alleging they had also been involved in the attempted importation. The investigation involves the AFP, ABF, WAPF, and Department of Home Affairs. May 2023: Seven people have been charged for their alleged roles in attempting to import 850kg of cocaine into Australia in May hidden on a bulk cargo carrier. Those charged include [three men](https://www.afp.gov.au/news-centre/media-release/more-800kg-cocaine-seized-wa-three-arrests) who allegedly travelled off the coast of Fremantle in a cabin cruiser to try to collect the drugs and two [senior crew members](https://www.afp.gov.au/news-centre/media-release/two-cargo-carrier-crew-charged-over-wa-850kg-cocaine-bust) of the bulk cargo carrier, who police allege knew the drugs were on the ship and planned to drop them overboard for collection. A [man and woman](https://www.afp.gov.au/news-centre/media-release/afp-charges-two-more-alleged-offenders-over-attempted-850kg-cocaine), who police allege are part of the Australian-based syndicate responsible for collecting the drugs and facilitating the logistics of the importation, have also been charged. February 2023: Three men have been charged over the importation of more than [300kg of cocaine](https://www.afp.gov.au/news-centre/media-release/afp-charges-third-wa-man-over-300kg-cocaine-haul), which was found in a [capsized vessel](https://www.afp.gov.au/news-centre/media-release/one-arrested-part-international-investigation-365kg-cocaine-seized-wa) and in the ocean in WA's Great Southern region. Investigations are ongoing into how and where the drugs were dropped in the ocean before they were allegedly collected by the three men.
