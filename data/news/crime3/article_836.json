It could be affecting your sister, your mother, your daughter, your niece, your friend, your colleague, your neighbour – changing attitudes and creating a generation free from abuse is down to every one of us today.\n“We have to reach more women sooner so they can get help earlier, we have to raise awareness to help women spot the signs, we must change laws, attitudes, and behaviours in society, and that way we will ultimately save lives. I will not rest until domestic abuse is eliminated.”",
