    "text": "The Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has approved the release of no less than 246 inmates in the state.\nThis, according to information shared on the state government’s X handle on Friday night, was based on the recommendation of the Advisory Council on Prerogative of Mercy.\nSanwo-Olu further approved committal of death sentence for 39 inmates to life imprisonment.\nPrerogative of Mercy is the power to grant pardon or clemency to persons who have been convicted of certain offences.\nThis power is vested mostly in the President of Nigeria or the governor of a state.\n“The governor signed the release and committal orders on the 20th of December, 2023 in cognisance of the New Year celebrations.\n“The exercise is in pursuant to the provisions of Section 212 (1) (2) of the 1999 Constitution of The Federal Republic of Nigeria (amended),” the state government post partly read.\nIt added that the Advisory Council on Prerogative of Mercy in reaching its recommendations exercised due diligence in its deliberation of the applications in line with the applicable guidelines.\n“The Council took note of the information provided by the correctional authorities, the nature of the offence, period of incarceration, age, health and behavioural conduct of the inmates. The approval for the release of the inmates is in line with the commitment of Mr Governor to decongest correctional facilities in Lagos State as part of the Justice Sector Reforms,” it noted.\nIn 2021, Sanwo-Olu approved the release and committal of the sentences of four inmates in the state’s correctional centres.\nAlso, on September 30, 2022, Sanwo-Olu, on the recommendation of the Advisory Council on the Prerogative of Mercy, approved the release of 46 inmates from various correctional facilities across the state and commuted the death sentences of six inmates to life imprisonment.",
