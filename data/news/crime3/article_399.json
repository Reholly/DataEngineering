In response to queries about the future course of action in the case, the MEA mentioned that it would await the detailed judgment before making any additional comments. However, it noted that discussions on the next steps would take place with the legal team and family members. During a press conference on Friday, MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said, \"The sentences have been reduced but I don't have any additional information to share until we see the detailed judgment. We would urge you again not to engage in speculation. The interests of Indians and their family members are our foremost concern. We will also of course be discussing the next possible steps with the legal team and the family members.\" [English Jagran.com](https://english.jagran.com/)Jagran English is available on WhatsApp. Join now for latest news from India and around the world.
