    "text": "The little girl critically injured in the Dublin crèche attack is out of danger – and has even smiled, her mother has revealed. The five year old, who suffered serious injuries in the November 23 attack on the crèche at Gaelscoil Cholaiste Mhuire on the city’s Parnell Square East, is still receiving hospital treatment – but her mum says her condition has now improved. The mother last night took to a special GoFundme page - *’Barróg do Chailín Beag’ (A Hug for a Little Girl) - * to help the family with costs following the incident to thank everyone for their help and give the good news about the girl’s condition. She told contributors that her daughter left the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit of CHI’s Temple Street Hospital close to the scene of the attack a fortnight ago. She said: “Hi everyone, here is the little girl’s mum. “Just to wish everyone a delayed [Christmas](https://www.dublinlive.ie/all-about/christmas) and a Happy new year. “Our angel has been out of the PICU for two weeks now. She is more alert and even smiled. “We still have a long time still in hospital, but she is out of danger. Thank you everyone for all the help and support. All our love.” The child has been in hospital since the November 23 attack – in which two other kids and three adults were injured. The special [GoFundme page](https://gofund.me/6b6f1e1e) was set up in the wake of the attack and as of last night has raised more than €58,000 for the child and her family. News of the girl’s improvement came as Riad Bouchaker, 50, of no fixed abode, made his second court appearance over the alleged attack. Mr Bouchaker is charged with three counts of attempted murder, one of producing and possessing a 36cm kitchen knife, three counts of assault causing harm and one of assault causing serious harm. He was remanded in custody yesterday to appear at Cloverhill District Court in west [Dublin](https://www.dublinlive.ie/all-about/dublin) on January 25. The same court heard yesterday that he is to face trial in front of a judge and jury on the charges and a book of evidence is now being prepared.
