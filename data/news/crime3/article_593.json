    "text": "GA based Kenneth S. Nugent, P.C. - Savannah is urging the community to get in touch with a wrongful death lawyer if a loved one recently passed away under suspicious circumstances. If their passing was the result of another party’s misconduct or negligence, a wrongful death claim can help survivors obtain compensation for their loss and suffering.\nKenneth S. Nugent, P.C. offers the community a free initial consultation if they wish to speak with a legal professional regarding their options. Upon examining their case, the firm will explain what can be done to move forward. Further, the firm works on a contingency basis, so they will accept payment for their services only if the case has a positive outcome. See more here: Wrongful Death Lawyer Macon .\nThe firm states, “A loved one’s sudden passing is always a traumatic event, and most people in this situation will want little more than to grieve their loss in peace. Unfortunately, there are often a number of practical concerns that must be dealt with regardless, such as funeral expenses, loss of income, medical bills and so on. We’re here to reassure you that you will not have to face these concerns on your own — and we will pursue the compensation you are legally entitled to on your behalf.”\nThe firm has represented numerous clients in such cases, and they say that a common theme among survivors is the belief that no amount of compensation would be able to equate the loss of their loved one. While this is incontestably true, compensation is intended to alleviate their suffering as much as possible, and the firm strongly advises survivors to pursue it, especially if the deceased individual was the sole income earner in their family.\nWrongful death cases are notoriously complex, and it can be a daunting prospect to navigate the legal system. This is why it is advisable for anyone in this situation to hire an experienced wrongful death lawyer who will investigate and advocate on their behalf. Kenneth S. Nugent, P.C. has a long history of successful cases, and they are proud to offer their services to anyone who needs assistance with a wrongful death claim.\nThis assistance can take many forms. According to the firm, it is often necessary to obtain evidence to establish liability, proving conclusively that the death in question was a result of negligence (or even an intent to harm). The team may gather evidence, interview witnesses, review medical records, consult with experts and so on as the case proceeds.\nWorking with a firm as reputable and large as Kenneth S. Nugent, P.C. also has a number of other advantages. Experts, for instance, are more likely to work with such firms, especially if they have an existing working relationship. The insights from such professionals, such as accident reconstruction specialists, can do much to support a wrongful death claim and ensure a successful outcome.\nThis is extremely important since insurance companies (and defense attorneys) will likewise do their utmost to avoid liability altogether or at least minimize settlements in wrongful death cases. Countering them requires both an intrinsic knowledge of the law as well as deep negotiation skills, backed by strong evidence. The best way to combine these factors and present an ironclad claim is to work with a wrongful death lawyer who is accustomed to dealing with such challenges.\nThe firm makes it a point to make every client feel as if they are valued and prioritized at all times, and this applies in all manner of cases. “Amazing experience,” says one client of the firm. “I had a minor car accident so it wasn’t going to pay them out that much, but they still treated me great, and the communication was exceptional. My case manager, Amanda, always responded within a day to any of my questions or concerns, and my legal assistant, Lauren, literally replied within minutes of my emails every time! I was always kept in the loop, and everything was thoroughly explained to me. I would 1000% recommend, their good name has absolutely been earned!”\nSavannah residents may contact the firm via phone or email to schedule their free initial consultation.
