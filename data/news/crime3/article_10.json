    "text": "NEW PARIS, Ind. (WSBT) — An attempted break in at a New Paris Church on Christmas eve was unsuccessful.\nThe Church of the Nazarene had two different failed break-in locations – one in a storage shed and another in the church.\nA church official says planning helped repel the thieves.\nAround 5 a.m. on Christmas Eve morning, a motion detecting alarm was triggered from a broken window in the church. Before it was broken, this Christmas Grinch had attempted to get in the church's shed.\n\"They started out with the shed, broke to it first, and they were unable to get anything out of it, because everything was cabled and chained up. And then evidently, they came over to the church window,” said Bob Rossi, Church of the Nazarene Head Trustee.\nThe shed had a thick cable connecting all equipment inside. So, if someone were to break past the locked door, they would not leave with the equipment inside.\nIn a Kevin McCallister-like-move from the Christmas classic Home Alone, a previous break in inspired defensive measures made to protect the property from any type of burglary.\n\"They did break the padlock and got in the building, but they were able to get away with her mower and stuff and after that that's when I decided well, I'm going to cable everything so if they do get in the building they would not be able to get anything out of it,” said Rossi.\nRossi says this defensive move worked like a charm.\n“Unless they had something to cut a pretty heavy cable,” said Rossi.\nSE: And that defense worked?\n“That worked they were not able to get the stuff out of the building,” said Rossi.\nRossi says he's grateful the church's Christmas morning services were able to go on as planned that next day and that nothing was taken.\n\"We are just grateful they never got them, and never got away with anything,” said Rossi.\nThe church will continue to stay open every Sunday even if the window is temporarily boarded up.\nIf you have any additional information on this failed break in, please contact the Elkhart County Sheriff’s Office.",
