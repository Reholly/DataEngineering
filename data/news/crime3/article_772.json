    "text": "US on path to see ‘historic’ drop in yearly homicide numbers: Report US on path to see ‘historic’ drop in yearly homicide numbers: Report The United States is expected to witness a significant decrease in annual homicide cases by the end of 2023, marking a ‘historic’ decline in crime rates. Crime analyst Jeff Asher has predicted a nearly 13% drop in the homicide rate compared to the previous year. However, despite this positive trend, a recent Gallup poll revealed that a majority of Americans still feel that crime has increased in the country. Better Crime Prevention Efforts and Gun Control Measures The drop in homicides and other violent crimes in 2023 is being attributed to improved efforts towards crime prevention, including collaboration with community volunteers and targeted gun control measures in high-crime areas. Additionally, law enforcement agencies have strengthened patrols to curb criminal activities. Decline in Homicides Across Major US Cities Following data obtained from a review by ABC News, the 10 largest cities in the US have shown significant declines in homicide rates, with seven municipalities reporting double-digit year-over-year decreases. Cities like New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago have witnessed notable drops in homicide numbers, indicating a national decline in crime rates. Photo Credit: i.abcnewsfe.com",
