    "text": "The true crime fixation has always been somewhat real for TV viewers, but the obsession grew more real with the rise of the\nstreaming realm. Netflix, Hulu, Peacock, Amazon, HBO Max, and Paramount+ have all joined in with the “fun,” and we’ve done our part to round up the 50 best true crime shows. So true crime fans: lock the doors, draw those blinds, and pick a show to binge watch from the list below.\nLast updated December 29, 2023.\n1. The Staircase (The O.G.)\nYear: 2004-2018\nStarring: Michael Peterson\nGenre: Docuseries\nRating: TV-MA\nSeasons: 1 (14 episodes)\nDirector: Jean-Xavier de Lestrade\nTrailer:\nWatch here\nThis doesn’t technically qualify as the O.G. true crime series of all time, but one would be hard-pressed to find a more notoriously bingeable classic than Jean-Xavier de Lestrade’s The Staircase. The story of Michael Peterson emerged in this simmering series that delved into the part he played in his wife’s 2001 death. Kathleen did, of course, die under mysterious circumstances, and\ntheories still abound that might reveal a cause more extraordinary and downright bizarre. Michael has been already been convicted and released for time served, but follow-up episodes happened, along with an HBO dramatization that appears further down in this list.\n2. Under The Banner Of Heaven\nYear: 2022\nStarring: Andrew Garfield, Gil Birmingham, Daisy Edgar-Jones\nGenre: Drama series\nRating: TV-MA\nSeasons: 1 (7 episodes)\nDirector: David Mackenzie\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.hulu.com/series/under-the-banner-of-heaven-9c4ae394-e9c4-4a6d-985e-314270602c6b\nNow for something completely different. This series will hit the spot for who’s still salty about how True Detective‘s second season shook out. The story is based upon Jon Krakauer’s non-fiction bestseller, for which A Story of Violent Faith is a subtitle, so you can accurately guess that things don’t go well for the character played by Daisy Edgar-Jones (who also had quite an ordeal\nin this year’s Fresh). The story presents a husband-as-suspect to a double murder, but it swiftly becomes apparent that there’s much more going on, and Andrew Garfield shines as a detective who’s also a devout Latter Day Saints member. Those lingering Spidey senses do still come in handy for him, as well as for this show’s audience. Cue some swirling conspiracies that the Mormon church hasn’t enjoyed IRL, which means that this one strikes a chord on multiple levels. That’s a hallmark of an enduring true-crime show, for sure.\n3. Chernobyl\nYear: 2019\nStarring: Jared Harris, Stellan Skarsgård, Emily Watson, Jesse Buckley, Paul Ritter\nGenre: Drama series\nRating: TV-MA\nSeasons: 1 (5 episodes)\nDirector: Johan Renck\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.hbomax.com/series/urn:hbo:series:GXJvkMAU0JIG6gAEAAAIo\nNuclear crimes (and their cover ups) are definitely crimes, so this show counts for the list. Showrunner Craig Mazin (who is now\nmasterfully helming The Last Of Us in a completely different realm for HBO) did the thing here, long after his work on The Hangover franchise, to give us an unflinching look at one of the most devastating man-made disasters in history. Not only that, but this series proved that event TV could still exist on HBO even after Game of Thrones. Through five rollercoaster episodes, the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant explosion yielded heroic sacrifices and catastrophic f*ckups and the horrifying, heartbreaking story that one won’t find in the history books. Mazin and director Johan Renck left no detail unturned in their quest for authenticity, and the dynamic duo of Jared Harris and Stellan Skarsgård can’t be beat for an all-encompassing portrait of the best and worst that humanity has to offer.\n4. The Jinx: The Life And Deaths Of Robert Durst\nYear: 2015\nGenre: Docuseries\nRating: TV-MA\nSeasons: 1 (6 episodes)\nDirector: Andrew Jarecki\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.hbomax.com/series/urn:hbo:series:GVU2_3QlhmYNJjhsJAWUZ\nIn early 2022, Robert Durst died while incarcerated, but it took a hell of an effort to put him behind bars in the first place. During the production of The Jinx, no one knew whether he’d ever pay for his fatal crimes, given that Durst had been repeatedly been accused of murder but never successfully convicted. His luck did eventually run out, but when this series debuted in 2015, this limited series highlighted the wild history of its subject while pointedly noting his long-standing status as a suspect in his wife’s disappearance 40+ years prior. And as it turned out, his ultimate conviction involved Durst killing someone who knew too much about that old crime. This project dives into police files and archival footage just like many other true crime docuseries tend to do, but the end result is wholly unique and hits even harder after his conviction.\n5. I’ll Be Gone In The Dark\nYear: 2020\nStarring: Michelle McNamara, Patton Oswalt\nGenre: Docuseries\nRating: TV-MA\nSeasons: 1 (7 episodes)\nDirector: Liz Garbus\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.hbomax.com/series/urn:hbo:series:GXqxXYwlxdEKuqwEAAASS\nThe life and work of the late Michelle McNamara — citizen investigator, blogger, and\nadmitted developer of a “murder habit” — takes center stage in this revelatory series. At the time of her death, Michelle’s husband (Patton Oswalt) decided to do everything possible to complete the book that became the subject of this limited story, which emerges as a “portrait of an artist” who also happened to live for the pursuit of justice. Michelle’s book led to the arrest of her biggest obsession, the Golden State Killer, and this led to closure for the victims (and their families) who suffered for decades after the perpetrator’s 50 rapes and 12 murders. Following Joseph James DeAngelo’s capture, he pled guilty on the day after this series’ debut, and the entire shakedown followed miraculous efforts by McNamara and her post-death collaborators, investigative journalist Billy Jensen and crime writer Paul Haynes. It’s a story of obsession, yes, but one that thankfully led to progress.\n6. Narcos/Narcos Mexico\nYear: 2015 – 2021\nStarring: Wagner Moura, Pedro Pascal, Boyd Holbrook, Scoot McNairy, José María Yazpik, Alejandro Edda, Michael Peña, Diego Luna\nGenre: Crime dramatization\nRating: TV-MA\nSeasons: 3 (30 episodes)\nCreators: Carlo Bernard, Chris Brancato, Doug Miro\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.netflix.com/title/80025172\nFirst, the franchise tangled with the sometimes comically sad yet inherently destructive saga of Pablo Escobar (Wagner Maura) and associated drug lords. Then it took on fresh legs with a spinoff. As such, Scoot McNairy\nguided this explosive saga home, years after Narcos introduced us to his brother from another mother, the rough-and-tumble Agent Murphy (Boyd Holbrook). The spinoff began with Michael Peña’s wild-eyed Kiki Camerena’s ill-fated dive into taking down drug cartels that, as we later learn, never truly fall but end up sprouting hydra heads. Scoot picked up the story as a fictionalized character with plenty of demons of his own while he sought to carry on Kiki’s legacy and realize that this is a never-ending war.\n7. McMillion$\nYear: 2020\nStarring:\nAgent Doug\nGenre: Docuseries\nRating: TV-MA\nSeasons: 1 (6 episodes)\nDirectors: James Lee Hernandez, Brian Lazarte\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.hbomax.com/series/urn:hbo:series:GXflGcQEvOZWdkQEAAAE3\nAgent Doug Matthews, who is vital to the appeal of this miniseries, remains a\nfantastic character despite being a real-life person. It’s also really something that a popular fast-food Monopoly game became the subject of a decade long, fraudulent ring that inspired one of the most entertaining true crime series in existence. This is a simple story, really, but it’s wild to behold the sheer audacity of all involved. The mob surfaces, yes, and there’s a hefty dose of Florida going on, along with almost unprecedented glee in this retelling of events, and you can’t help but get swept up in the madness. What a fun story that you don’t have to feel even guilty about gawking at while watching. A win-win in a genre that could often (pardon the pun) use a little life.\n8. The People V. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story\nYear: 2016\nStarring: Cuba Gooding Jr., Sterling K. Brown, David Schwimmer, Nathan Lane, Sarah Paulson, Kenneth Choi, John Travolta, Courtney B. Vance\nGenre: Drama series\nRating: TV14\nSeasons: 1 (10 episodes) of a larger anthology series\nDirectors: Ryan Murphy, Anthony Hemingway, John Singleton\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.hulu.com/series/oj-made-in-america-d6d1f241-2fc0-4ff9-a8f8-42e04f182787\nThe trial of the century transformed into an adapted horror tale through the deft hand of Ryan Murphy, who might (after Dahmer and The Watcher) now be the real godfather of the more exploitative wing of the true crime genre. Cuba Gooding Jr. stealthily stepped into those gloves, and David Schwimmer uttered “Juice”\nso many times that I nearly forgot about Ross Geller’s own reign of terror. Further, we’ve got another look at how Robert Kardashian not only helped to engineer O.J.’s (temporary) freedom following the death of Nicole Brown Simpson, but also how he inadvertently changed the very nature of fame throughout this televised trial (and by extension, through his family following his death). The nostalgia runs heavy here, obviously, because O.J.’s Bronco-bound chase turned out to be one of those moments where you always remember where you were when it popped up on TV. If the TV show fits, you must acquit (?), or something like that.\n9. Dahmer – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story\nYear: 2022\nStarring: Evan Peters, Niece Nash, Molly Ringwald, Penelope Ann Miller\nGenre: Drama series\nRating: TV-MA\nSeasons: 1 (10 episodes)\nDirectors: Carl Franklin, Clement Virgo, Jennifer Lynch, Gregg Araki, Paris Barclay\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.netflix.com/title/81287562\nRyan Murphy and Netflix continue their long-running love affair, even when things get seriously grody as in “cannibalism.” This series not be my cup of tea (because I do like to keep my appetite intact), but the masses quickly racked up over a billion hours of viewing time. Obviously, things got icky with Evan Peters as the infamous cannibalistic serial killer who carried out his shocking crimes from within his Wisconsin apartment. Make sure that you don’t eat too much before settling down to binge this selection, and get ready because Monster will return in anthologized form while focusing upon a different serial killer.\n10. The Case Against Adnan Syed\nYear: 2019\nGenre: Docuseries\nRating: TV-14\nSeasons: 1 (4 episodes)\nDirector: Amy Berg\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.hbo.com/the-case-against-adnan-syed/season-1\nDevotees of the Serial podcast climbed aboard this followup series from Amy Berg (Deliver Us From Evil, Phoenix Rising), who follows up with exclusive Syed access and new revelations that throw all kinds of legal proceedings into disarray. As listeners already know, Syed served two decades in prison for the murder of his girlfriend, Hae Min Lee, in 1999. Various motives from other parties do rear their heads, and no matter how you felt about the podcast’s accounting of events, get ready to relive and reassess them. As a late-breaking update, Syed’s conviction was actually vacated in September 2022, which has prompted an additional episode to go into production. Look for that installment in 2023.\n11. When They See Us\nYear: 2019\nStarring: Jharrel Jerome, Asante Blackk, Freddy Miyares, Michael Kenneth Williams, Felicity Huffman\nGenre: Drama series\nRating: TV-MA\nSeasons: 1 (4 episodes)\nDirector: Ava DuVernay\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.netflix.com/title/80200549\nThis unsettling but valuable watch\nretells the Central Park Five case, in which five teenagers (ranging from ages 14-16) of color were arrested and charged with a host of crimes, including the rape and attempted murder of Trisha Meili, in 1989. All five defendants were convicted, and this series follows the ghastly mechanisms of corruption by police and prosecutors, who not only crushed these young men but also their families. You may not recognize the wrongly accused — Antron McCray, Raymond Santana, Kevin Richardson, Yusef Salaam, and Korey Wise — by name, but Ava DuVernay (who created, co-wrote, and directed here) made it her mission to imprint their journeys upon viewers.\n12. Unbelievable\nYear: 2019\nStarring: Toni Collette, Merritt Wever, Kaitlyn Dever\nGenre: Drama series\nRating: TV-MA\nSeasons: 1 (6 episodes)\nDirector: Lisa Cholodenko, Michael Dinner, Susannah Grant\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.netflix.com/title/80153467\nA major trigger warning arrives for this series, which\nfeels almost insurgent in its approach and delivers powerhouse performances from Toni Collette, Merritt Wever, and Kaitlyn Dever. The two former ladies play detectives who uncover ties between sexual assault cases that could actually achieve justice in a world where less than 1% of rapes are followed by felony convictions. Meanwhile, Dever shines a light on how so-called “imperfect victims” fight the ultimate uphill battle to tell their true stories while also not-infrequently being treated like criminals themselves. Boy, her character goes through hell while confronted with a massive burden of proof, which ends up being a legal nightmare. Admittedly, this sounds god-awful as viewing material, but it’s a watchable paradigm-shifter of a series.\n13. Dirty John\nYear: 2018\nStarring: Connie Britton, Eric Bana, Julia Garner, Jean Smart\nGenre: Drama series\nRating: TV-MA\nSeasons: 1 (8 episodes)\nDirector: Jeffrey Reiner\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.netflix.com/title/80241855\nThis adaptation of a popular podcast (hosted by Christopher Goffard of L.A. Times) brought John Meehan’s psychopathic tendencies into full view through a wild-eyed portrayal by Eric Bana. Likewise, Connie Britton doled out a convincing version of Debra, who was swept up by a charismatic “anesthesiologist,” who seems to be the ideal catch but soon casts an intricate web of con-man tactics. This is a cautionary real-life tale, but it’s also an indictment of a system that\nallowed a manipulator to flourish. Progressively, John’s backstory disintegrates, and he terrorizes those who challenge him. This show might actually make you feel better about your own dating choices because damn, this John wasn’t simply dirty. He was downright filthy.\n14. Dopesick\nYear: 2021\nStarring: Michael Keaton, Rosario Dawson, Peter Saarsgard\nGenre: Drama series\nRating: TV-MA\nSeasons: 1 (8 episodes)\nDirectors: Danny Strong, Barry Levinson, Michael Cuesta, Patricia Riggen\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.hulu.com/series/dopesick-227de06a-d3d4-42e0-9df1-bb5495e1738d\nTough subject comes to light here with Michael Keaton (executive producing) taking on the massive Oxycontin epidemic from the inside out and also (as the star) portraying a doctor who plays his own role in the mess. Big Pharma’s a big bad guy here, and this series is an intense adaptation of Beth Macy’s New York Times bestseller full of heroes and villains and a wide-spanning set of crimes staring down justice. Keaton clearly relishes being able to tackle such complex stories, and it’s a personal story for him, too, given that\nhe lost a nephew to addiction.\n15. Murder On Middle Beach\nYear: 2020\nStarring: Madison Hamburg\nGenre: Docuseries\nRating: TV-MA\nSeasons: 1 (4 episodes)\nDirector: Madison Hamburg\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.hbomax.com/series/urn:hbo:series:GX3hmdAVQOYuZmAEAAAEJ\nThis project arrives as an intensely personal one for\ndirector Madison Hamburg because it charts his own search for his mother’s killer. If that doesn’t sound harrowing enough, consider that Hamburg felt driven to do so because law enforcement’s trail ran absurdly cold. There’s also a point in the docuseries where he may have interviewed his mother’s killer on camera. And if that still doesn’t intrigue you, consider that Madison put himself into some incredibly risky situations to capture audio footage, and although Barbara Hamburg’s murder remains unsolved to this day, if there’s anyone who can possibly solve this crime, it’s this fearless filmmaker. Quite simply, Hamburg wasn’t afraid to get raw and dangerous in a project that upends the genre.\n16. Bad Vegan: Fame. Fraud. Fugitives.\nYear: 2022\nStarring: Sarma Melngailis\nGenre: Docuseries\nRating: TV-MA\nSeasons: 1 (4 episodes)\nDirector: Chris Smith\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.netflix.com/title/81470938\nThis project charts the fall of celebrity NYC restauranteur Sarma Melngailis, who\nwasn’t exactly thrilled with this show’s ending, which she called “misleading,” but block out a handful of hours because once you start watching this, you don’t be able to stop. Vegan beefs will abound while viewers will wonder how, exactly, Sarma fell under the spell of shifty Anthony Strangis (who previously operated as “Shane Fox”). Before anyone really knew what was happening, he’d convinced her that dog immortality could exist, and the two had shafted her employees for paychecks and soon began living the fugitive life. Her fall from grace led to hard time at Riker’s Island, and the show explores how it went down under the most bizarre of circumstances.\n17. Making A Murderer\nYear: 2015-2018\nStarring: Steven Avery, Brendan Dassey\nGenre: Docuseries\nRating: TV-MA\nSeasons: 2 (20 episodes)\nDirector: Laura Ricciardi, Moira Demos\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.netflix.com/title/80000770\nThis series helped to kick off the current avalanche of true-crime streaming content, and for good reason. Viewers relished the chance to\noffer input while sleuthing their way to new clues on the Teresa Halbach murder. The Steven Avery and Brandon Dassey trials captivated millions upon millions of Netflix users who dove into a rabbit hole over old and new evidence alike, and the genre would never be the same again. As well, this series inspired filmmakers and streaming services to consider and execute several spins on true crime, and we’re seeing the results spread far throughout his list.\n18. Reality\nYear: 2023\nStarring: Sydney Sweeney, Josh Hamilton, Marchánt Davis\nGenre: True crime dramatization\nRating: TV-MA\nRuntime: 83 minutes\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.hbo.com/movies/reality\nSydney Sweeney portrays Reality Winner, whose name once attracted as much attention as the prison sentence that she received. The Air Force vet and former NSA translator was a 25-year-old fitness instructor living an uneventful life when FBI agents descended upon her home. The FBI’s actual transcript fuels this film’s dialogue to show what transpired between agents and the accused, and Sweeney begins by toeing the line on whether Reality leaked information about 2016 election interference by Russia to the press. The Euphoria actress’ skills are showcased in a different way than you’ve seen before now, as a seemingly ordinary 20-something whose life will forever be transformed. It’s a fascinating, tension-filled watch as Sweeney\npainstakingly parcels out a career-defining performance, and the walls close in around a doomed whistleblower.\n19. Love & Death\nYear: 2023\nStarring: Elizabeth Olsen, Jesse Plemons, Lily Rabe, Krysten Ritter\nGenre: Drama series\nRating: TV-MA\nSeasons: 1 (7 episodes)\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.hbomax.com/series/love-and-death\nThe second Candy Montgomery series (see also Hulu’s Candy) proves that the ax-murdering adulterer is having a bit of a moment. As well, David E. Kelley seldom misses, somehow turning a gruesome crime story into a riveting piece of entertainment with disturbingly good performances by Elizabeth Olsen and Jesse Plemons as the two-timing spouses. They are both fantastic at being awful, but Krysten Ritter chews up all the Texas scenery as sides line up for and against the character of Candy Montgomery in the face of an undeniable truth: she killed Betty Gore, portrayed with every ounce of available anxiety by Lily Rabe. This story never pretends otherwise, but Tom Pelphrey’s character milks his courtroom performance in a bid to be the Slimiest TV Lawyer Of The Year. Overall, this is an immersive experience, and you might feel like you are right there in the (miserable) church choir while a horrible soap opera unfolds. Many people are looking for that missing puzzle piece in life, but this group of people clearly went down the wrong path while doing so.\n20. Murder in Big Horn\nYear: 2023\nRating: MA\nSeasons: 1 (3 episodes)\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.sho.com/murder-in-big-horn\nMartin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon may be running far behind the original schedule, but this series adopts the same somber theme. This three-part docuseries charts the longstanding epidemic of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women in Big Horn County, Montana. Through in-depth interviews of Native families and local law enforcement, Native journalists persist in seeking enough information to secure a rare arrest in these cases. What emerges is a powerful and stirring portrait of communities that hopes to heal long-lasted wounds of grieving families, who have been attempting to seek the truth for centuries on end.\n21. Unsolved Mysteries (Revival)\nYear: 2020-2022\nStarring: The ghost of Robert Stack\nGenre: Docuseries\nRating: TV-MA\nSeasons: 3 (21 episodes)\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.netflix.com/title/81026055\nObviously, we’re dealing with a revival here (the original series ran for 14 years and bounced between networks), and this series hasn’t made a huge headline-making splash like other entries on this list, but this is still true-crime bread and butter and impossible to ignore. These quietly-executed episodes\nstay compelling like the original while inviting audience participation by anyone who has clues on how to solve these crimes. The ghost of former full-time host Robert Stack looms large, and the original creators (Cosgrove/Meurer Productions) teamed up with the Stranger Things production company (21 Laps Entertainment) to bring us a product that feels both fresh and faithful to its predecessor.\n22. Wild Wild Country\nYear: 2018\nStarring: Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh\nGenre: Docuseries\nRating: TV-MA\nSeasons: 1 (6 episodes)\nDirectors: Maclain Way, Chapman Way\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.netflix.com/title/80145240\nMark and Jay Duplass helmed this limited series that dives into a 1980s Oregon ruckus between ranchers and a cult leader, Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh. Actually, this series revisits the first bioterror attack on U.S. soil, in which over 750 people were poisoned with salmonella, and that’s only the beginning of the madness that transpired. In the end, the show digs into the FBI’s crusade to stop the Rajneeshees and their thousands of followers from causing more mayhem with comparisons to the Jonestown Massacre flying along with incidents of sketching wiretapping. It’s just nuts, man, but the limited series offers a lot of insight into future church-and-state collisions and honestly makes the Heaven’s Gate happenings seem moderate in comparison.\n23. The Staircase (Dramatization)\nYear: 2022\nStarring: Colin Firth, Toni Collette, Sophie Turner, Patrick Schwarzenegger\nGenre: Drama series\nRating: TV-MA\nSeasons: 1 (8 episodes)\nDirector: Antonio Campos, Leigh Janiak\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.hbomax.com/series/urn:hbo:series:GYk93MwWuH4BJoAEAAABu\nThis dramatization of the Michael Peterson story (previously covered in Jean-Xavier de Lestrade’s docuseries, which is our #1 pick) had a lot to prove, and it\njustified its own existence in spades. Colin Firth taught a master class in keeping the audience wondering about his character’s motives, which were seemingly muddled by his contradictory personality traits and his slightest of wavering expressions. Toni Collette went to extreme lengths to reenact speculative theories on how Kathleen could have died, and so much could have gone wrong during the most brutal scenes. However, the HBO series managed to respectfully wrap its hands around her memory while also considering the forensics of Kathleen’s autopsy report. The owl theory also receives its day in the sun, but ultimately, this series does well by treating Kathleen as a person, and a wife and a mother, not a chalkboard drawing in a crime scene.\n24. Boston Strangler\nYear: 2023\nStarring: Kiera Knightley, Carrie Coon\nGenre: True crime dramatization\nRating: TV-MA\nRuntime: 112 minutes\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.hulu.com/movie/boston-strangler-323eae40-5c62-4765-949a-5b4f7f8f2ba4?entity_id=323eae40-5c62-4765-949a-5b4f7f8f2ba4\nKeira Knightley and Carrie Coon star pick up journalist roles in a film that sheds light on the inherent misogyny behind the violent crimes at the center of this notorious serial killer story. In the process, they also battle a few similarly-themed obstacles while attempting to bring this story to justice. Somehow as well, their dogged investigative dives not only found opposition from law enforcement but also their own profession, and this project delivers a scathing view of how this city’s 1960s victims were viewed by those in true power.\n25. Pam & Tommy\nYear: 2022\nStarring: Lily James, Sebastian Stan, Nick Offerman, Seth Rogen\nGenre: Drama series\nRating: TV-MA\nSeasons: 1 (8 episodes)\nDirector: Craig Gillespie\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.hulu.com/series/pam-tommy-78839250-a41a-4899-b8da-500ca59a4196\nAs much fun as this show was — and it was overall a freaking blast — it’s\neasy to forget that the central crime of this show led to a lot of emotional devastation. Pamela Anderson endured many years of ongoing public humiliation after real intimate moments got captured on tape and stolen and distributed to the masses. Director Craig Gillespie had the unenviable task of balancing the rock-and-roll spirit of this project with showcasing all of the Pamela fallout during this dramatization. And although the subject herself was not onboard with this project, Lily James rightfully earned accolades by going to a dark place to dredge up those feelings as the show also frivolously tossed mullets around like it ain’t no big deal.\n26. Extremely Wicked Shockingly Evil And Vile\nYear: 2019\nStarring: Zac Efron, Lily Collins\nGenre: True crime dramatization\nRating: TV-MA\nRuntime: 110 minutes\nDirector: Joe Berlinger\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.netflix.com/title/81028570\nBefore Evan Peters was skewing the hell out of the Netflix audience in Dahmer, Zac Efron delivered a disarmingly charming performance as Ted Bundy. Joe Berlinger, who subsequently turned the true-crime genre on its head with Netflix’s Crime Scene series, directed this dramatization about a serial killer who flourished underneath everyone’s nose, and that includes his own family. Seeing Efron fully out of his usual element will spook you, and Lily Collins similarly treads into disturbing territory as Ted’s girlfriend who goes through hell in her own way.\n27. Atlanta’s Missing And Murdered: The Lost Children\nYear: 2020\nGenre: Docuseries\nRating: TV-MA\nSeasons: 1 (5 episodes)\nDirector: Maro Chermayeff, Sam Pollard\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.hbomax.com/series/urn:hbo:series:GXnTGcQWYDaFYqQEAAARN\nThis one’s a\nnecessary exploration of the 1979 to 1981 years in Atlanta, where 30+ African-American children/young adults either went missing or were discovered to have been murdered. Law enforcement swiftly pinned down a suspect and declared the case to be closed, but they moved far too rashly. Dozens of families never received the answers they sought, and racial tensions quickly rose to a boil during a time when the city hoped to become a Southern mecca of commerce and culture. This case’s twisted legacy unfurls at the hands of filmmakers Maro Chermayeff and Sam Pollard.\n28. Murdaugh Murders: A Southern Scandal\nYear: 2023\nGenre: Documentary\nRating: TV-MA\nSeasons: 1 (3 episodes)\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.netflix.com/title/81519789\nThis\nNetflix series timed itself impeccably, given that it released at around the same time of the real-life trial that ended with formerly prominent attorney and disgraced heir Alex Murdaugh convicted of murder. That trial recently ended, and a verdict came swiftly regarding the deaths of Alex’s son and wife, and this series aims to take a hard look at the evidence, along with damage control from the defendant, who may have been financially motivated, at the very least. The series also takes a grim look at the legal system and those who know how to (again, allegedly) manipulate it from within their own sordid stories.\n29. Black Bird\nYear: 2022\nStarring: Taron Egerton, Ray Liotta, Paul Walter Hauser, Greg Kinnear\nGenre: True crime dramatization\nRating: TV-MA\nSeasons: 1 (6 episodes)\nCreator: Dennis Lehane\nTrailer:\nhttps://tv.apple.com/us/show/black-bird/\nThis limited series brings us one of Ray Liotta’s final onscreen appearances, and yes, you’ll soon see him in the flat-out crazy\n Cocaine Bear, but first, prepare yourself for six hours of flat-out intensity. Liotta portrays Big Jim Keene, a veteran cop and dad to Taron Egerton’s Jimmy in this Dennis Lehane-produced adaptation of Jimmy’s In With The Devil: A Fallen Hero, A Serial Killer, and A Dangerous Bargain for Redemption memoir. The drug-dealing Jimmy does end up in hell, meaning that he takes an FBI deal to go undercover at a max-security prison, where he ends up tangling with Larry Hall, a suspected serial killer played by Paul Walter Hauser. Surely, you’ve seen his work before, and he’s at his unsettling best in this unyieldingly tense series that never takes its foot off the gas.\n30. John Wayne Gacy: Devil In Disguise\nYear: 2021\nGenre: Docuseries\nRating: TV-14\nSeasons: 1 (6 episodes)\nDirector: Rod Blackhurst\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.peacocktv.com/stream-tv/john-wayne-gacy-devil-in-disguise\nThis docuseries is as disturbing as can expect due to subject matter, but more than that, director Rod Blackhurst (Amanda Knox, which is further down this list) made it a mission to also (slightly) drag the true crime genre while exploring a notorious serial killer. As Blackhurst\ntold Indiewire, “I have always struggled with the way that true crime continues to be commodified.” He further made good on his intention to add something other than salaciousness to this project, which culminates after a full decade of work from a pair of independent journalists, Alison True and Tracy Ullman. What emerges is a wide-ranging exploration that, among other goals, exposes flaws in the criminal justice system that led Gacy’s own victims to be sidelined in news coverage. Let’s just say that the end result is haunting in more ways than one.\n31. Rest In Power: The Trayvon Martin Story\nYear: 2018\nGenre: Docuseries\nRating: TV-MA\nSeasons: 1 (6 episodes)\nDirectors: Jenner Furst, Julia Willoughby Nason\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.paramountplus.com/shows/rest-in-power-the-trayvon-martin-story/\nThis essential watch ends up being a portrait of the times that we live in today. The docuseries charts the horrible tragedy of Trayvon Martin’s death at the hand of George Zimmerman, and how the subsequent fallout launched a series of ongoing debates about how police responded and how the prosecution struggled against societal forces including race in America. As well, the project charts the burgeoning Black Lives Matter movement and points towards much work to be done, including on the issues of gun violence and how much of an uphill battle is still faced by marginalized communities who seek justice with devastating results.\n32. The Watcher\nYear: 2022\nStarring: Bobby Cannavale, Naomi Watts, Margo Martindale, Mia Farrow, Jennifer Coolidge\nGenre: Drama series\nRating: TV-MA\nSeasons: 1 (7 episodes)\nDirector: Ryan Murphy, Paris Barclay, Jennifer Lynch, Max Winkler\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.netflix.com/title/81380441\nThis is not an objectively good series. Few people are arguing that point, but Ryan Murphy has (again) pulled together some\ncompelling TV, and you gotta respect that game. Bobby Cannavale does the most as a patriarch who slowly comes undone as a mystery entity terrorizes his family with unsettling letters, and Naomi Watts keeps everyone guessing until the very end. Jennifer Coolidge is typically fantastic as a realtor who damn well should have known to disclose this house’s issues. The show is gloriously full of red herrings while adding flavor to the already mind-boggling investigative report from The Cut, and all of the potential suspects appear to have a delightful time with claiming and ducking responsibility. Despite the potentially triggering subject matter, this still happens to be a playful series with more to come.\n33. Mindhunter\nYear: 2017-2019\nStarring:\nGenre: Drama series\nRating: TV-MA\nSeasons: 2 (19 episodes)\nDirectors: David Fincher, Carl Franklin, Andrew Dominik, Asif Kapadia, Tobias Lindholm, Andrew Douglas\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.netflix.com/title/80114855\nHere’s an example of a guilty pleasure that true crime viewers don’t have to feel even slightly guilty about watching. If you haven’t yet experienced this David Fincher-helmed series, you have an array of (fictionalized) serial killers awaiting you. Damon Herriman picks up Charles Manson (he also portrayed the cult leader for Quentin Tarantino), and takes on Dennis Rader, David Berkowitz, Ed Kemper, Monte Rissell, Richard Speck, Wayne Williams, Jerry Brudos are also up for the sampling.\n34. The Landscapers\nYear: 2021\nStarring: David Thewlis, Olivia Colman\nGenre: Drama series\nRating: TV-MA\nSeasons: 1 (4 episodes)\nDirector: Will Sharpe\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.hbomax.com/series/urn:hbo:series:GYXhZlwhBpMI_wwEAAAfU\nWill Sharpe (yes, the same dude who played pouting, stormy Ethan in The White Lotus) directed this offbeat “love story” about a pair of apparently ordinary Britons who may or may not have something to do with dead bodies found in their back yard. Olivia Colman and David Thewlis star in a story that’s anything but expected when it comes to tone. This won’t be everyone’s cup of tea, but the project’s collective talent (onscreen and off) is immense, and several of the parts end up being worth more than the total sum of where this story goes.\n35. Night Stalker: The Hunt For a Serial Killer\nYear: 2021\nGenre: Docuseries\nRating: TV-MA\nSeasons: 1 (4 episodes)\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.netflix.com/title/81025701\nThis spellbinding docuseries dives deep into the investigation of brutal serial killer Richard Ramirez, who terrorized Los Angeles in the mid 1980s. Law enforcement found themselves puzzled by Ramirez’s apparent lack of rhyme or reason, given that his series of murders and sexual assaults at first appeared to be disconnected. After round-the-clock work by the members of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, breaks in the case eventually arrived, and this series seeks to paint a portrait of how citizens feared becoming the next victim in this real-life horror story.\n36. Dateline\nYear: 1992 –\nStarring: Lester Holt, Keith Morrison, Andrea Canning, Josh Mankiewicz, Ann Curry, Stone Phillips\nGenre: News, documentary\nRating: TV-MA\nSeasons: 31 seasons (2720+ episodes)\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.peacocktv.com/watch-online/tv/dateline-nbc/9060582955933764112\nOne would be remiss to not consider this long-running series’ place within America’s fascination with the true crime genre. For nearly two decades, this mainstay always seems to be around when a true-crime junkie needs a quick fix, and the show has captivatingly shown the at-home audience what happens with the doors are blown off cold cases with drastic results. If you never did catch this show in its Friday night time slot, there’s always syndication and streaming to make Stone Phillips happen again.\n37. Tiger King\nYear: 2020\nStarring: Joe Exotic, Carole Baskin, a bunch of big cats\nGenre: Docuseries\nRating: TV-MA\nSeasons: 2 (12 episodes)\nDirectors: Eric Goode, Rebecca Chaiklin\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.netflix.com/title/81115994\nObviously, this show is not high art, but it did turn into a sensation during the early days of the pandemic. It also happened to be content that few could resist during a dearth of other fresh options, but the series was entertaining, Big Cat people are in a league of their own in terms of exploitative bad deeds, and the show dives into the world of Joe Exotic, rival Carole Baskin, and a dastardly murder-for-hire scheme that landed the former behind bars in real life. Also, there’s a whole array of odd supporting characters, and some really bad music videos to boot. Yeehaw.\n38. The Lady And The Dale\nYear: 2021\nStarring: Liz Carmichael\nGenre: Docuseries\nRating: TV-14\nSeasons: 1 (4 episodes)\nDirector: Nick Cammilleri, Zackary Drucker\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.hbomax.com/series/urn:hbo:series:GX_TWBgQpQK6_lAEAAAAC\nRoom 104 duo Mark and Jay Duplass stick with HBO to present the story of Elizabeth Carmichael, who promised the world with a fuel-efficient vehicle that was otherwise unheard of in the 1970s. From there, a mountain of intrigue eventually turned into an avalanche of exposed fraud that took her investors for a merciless ride. Interestingly enough, this series can be viewed as an auto-industry based precursor for what Theranos’ Elizabeth Holmes later pulled off (at least for awhile) with blood testing.\n39. Dr. Death\nYear: 2021\nStarring: Joshua Jackson, AnnaSophia Robb, Christian Slater, Edgar Ramirez, and Alec Baldwin\nGenre: Drama series\nRating: TV14\nSeasons: 2 (16 episodes) and more to come\nDirectors: Stephen Frears, Maggie Kiley\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.peacocktv.com/stream-tv/dr-death\nJoshua Jackson stars as real life doom-neurologist Dr. Christopher Duntsch, whose terrifying reign of medical terror became the subject of a successful Wondery podcast. All told, dozens of Duntsch’s patients never recovered from their seemingly routine spinal surgeries, and it was up to two fellow surgeons, Robert Henderson (Alec Baldwin) and Randall Kirby (Christian Slater), to sound the alarm. Before all was said and done, prosecutor Michelle Shughart (AnnaSophia Robb) fought like hell to stop Duntsch, and this docuseries takes a lengthy look at the man behind the surgeon’s mask and the tragic circumstances surrounding a system that potentially allowed a predator to flourish.\n40. Crime Scene: The Texas Killing Fields\nYear: 2022\nGenre: True crime documentary\nRating: TV-MA\nSeasons: 1 (3 episodes)\nCreator: Joe Berlinger\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.netflix.com/title/81555750\nNot too many bread-and-butter true crime series rose to the top of the crop this year, but the latest entry in Joe Berlinger’s Crime Scene made the grade. Berlinger’s anthology series revolves around settings as central characters that (arguably) aid and abet the flourishing of violent crimes. And as\nwith the Cecil Hotel, there’s definitely a vibe that helps one understand why the so-called “Texas Killing Fields” were plenty spooky enough before bodies were discovered. In this case, Calder Road (part of the marshy surroundings between Galveston and Houston) turned into a focal point connected to the disappearance of four young women, whose murders remain cold cases to this day. This series traces decades of history tied to Calder Road’s ominous vibe, led by one grieving father who’s still searching for the truth.\n41. Don’t F**k With Cats: Hunting An Internet Killer\nYear: 2019\nGenre: Docuseries\nRating: TV-MA\nSeasons: 1 (3 episodes)\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.netflix.com/title/81031373\nThe title of this series sounds like an Internet meme gone incredibly wrong, but the real story runs darker. A major trigger warning is in order for instances of animal cruelty and, just like the title indicates, amateur sleuths do team up to take down a maniac. If you’re expecting something as (relatively) light as Tiger King, then you’ll be a little shook, but it’s certainly a different type of true crime series than you’ll find on the rest of the list.\n42. In Ice Cold Blood\nYear: 2018 – 2019\nGenre: Docuseries\nStarring: Ice-T\nRating: TV-MA\nSeasons: 2 (24 episodes)\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.peacocktv.com/watch-online/tv/in-ice-cold-blood/8775404034369539112\nIce-T portrays a cop on TV, and he’s done so for over 20 years in procedural territory for Law & Order: SVU. Here, the\nfrequent rocker does his best Robert Stack to present true stories of sex, sugar daddies, money, mayhem, and murder. National landmarks rear their heads in some episodes, and double lives catch up with people (sometimes alongside high-speed chases) before investigators work to unravel the tragic events that transpire.\n43. Painkiller: The Tylenol Murders\nYear: 2023\nGenre: Docuseries\nRating: TV-MA\nSeasons: 1 (5 episodes)\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.paramountplus.com/shows/painkiller-the-tylenol-murders/\nIn the early 1980s, nightly news reports were awash of terror lurking on store aisles when someone laced Tylenol capsules with cyanide. As a result, seven people died in Chicago, and the mystery of whodunnit still remains unsolved. This docuseries does follow the manhunt, which centered on potential suspect James Lewis, but he was never arrested, and boy, you are in for a real time capsule of a dubious adventure while watching this.\n44. Inventing Anna\nYear: 2021\nStarring: Julia Garner\nGenre: Drama series\nRating: TV-MA\nSeasons: 1 (9 episodes)\nDirectors: David Frankel, Tom Verica, Daisy von Scherler Mayer, Nzingha Stewart, Ellen Kuras\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.netflix.com/title/81008305\nA whole lot of grifter-focused series surfaced this year, but\nJulia Garner raised all the eyebrows as the unusually-accented German-Russian-WTF fake heiress Anna Delvey. The dramatizations are hefty, and at least one of Delvey’s real-life victims sued over how this series portrayed her. In the end, however, Jessica Pressler’s original character study of Delvey receives the confounding adaptation that it deserves. People almost desperately wanted to believe in Delvey’s twisted version of the American Dream, and the rest is gravy-coated fallout.\n45. Murder in Boston: Roots, Rampage & Reckoning\nYear: 2023\nGenre: Docuseries\nRating: TV-MA\nSeasons: 1 (3 episodes)\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.max.com/shows/murder-in-boston-roots-rampage-reckoning/68af2b13-0855-4d8f-aca4-040802d63fcb\nTrue-crime junkies can get an end-of-year fix with this deep dive into an infamous Boston homicide that terrorized a neighborhood and also ignited long-standing racial tensions in the community. A series of wide-ranging family and law enforcement interviews, old and new, paint a different view of this case than has come to light in the public eye before now. Overall, this case illustrates why rushing to justice can work much more damage than when the wheels of justice do their typical (albeit frustrating) slow dance toward resolution.\n46. Desperately Seeking Soulmate: Escaping Twin Flames Universe\nYear: 2023\nGenre: Docuseries\nRating: TV-MA\nSeasons: 1 (3 episodes)\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Desperately-Seeking-Soulmate-Escaping-Universe/dp/B0CG7C7N1C\nSadly, this docuseries does not have anything to do with Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly’s\ndrama-filled relationship, but it’s nonetheless an engrossing albeit disturbing watch. The action follows a journalist’s online trip into the “Twin Flames Universe,” which is run by two souls who claim that title. And what transpires is a cautionary tale that happens to also be covered in a Netflix series called Escaping True Flames, if you can’t get enough of this mess.\n47. The Girl From Plainville\nYear: 2022\nStarring: Elle Fanning, Chloë Sevigny, and Colton Ryan\nGenre: Drama miniseries\nSeasons: 1 (8 episodes)\nDirector(s): Lisa Cholodenko, Zetna Fuentes, Pippa Bianco, Liz Hannah, Daniel Minahan\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.hulu.com/series/the-girl-from-plainville-b23dbb07-5a56-4918-8a17-a0cbe18d7884\nThis limited series set out to do the seemingly impossible: to dramatize an incredibly sensational true-crime story without heading straight into exploitative territory. To those who frequent the Internet, the story’s skeleton will sound familiar enough: Michelle Carter was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the so-called “texting-suicide” case that involved the death of her boyfriend, Conrad “Coco” Roy III. The series takes its name and its basis from Jesse Barron’s 2017 Esquire\nsame-named investigative report, which detailed how Carter admitted to instructing the suicidal Roy to “get back in” after he began to be overwhelmed by exhaust fumes from his vehicle. Elle Fanning takes on the tough role of Carter while the show dives into the real-life texts that filled their two-year relationship. It didn’t look great from the get-go and didn’t improve, but the show looks beyond the headlines and the messages themselves to dig into what brought Carter and Roy to that pivotal point and the wreckage that followed.\n48. Amanda Knox\nYear: 2016\nGenre: Documentary\nRating: TV-MA\nRuntime: 91 minutes\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.netflix.com/title/80081155\nFormer college-exchange student Amanda Knox went through hell and back a few times as her time in Italy led to a murder case watched around the globe. In the end, Knox endured two convictions and murder, and she (along with many who worked on the case) tells her story in feature-length form here. What’s particularly chilling is how this project easily dismantles what turned out to be a shoddily-built case by Italian authorities and prosecutors amid a sea of sensationalism and public pressure to nail a killer.\n49. Homicide For The Holidays\nYear: 2016 –\nGenre: Docuseries\nRating: TV-MA\nSeasons: 5 (27 episodes)\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.peacocktv.com/watch-online/tv/homicide-for-the-holidays/7041629268650962112\nSure, the holidays aren’t entirely pleasant for anyone whose aunts or uncles insist upon being confrontational nuisances. People do tend to get on each other’s nerves about politics or sports when gathering for too much turkey, but unfortunately, tensions can get out of control with outcomes akin to a horror movie. This obviously is not a warm and fuzzy holiday watch, although it might make you hug your loved ones a little bit tighter the next time you gather.\nTIE: 50. Till Murder Do Us Part: Soering vs. Haysom\nYear: 2023\nGenre: Docuseries\nRating: TV-MA\nSeasons: 1 (4 episodes)\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.netflix.com/title/81445995\nThis project presents newly revealed tidbits that raise questions surrounding the 1985 deaths of two parents, whose daughter was dating Jens Söring. He was convicted of the deaths, but was she involved as well, or did she actually do the killing on her own? Sit down for this one.\nTIE: 50. Get Gotti\nYear: 2023\nGenre: Docuseries\nRating: TV-MA\nSeasons: 1 (3 episodes)\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.netflix.com/title/81628150\nThe Fear City gang got together to do a deep dive on John Gotti for the people who haven’t seen all those documentaries from years past. Or his family’s reality shows, for that matter. This docuseries, however, takes glimpses from opposing sides of the legal system, but eventually, yeah, one side won, and that would be the FBI. This one engrossed the Netflix audience for a few weeks, so it’s definitely worth a whirl even if you have already brushed up on this mafioso’s history.",
