The fan posted a childhood picture of Osimhen wearing a Blues jersey, begging him to come and save the club from their poor performances.\nYou can watch the post and Osimhen's response below:\nOsimhen's response. Osimhen has been linked with a move to the west London side for a while via Football.London. Rumors of the Nigerian leaving the club intensified earlier this year after the club's official TikTok posted two videos seemingly mocking him.\nMeanwhile, Chelsea have experienced mediocre play from both their strikers, Nicolas Jackson and Armando Broja this season. Although the Senegalese forward has seven goals in the league, he has been inconsistent and guilty of missing many simple chances.\nBroja, meanwhile, has returned from an ACL injury he suffered last year but is yet to make an impression. Summer signing Christopher Nkunku also suffered an injury in pre-season and has recently returned to action.\nOsimhen has made it well-known that he is a big fan of Chelsea legend Didier Drogba. He said on John Obi Mikel's The Obi One Podcast in November:\n\"I had two jersey's from my brother when I was a kid - Chelsea and Manchester United. When I was playing grassroots [I was compared to Didier Drogba]. We used to use my brothers phone [to watch Drogba]. I would then go on the pitch and try to [emulate] at his game [and learn]. I still watch Drogba's comps now.\" Osimhen has scored seven goals and provided two assists in 13 Serie A games for Napoli this season.",
