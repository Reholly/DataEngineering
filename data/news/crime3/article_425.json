Charanjit Singh Atwal recently found a wallet and $8,000 in cash scattered across the back seat of his taxi. Instead of keeping the cash, the Sikh driver immediately handed it over to the police so they could locate the rightful owner. The honest taxi driver said it never crossed his mind to keep the money. Surprisingly, the rightful owner was reunited with his cash. Mr. Singh Atwal did not ask for any reward from the grateful owner. Charanjit Singh Atwal recently found $8,000 in the back seat of his taxi ‘No no. I do not need it. Never ever,’ said the 13cabs driver. nine news . He told the Herald Sun: ‘I remember the passenger who lost him was in a hurry; He was very lucky because he had many passengers behind him. “Needless to say, I was very grateful.” Australians were quick to praise the taxi driver after his story was posted online and went viral. ‘A good and honest man. This says a lot about his character. May he be blessed abundantly,’ wrote one. “He is blessed and his honesty and good deed will be returned to him tenfold,” said one. ‘Yeah! Great morals, great ethics! Respect,” wrote another. Others were disappointed to learn that the owner of the cash did not give a reward to Mr Singh Atwal. ‘No reward? What an idiot,” one wrote. “The man obviously has a good heart and probably wasn’t expecting a reward, but it’s disappointing that the owner of the money didn’t bless him with one,” said another. Some were more cynical. “Let’s face it, there was a camera in the car and he knew that if he kept the money he would lose his job or worse, be prosecuted,” one wrote. “If he hadn’t, he could have been charged with theft,” said another.
