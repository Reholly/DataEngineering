    "text": "Kogi State Police Command, on Friday, said the bandits terrorising Lokoja/Ajaokuta road have been dispatched by the security forces.\nRecall that on Thursday afternoon, some bandits took over Lokoja/Ajaokuta road trying to kidnap motorists plying along the road.\nSpeaking with Tribune Online on Friday, the Kogi State Command Public Relations Officer SP William Ayah said the incident happened yesterday Thursday at about 3 pm.\nAccording to him, passengers travelling along Lokoja/Ajaokuta road were hinted by a good Samaritan that some bandits had taken over the road waiting to kidnap travellers, so they quickly moved to the closest town to avoid being Kidnapped and made distress call to the Police Command.\nHowever, when the information got to Command, the State Commissioner of Police CP Bethrand Onuoha quickly dispatched Rapid Response Unit to the area who dispatched the criminals into to bush.\nHe further disclosed no passenger was kidnapped due to quick response of the unit adding that the road was finally open for motorists travelling along the road.\nYOU SHOULD NOT MISS THESE HEADLINES FROM\n NIGERIAN TRIBUNE Primate Ayodele releases 91-page prophecy for 2024\nThe leader Of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele has released his prophecies for 2024 as it is…\nNIMC issues new guidelines for date of birth modification\nThe National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) has issued new guidelines for the modification of…\nSen Natasha spreads Christmas cheer with generous palliatives in Kogi Central\nIn commemoration of Christmas and New Year celebrations, Senator Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan (Kogi Central), has put smiles on…\nFive Nigerian musicians who had the biggest hit songs in 2023\nNigeria’s music industry had a remarkable year, with talented singers and hit songs making…\nHistory will judge me, I gave Nigeria my best as ‘president,’ IBB declares\nFormer military president, General Ibrahim Babangida (IBB) has said history will judge him as leader of the country for…\nAnthony Joshua beats Otto Wallin in five rounds\nAnthony Joshua delivered one of his best displays in recent memory with an impressive stoppage of Otto Wallin in…",
