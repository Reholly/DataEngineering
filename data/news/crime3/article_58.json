    "text": "OAKLAND — The 8th annual Police Providing Presents event took place in Garrett County on Dec. 16. This event was made possible through the collaboration of volunteers from four law enforcement agencies in Garrett County, along with the Garrett County Department of Social Services, Garrett County Board of Education and Garrett County Health Department. Although this event may have different names across the country, its purpose remains the same. The event aims to provide selected children from Garrett County Schools with the opportunity to spend the day with members of various law enforcement agencies, including the Maryland State Police, Garrett County Sheriff’s Office, Maryland Natural Resource Police and the Maryland State Fire Marshal’s Office. The event kicked off with the officers picking up their assigned partners for the day, and together they went shopping for gifts at the Oakland Walmart. Later, a luncheon with various activities was held at the Garrett County Fairgrounds. These activities included demonstrations of fire trucks and ambulances, as well as ornament making, cookie decorating, and interactive games. Volunteers wrapped the purchased gifts during these activities, ensuring that the children could take them home to their families. The organizers expressed gratitude to the Garrett County Department of Social Services for its partnership since the inception of Police Providing Presents, as well as continued support for the program each year. Additionally, the group extended thanks to the Garrett County Public Schools for assistance in selecting the children who participated in this event. Special thanks goes to Oakland Walmart, Garrett County Fair Board, Crossroads Church, Deep Creek Fire Department, Garrett County Emergency Services, Little Caesars (Grantsville), Ledo Pizza, Pizza Hut, Subway (Oakland Walmart), Arrowhead Market, Penn Alps Restaurant, McDonald’s (Deep Creek Lake), Wisp Resort, Funland, Monkey Business Adventure Park, Katie’s Ice Cream, Marissa Mullenax Bakery, Samantha Funding the Arts, Utz (Cumberland) and Total Biz Fulfillment. “We would also like to acknowledge and thank the numerous businesses and individuals who generously made donations,” a spokesperson said. “It is because of your support that this event was a tremendous success!” Gratitude was expressed to the following establishments for their generous contributions to the annual 2023 Police Providing Presents event, as well as all the individuals who made donations towards the program.
