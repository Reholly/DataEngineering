    "text": "A 36-year-old techie latched on to the speeding scooter of a robber who had snatched his phone and clung to it for nearly 150 metres recently near Town Hall, before the culprit lost control of his vehicle and fell down. The techie, with help from passersby, caught him.Sangamesh, who resides in RPC Layout near Vijaya Nagar and works in a firm at Sarjapur, sustained injuries on his knees and hand. The accused - Syed Athik, 23, from Tipu Nagar in Chamarajpet - was thrashed by the public before being handed over to police. Athik is a dropout and a habitual offender, police said.On December 26, while waiting for his friend at the bus stop on NR Road at 7.15pm, Sangamesh took out his phone to call a family member. Before the call got connected, scooter-borne Athik stopped next to him and snatched the phone. \\\"As he tried to escape, I held on to the scooter's seat handle to stop him. The miscreant raised the accelerator and dragged me for more than 150 metres towards KR Market. People shouted at him and started running behind the vehicle. He lost balance and fell on the road. I immediately got up and went to him. People came to my help and they caught him,\\\" Sangamesh said.He said he didn't want the culprit to escape at any cost. \\\"But later, I realised if he had taken the BGS flyover, I would have been run over. Another stroke of luck was that the vehicles coming from Town Hall junction towards KR Market had stopped as the signal had turned red. So the road was empty,\\\" he said. Athik had tampered with his scooter's number plates and was wearing a mask to avoid being detected. He suffered knee injury in the fall.",
