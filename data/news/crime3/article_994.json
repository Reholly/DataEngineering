    "text": "HAYDEN, Idaho - A dog stolen in north Idaho on Christmas has been found in eastern Washington. Just two days ago, Liberty Lake police located and returned Jack, the Cairn Terrier, to his owner, according to Lynn Pehrson, the animal's owner. Pehrson also added that getting the dog back would not have been possible without the support he felt from the community.\n\"I started out as an army of one and turned into an army of a thousand and ten thousand in a matter of hours,\" Pehrson said.\nAccording to Pehrson, an anonymous source was staying at the Best Western in Liberty Lake when they saw a dog that looked like one he had seen on a missing dog poster. This man then called Pehrson's daughter, who confirmed the dog he was looking at was in fact, Jack. Lynn Pehrson then went to the hotel and, with help from the police, was able to get the dog back from the woman who stole him, who Pehrson says is the dog's previous owner.\nPehrson's daughter had bought the dog from the woman on Facebook marketplace for $400 four years ago.\nBetween a woman who stopped in the middle of the road to call 911 after the dog was stolen, to the anonymous caller who first saw Jack in Liberty Lake, and even to a veterinarian who stayed open late so they could confirm Jack's identity, the entire community stepped up to lend a helping hand.\n\"It breathes life for believing and bringing faith back into man, and back into the common man. And were helping one another and looking out for one another. And that's what it's about. Thank you,\" said Pehrson.\nJack was a little shaken up at first when he returned home with the family, but has adjusted to being the dog the Pehrson knows and loves.\nThe Pehrson's hope that justice is served in the case of their stolen dog, but are moving forward as a reunited family.",
