As a result of these findings, Cerebral is required to pay $540,000 in restitution to more than 16,500 New Yorkers and must revamp its cancellation process to be more user-friendly.\n“Making New Yorkers withstand stressful and extended delays to cancel a subscription for mental health care coverage is unacceptable,” said James. “It is illegal and unfair to make consumers spend extra time or jump through hoops to try to cancel a subscription they no longer need.”\nThis sentiment echoes her recent action against SiriusXM, where she sued the company for trapping consumers in subscriptions with a deliberately lengthy and burdensome cancellation process. The lawsuit against SiriusXM sought restitution and penalties for violations of New York’s business laws.\nCerebral, known for providing virtual mental health treatment services, came under scrutiny after consumers reported difficulties in canceling their subscriptions. The OAG found that the company exploited the delay in cancellation processing to issue additional charges, including billing consumers for another month’s service when the delay crossed over into a new billing cycle.\nThe settlement also includes $200,000 in penalties and requires Cerebral to establish a simpler “click-to-cancel” process. Additionally, the company must limit its attempts to retain subscribers to one attempt after an indication of intent to cancel has been made. Cerebral is to issue automatic refunds within 90 days to consumers who were improperly charged.\n“The law is clear that companies must make it easy and simple to end a subscription and my office will continue to hold them to that standard,” James said.\nLeave a Comment",
