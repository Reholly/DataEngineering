    "text": "Melissa Picariello of\nLife After Lockup spent over twenty years fantasizing about her high school crush, Louie Fojut. But now that she finally has the man of her dreams, she is running hot and cold with him, and he can’t figure out what to do next.\nLouie Fojut Grows Tired of Life After Lockup’s Melissa Picariello’s Games\nMelissa Picariello couldn’t wait to finally have Life After Lockup felon Louie Fojut all to herself. Initially, she knew his mom, Donna, would be a problem. Being an old-fashioned Italian mom, Donna worships the ground her son walks on. So she wants him to stay close by so she can ensure her baby boy is well cared for.\nDonna made it clear to Melissa Picariello that she didn’t like her. She believes Louie could do better. Melissa wants Louie to ditch his mom and move to New Jersey to be with her. Or at least that was what her original plan was. Now, she thinks it is a good idea for his mom to accompany him to New Jersey until he settles in.\nThis drives Life After Lockup star Louie Fojut crazy. One minute, Melissa is all for their relationship and starting a new life together sans his mom; next, she is telling him something completely different.\nBe Careful What You Wish For\nOnce again, Louie gives in to Melissa. He has been doing that lately because she has been pulling away from him. The WEtv couple has a long way to go if they want their relationship to work. But first and foremost, Louie Fojut wants Melissa Picariello to\nstop playing head games with him.\nLouie Fojut wants Melissa Picariello to stop playing head games with him. He feels he is doing everything she asks of him and doing it\nall her way. But regardless of what it is, it never seems enough to make her happy, and he is growing tired of his Life After Lockup girlfriend’s attitude. Now, she wants to spend thousands on plastic surgery for herself. This adds to the list of problems for them.\nMelissa’s dad has even threatened Louie. He informed Louie that he would take a ball bat to him if he did anything to hurt his daughter. This is kind of scary. Fans can’t wait to see the parents face off.\nSo far, Melissa Picariello has kept her Life After Lockup partner, Louie Fojut, wrapped around her little finger. But, if she pushes and tests his limits, she may find that her high school crush will leave her behind in the dust once and for all.",
