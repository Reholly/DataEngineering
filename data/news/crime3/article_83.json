    "text": "Jacinta Davila's murder charge droppedCharged with lesser offence of assisting an offenderREAD MORE: Inside the life of mum and dad accused of home invasion death\nA young Adelaide mum who was behind bars over the death of a renowned doctor has been immediately released on bail.\nJacinta Davila, 27 will spend Christmas at home with her eight-month-old son under home detention after her murder charge over the death of Dr Michael Yung death was dropped by prosecutors on Friday.\nProsecutors downgraded her charge to assisting an offender, an offence that still carries a significant legal punishment.\nDavila and her partner Kerem Aydin, 22, were initially both charged with murdering Dr Yung in a violent home invasion at Gilberton in Adelaide’s inner-north earlier in this month.\nMagistrate Michael Jandy had previously heard Davila’s DNA was found on a headtorch at the suspected entry point, adjacent to a fly screen that had been sliced open, while Aydin was linked to blood stains at the scene.\nJacinta Davila (right) will be at home for her baby son’s first Christmas after her murder charge was dropped by prosecutors\nDr Michael Yung (picture) was killed in a violent home invasion in Adelaide’s inner-north\nMs Davila walked free from Adelaide’s Women’s Prison on Friday after her murder charge over the death of Dr Michael Yung death was dropped by prosecutors\nWhile there was a relatively strong case that Davila had tampered with evidence by attempting to wash blood from clothing found at the couple’s Thebarton home, Mr Jandy said there was an obvious question mark surrounding the strength of evidence attaching her to the crime scene.\nAlthough Davila’s DNA was found at the Gilberton house, it could have transferred from her to the crime scene via Aydin, he said.\n‘Absent of any other evidence putting this defendant at the scene of the crime at the time, the case will remain possibly equivocal in relation to her,’ Mr Jandy told Adelaide Magistrates Court on December 13.\nMr Jandy allowed Davila to be released from Adelaide Women’s Prison on Friday after prosecutors said they would not oppose bail.\nDavila was released from Adelaide Women’s Prison on Friday after prosecutors said they would not oppose bail\nMs Davila’s lawyer Alexander Jackson (pictured on Friday ) told the court that keeping his client in custody throughout a lengthy trial would bring undue hardship on her baby boy\nJamila Davila (right) will be fitted with an electric monitoring device, surrender her passport and have no contact with her partner Kerem Aydin (left) as part of her strict bail conditions\nDavila will remain on home detention at a house in Mile End, where she will be able to look after her eight-month-old son.\nDavila sobbed and exhaled heavily with relief after being granted bail.\n‘Thank you so much,’ she told the judge via videolink.\nHer lawyer, Alexander Jackson, had earlier told the court that her client was effectively the baby’s sole carer and that remaining in custody throughout a lengthy trial would bring undue hardship on him.\nThe couple had unsuccessfully attempted co-parenting after the child was conceived during a one-night stand, he told the court.\nAs part of her bail conditions, Davila must be fitted with an electric monitoring device, relinquish her passport, avoid all contact with Aydin and only leave the house with the express approval of a corrections supervisor.\nJacinta Davila (left) wept after finding out she would immediately be released from custody. Her partner Kerem Aydin (right) remains behind bars charged with murder\nAydin remains charged with Dr Yung’s murder and trespassing with the intention to steal more than $30,000 worth of property.\nThe pair will return to court in March.\nDetectives were no longer seeking any other suspects for the alleged crime.\n“There has been no connection identified between the arrested people and those being sought for a recent crime spree across Adelaide,” police said.",
