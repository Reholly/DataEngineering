    "text": "Swift puncher, Sifon ‘Best’ Iwatt, on Tuesday won the Mojisola Ogunsanya Memorial Trophy and a cash prize of N2m for emerging the best boxer at GOtv Boxing Night 30.\nIwatt was a double winner on the night, as he produced a cracking performance that saw him clinch the first title of his professional career. He secured the national super flyweight title, courtesy of a unanimous decision victory over Saheed ‘Eagle’ Azeez.\nThe explosive six-bout event also saw national welterweight title holder, Taiwo ‘Gentle Boy’ Olowu, clinch the West African Boxing Union super welterweight title on the back of a split decision victory over hard-hitting Alidu ‘Dynamite’ Sulemana of Ghana.\nThe national bantamweight challenge bout between Arabambi Ojo and Ibrahim ‘Golden Boy’ Opeyemi ended in a draw, while Ahmed ‘Eshe’ Ganiyu knocked out Ayanfe ‘Battle Boy’ Adeoye in the fifth round of their national light welterweight bout.\nIn the national super welterweight category, Abdulafeez ‘Big Name’ Osoba, defeated Christopher Ucheji via a technical knockout, while national female cruiserweight champion, Bolatito ‘Black Tito’ Oluwole, secured another unanimous decision victory over her challenger, Blessing Abisoye, in a national female cruiserweight challenge fight.\nProvided by SyndiGate Media Inc.
