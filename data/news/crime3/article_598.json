    "text": "Kenneth S. Nugent, P.C., a personal injury law firm based in Savannah, GA, is ready to commit their resources to clients who wish to pursue a wrongful death claim. This civil action can be brought against any party who may be held liable for a loved one’s untimely passing. Learn more: Wrongful Death Lawyer Savannah .\nSavannah residents are advised to contact the firm today for a free legal consultation with an experienced wrongful death lawyer. This consultation will allow them to explore their options in full and make an informed choice regarding their next steps. Should the client wish to move forward, the firm will make their team’s expertise available until the case is resolved.\n“You pay nothing unless we win,” adds Kenneth S. Nugent, P.C. “We understand how terrible this time must be for you, and we will do everything in our power to take the burden of pursuing compensation off your shoulders. Instead, you can rely on us to investigate the circumstances that led to your loved one’s passing, following which we will negotiate for the largest compensation possible.”\nSuch negotiations have to be backed by evidence, which is why most will find it easier to win their case with the assistance of a wrongful death lawyer. In addition to knowing the intricacies of the legal system, a firm with resources similar to Kenneth S. Nugent, P.C. will have access to an expansive network of specialists, experts and so on who could help them determine the truth behind the accident or other incident which had fatal consequences.\nThe firm further points out that a death may not occur immediately. In some cases, a victim may receive medical care before they pass, and this will add to the immense financial burden their surviving family members will have to deal with, along with funeral arrangements and so on. In some cases, financial compensation can do more than alleviate the family’s financial concerns, it is necessary to support them. This can happen if the victim was the family’s sole or main income earner.\nWhatever the case may be, it is strongly recommended that survivors seek compensation if they have lost a loved one as the result of another party’s negligence. A wrongful death claim is also separate to criminal charges, and both may proceed independently if required.\nSavannah residents need only take a look at the experience others have had working with Kenneth S. Nugent, P.C. to determine if their assistance would be helpful. A former client shares, “I got seriously injured from a head-on collision. I was out of work, needed months of therapy, and my back pain was continuously hammering! Needing help, I reached out to several different law firms and fortunately was turned down by all of them.”\nThe client was then taken on by Kenneth S. Nugent, P.C. “Lauren Huffman stayed with me every step of the way and treated me like family,” explains the client. “It didn't matter how many questions I had or how many times I called Lauren on a weekly basis. Major progress has been made as easy and comfortable as possible. I highly recommend this law firm. 10 Stars!”\nThis review is far from the only example of the high praise the firm gets on a regular basis. “Amazing service,” says another client. “Was with me every step of the way, laid everything out and made sure, I was happy with the settlement, couldn't ask for anyone better. Kenneth Nugent and the Savannah team did an amazing job, and I'm pleased with the results. Thank you so much, would recommend to anyone who has been in any type of accident to give Kenneth Nugent and team a call.”\nThe team at Kenneth S. Nugent, P.C. - Savannah is standing by to talk to anyone who believes they may have a wrongful death case on their hands. A consultation can be scheduled with a single phone call. Kenneth S. Nugent, P.C. is also active on social media.\n###\nFor more information about Kenneth S. Nugent, P.C. - Savannah, contact the company here:\nKenneth S.
