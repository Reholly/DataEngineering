One of the ways to prepare is to create a safety plan, Jordan said.\n“If a person calls, we help them to identify maybe some safe people in their life, who can provide some support,“ Jordan said. “Can they possibly pack a bag and keep it at their home? Do they have someone who is able to provide transportation when they are ready to get out?”\nSafe Berks operates a 24-hour hotline and crisis service with trained staff members who can connect people to emergency shelter, legal services or help come up with a safety plan. A\n Medical Advocacy Partnership Program sends an advocate to hospitals to help those hurt as a result of domestic violence or sexual assault. A staff member is stationed at the courthouse to help those seeking a Protection from Abuse Order from 7 p.m. until midnight.\nDomestic Violence Services of Cumberland and Perry has similar services, including emergency shelter. Staff members are there to answer the phone, even late in the evening on holidays. Executive Director Sonya Browne said she has not seen an uptick in people seeking help during this season, but services stay the same as the rest of the year.\n“I noticed there were a couple shifts done over the holidays where people just wanted to talk, and so our staff, if they have time, they’re there for that also,” Browne said.\nThe data on whether domestic violence increases during the holidays is inconclusive,\nsome domestic violence advocates have noted.\nNational Domestic Violence hotline, which fields domestic violence calls from different states, does not track individual reports and incidents of domestic violence.\nThe hotline’s latest impact report does show there has been an increase of people reaching out for help annually for the last three years. Here are other places that provide emergency domestic violence support, including during the holidays.",
