Earlier, a doctor required an experience of 20 years to be a part of any of the board. The judgement also made it mandatory for the two boards to arrive at a decision“preferably” within 48 hours of the case being referred to it 370In another judgement, a Supreme Court bench led by CJI DY Chandrachud upheld the central government's move to abrogate Article 370 of the Constitution.

The judgement was made in May this year. A faction of the Shiv Sena under the leadership of Eknath Shinde had rebelled against Uddhav Thackeray in June 2022. To deal with the situation, Thackeray issued 16 disqualification notices through the deputy speaker. However, the rebel MLAs then moved a no-confidence motion against the deputy speaker which was rejected based on lack of authenticity. Later, Thackeray resigned from his CM post even before the execution of the floor test ordered by the governor SC in its judgement observed that even though the governor's order for a floor test was illegal, Thackeray's resignation couldn't be reversed because it was voluntary marriageA five-judge Supreme Court bench on October 17 announced its judgement in the Supriyo @ Supriya Chakraborty v Union of India, upheld the validity of the Special Marriage Act, 1954, and refused to legalise same-sex marriage.
