These aren’t just statistics; they represent lives saved and communities strengthened.”\nIn 2023, Brooklyn recorded 337 shooting incidents, down from 449 in 2022, and 397 shooting victims, down from 544. There were 15 fewer murders, with a notable decrease in gun homicides, which constituted 63 percent of the total number of murders this year. This ratio is similar to the record lows of 2018 and 2019 when homicides involving shootings were at 64 percent.\nSignificant gains were observed in Brooklyn North precincts, particularly in Brownsville’s 73rd Precinct, where murders dropped by 67 percent and shootings by 30 percent.\nOther areas like East New York and Bedford-Stuyvesant also saw substantial declines in shootings. Greenpoint experienced an 87.5 percent decrease in shootings, while southern neighborhoods like Sheepshead Bay and Coney Island recorded drops of 71.5 percent and 55.6 percent, respectively. Overall, gun violence in public housing developments fell by 41 percent.\nThe seven major index crimes in Brooklyn decreased by 5.1 percent in 2023. Burglaries were down by 18.4 percent, grand larcenies by 7.2 percent, reported rapes by 6.1 percent, and robberies by 4.2 percent. However, there were slight increases in felony assaults and grand larceny auto.\nThe DA’s Office’s efforts included the indictment of 32 alleged gang members, including drill rapper “Sheff G,” and initiatives focused on prevention, such as domestic violence programs and gun buyback events.\nBrooklyn’s Conviction Review Unit continued to address past miscarriages of justice, exonerating three individuals in 2023.\nThese statistics, based on the NYPD’s preliminary CompStat reports as of Dec. 24, 2023, reflect a concerted effort by the Brooklyn DA’s Office, the NYPD and community partners.\nLeave a Comment",
