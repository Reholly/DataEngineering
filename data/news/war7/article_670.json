    "text": "Two of the world’s largest defense contractors said they signed a long-term agreement that will accelerate procurement and delivery of geospatial information considered integral to F-35 pilot training.\nMaxar Intelligence and Lockheed Martin announced their growing partnership May 6, saying it will improve the F-35 Full Mission Simulator. The FMS, as it’s known, puts people inside a copycat cockpit with displays and other devices that replicate software, sensors and weapons used on the actual aircraft .\nThe simulator is a major step in training and is useful for mission rehearsal. More than 2,400 people have been schooled using the FMS, according to Lockheed.\nAt its core are lifelike visuals and environments that Maxar makes possible. The new agreement standardizes pricing, licensing and other requirements for its products, including Dynamic and Precision3D, which generate high-resolution images and three-dimensional models of the Earth. The joint announcement did not mention a dollar figure.\nRELATED\nQ&A: Maxar execs discuss US Army simulation, Project Maven C4ISRNET reporters interviewed a pair of Maxar Technologies leaders on the sidelines of the GEOINT Symposium in St. Louis. <span",
