    "text": "{p}Wednesday, May 8th marks the 79th anniversary of the Allied Victory in Europe marking the end of World War II. Just before the war ended, a small group of U.S. soldiers near Magdeburg, Germany discovered a stalled Nazi death train containing 2,500 Holocaust victims. The soldiers became humanitarians, protecting and ultimately liberating the Jews onboard during the waning days of World War II. Columbus filmmaker Mike Edwards brings this story to life through his four-part documentary series, “A Train Near Magdeburg.” Mike stopped by Good Day Columbus to share this story of humanity and service along with Film Columbus Director John Daugherty who helped the project secure an Ohio Motion Picture Tax Credit.
