    "text": "Joe Mantegna and Gary Sinise will return to host PBS’ National Memorial Day Concert, to take place from the west lawn of the Capitol on May 26. The event, marking its 35th anniversary, honors members of the military and their families, with an evening of music and storytelling. Among the segments planned are a tribute to World War II, featuring Bryan Cranston and spotlighting U.S. Army veteran John T. “Jack” Moran, who fought in the Battle of the Bulge. The segment also will mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day. A remembrance of Gold Star families, featuring BD Wong, will spotlight the story of Vietnam veteran and Gold Star father Allen Hoe, who followed generations of his family into service. Two of his sons also served in the U.S. Army. One of his sons, First Lieutenant Nainoa K. Hoe, was killed in combat in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Another segment, featuring Jena Malone, will focus on the challenges of veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan, with the story of U.S. Marine Corps veteran and amputee Kirstie Ennis, who sent on to become an adaptive athlete and has made it a mission to bring awareness to encourage others to reach out for help. Also featured in the concert will be Cynthia Erivo, Gary LeVox, Jamey Johnson, Mary McCormack, Ruthie Ann Miles, Patina Miller and the National Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Jack Everly. The event also will include a Salute to Services with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Service Color Teams.
