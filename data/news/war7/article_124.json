    "text": "Hutchinson fundraiser to honor Haven native killed in Vietnam War May 9 After working with the Kansas legislature to name a portion of K-96 after their Vietnam War hero relative, a Haven family is holding a fundraiser to help pay for the signage. PFC Henry Lee Fisher is one of 17 Reno County soldiers killed in action during the Vietnam War. The lifelong Haven resident who joined the Army and became part of the 16th Infantry - 1st Infantry Division. He was eventually sent to the frontlines of Vietnam and died on June 18, 1967, at the age of 20. This winter, Fisher’s family helped pass House Bill 2481 to dedicate the portion of K-96 from the east to west borders of Haven. The Kansas House and Senate both passed this bill with unanimous support and Gov. Laura Kelly signed it into law April 18. The stretch of highway will be known as the PFC Henry Lee Fisher Memorial Highway, Fisher's nephew Jake Feil said in an email. While the Kansas Department of Transportation is responsible for maintenance of the highway, the Fisher family must fund the signage. They have raised $12,000, which is just half the funding needed to complete the project. With the help of Vieyra Honors Foundation, a fundraising event has been set for May 9 from 7-10 p.m. at the Baker Ballroom, 17 E 2nd St. in Hutchinson. Proceeds will go to help fund signage for the PFC Henry Lee Fisher Memorial Highway. \"This event will not only honor PFC Henry Lee Fisher but all Reno County soldiers who were killed in action during the Vietnam War to ensure that their ultimate sacrifice for our freedoms must never be forgotten,\" Feil said. The event will feature a live performance by Hutchinson’s very own country music singer/songwriter Morgan Wilk, a full taco bar and a silent auction. Tickets are just $35 and can be purchased online at [vieyrahonorsfoundation.org/events](http://vieyrahonorsfoundation.org/events) or by phone at 620-960-8215.",
