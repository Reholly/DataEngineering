    "text": "(ANSA) – PARIS, MAY 02 – UNESCO has awarded the world prize for press freedom to all Palestinian journalists who cover the war in Gaza, where Israel has been fighting against Hamas for over six months. “In these times of darkness and desperation, we wish to share a strong message of solidarity and recognition to the Palestinian journalists who are covering this crisis in such dramatic circumstances,” said Mauricio Weibel, president of the international jury of media professionals. “As humanity, we owe a tremendous debt to their courage and commitment to freedom of expression,” Weibel said. Audrey Azoulay, director-general of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, said the award pays “homage to the courage of journalists facing difficult and dangerous circumstances.” According to the New York -based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), at least 97 members of the press have been killed since the war broke out in October, 92 of whom were Palestinians.
