Southern extremists were moving ever closer to destroying the Union, with one state after another seceding and Lincoln powerless to stop them. Slavery fueled the conflict, but somehow the passions of North and South came to focus on a lonely federal fortress in Charleston Harbor: Fort Sumter. Erik Larson offers a gripping account of the chaotic months between Lincoln’s election and the Confederacy’s shelling of Sumter --- a period marked by tragic errors and miscommunications, inflamed egos and craven ambitions, personal tragedies and betrayals. Lincoln himself wrote that the trials of these five months were “so great that, could I have anticipated them, I would not have believed it possible to survive them.”\nThe Demon of Unrest: A Saga of Hubris, Heartbreak, and Heroism at the Dawn of the Civil War\n- Publication Date: April 30, 2024\n- Genres:\n[History](/reviews/genres/history), [Nonfiction](/reviews/genres/nonfiction)\n- Hardcover: 592 pages\n- Publisher: Crown\n- ISBN-10: 0385348746\n- ISBN-13: 9780385348744",
