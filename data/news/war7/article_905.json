    "text": "May is Military Appreciation Month, and Activision is marking the occasion with new DLC for Call of Duty games that supports the company's veteran-themed charity, the Call of Duty Endowment. Additionally, Activision has announced it received the biggest-ever private donation to the endowment to the tune of $2.5 million. Kenneth C. Griffin, the founder and CEO of the hedge fund Citadel and founder of Griffin Catalyst, has donated $2.5 million to the charity. This amount will help support the placement of more than 4,000 veterans in new jobs, Activision said. The new DLC out now is the Call of Duty Endowment Knight Recon Tracer Pack for Modern Warfare III, Warzone, and Warzone Mobile, along with the Regulator pack for Call of Duty: Mobile. The Knight Recon DLC for Call of Duty is out nowThe Knight Recon DLC comes with operator skins, weapons, a weapon charm, a calling card, and tokens for double XP, among other things. Here's everything you get: “Vanish” Operator Skin“Lancer” Operator Skin“Silent Siege” KATT-AMR Sniper Blueprint with “Orange Ambush” Tracers“Veiled Vigilance” MCW Assault Rifle Blueprint Weapon with “Orange Ambush” Tracers“Don’t Step on Me” Weapon Charm“Covert Crest” Large Decal“Trident Throne” Weapon Sticker“Thunder Struck” Animated Calling Card“Great Helm” Animated Emblem1 Hour Double Player XP Token1 Hour Double Weapon XP TokenAll active U.S. military members and veterans get this DLC for free.

The full rundown is below: Operator - “Splicer”ORV Vehicle Skin - “Digital Distortion”Swordfish Blueprint - “Digital Distortion”Fennec Blueprint - “Digital Distortion”Calling Card - “Rogue Regulators”Avatar - “Energizing E”Charm - “All Charged Up”Sticker - “64-bit Bravery”100% of the net proceeds of these DLC bundles goes to the Call of Duty Endowment. Pricing was not announced, but these bundles normally sell for $10 USD. Activision also announced a partnership with USAA for an in-game event called U Assist Veterans. Running May 8-22, the event has players in Modern Warfare III and Warzone working together to complete objectives that will lead to money being donated to the Endowment. More details on the U Assist Veterans event will be announced soon. Finally, Activision is teaming up with the Texas Rangers baseball team for programming inside the team's home stadium to celebrate and honor military veterans on May 15. The stadium is also slinging $1 hot dogs that night, so that's something to celebrate, too. 2024 marks 15 years since the Endowment was founded by Bobby Kotick in 2009. Since then, the charity has helped place more than 125,000 veterans in jobs after leaving the service across the US and the UK. Activision said the Endowment spends around $600 to place a veteran in a job, which it claims is just a fraction of what the government spends on job placement. In 2024, the Endowment is aiming to place more than 15,500 veterans in jobs. In other Call of Duty news, it might not be much longer until we learn about the next entry in the series. Call of Duty: Black Ops Gulf War is expected to be revealed soon and shown off during a special Xbox showcase on June 9.",
