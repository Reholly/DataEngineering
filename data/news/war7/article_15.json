    "text": "Hamas said that it was sending a delegation to Egypt for further ceasefire talks, in a new sign of progress in attempts by international mediators to hammer out an agreement between Israel and the militant group to end the\nwar in Gaza.\nAfter months of stop-and-start negotiations, the cease-fire efforts appear to have reached a critical stage, with Egyptian and American mediators reporting signs of compromise in recent days. But chances for the deal remain entangled with the key question of whether Israel will accept an end to the war without reaching its stated goal of destroying Hamas.\nThe stakes in the cease-fire negotiations were made clear in a new UN report that said if the Israel-Hamas war stops today, it will still take until 2040 to rebuild all the homes that have been destroyed by nearly seven months of Israeli bombardment and ground offensives in Gaza.\nIt warned that the impact of the damage to the economy will set back development for generations and will only get worse with every month fighting continues.\nThe proposal that US and Egyptian mediators have put to Hamas -– apparently with Israel's acceptance — sets out a three-stage process that would bring an immediate six-week cease-fire and partial release of Israeli hostages, but also negotiations over a \"permanent calm\" that includes some sort of Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, according to an Egyptian official. Hamas is seeking guarantees for a full Israeli withdrawal and complete end to the war.\nHamas officials have sent mixed signals about the proposal in recent days. But on Thursday, its supreme leader, Ismail Haniyeh, said in a statement that he had spoken to Egypt's intelligence chief and \"stressed the positive spirit of the movement in studying the cease-fire proposal.\"\nThe statement said that Hamas negotiators would travel to Cairo \"to complete the ongoing discussions with the aim of working forward for an agreement.\" Haniyeh said he had also spoken to the prime minister of Qatar, another key mediator in the process.\nThe brokers are hopeful that the deal will bring an end to a conflict that has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, caused widespread destruction and plunged the territory into a humanitarian crisis.\nThey also hope a deal will avert an Israeli attack on Rafah, where more than half of Gaza's 2.3 million people have sought shelter after fleeing battle zones elsewhere in the territory.\nIf Israel does agree to end the war in return for a full hostage release, it would be a major turnaround. Since Hamas' October 7 attack stunned Israel, its leaders have vowed not to stop their bombardment and ground offensives until the militant group is destroyed. They also say Israel must keep a military presence in Gaza and security control after the war to ensure Hamas doesn't rebuild.\nPolice move into camp as US anti-war protests continue\nIn other news, Turkey is ratcheting up its condemnation of Israel's war on Gaza, reportedly upgrading trade restrictions it had previously set to a full embargo on imports and exports, reports Bloomberg/\nThe move comes shortly after a tweet from Israel's foreign minister accusing Turkey of breaking trade agreements, referring to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan as a dictator.",
