    "text": "Ukraine signals willingness for Russia peace talks as Moscow's troops advance Major-General Vadym Skibitsky has explained that the ongoing Ukraine-Russia war can only end in meaningful negotiations. A senior Ukrainian intelligence official has spoken out on the inevitability of talks with [Russia](https://www.the-express.com/latest/russia) to end their ongoing conflict, despite [Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky](/latest/volodymyr-zelensky)'s previous refusal to engage in negotiations with the Kremlin. In an interview published by The Economist magazine on Thursday, Major-General Vadym Skibitsky, deputy chief of [Ukraine](https://www.the-express.com/latest/ukraine)'s HUR military intelligence directorate, acknowledged the necessity of eventual dialogue with [Russia](https://www.the-express.com/latest/russia) to conclude the more than two-year-old war. Skibitsky explained that wars typically culminate in treaties and that meaningful negotiations would likely commence in the second half of 2025 at the earliest. \"General Skibitsky says he does not see a way for [Ukraine](https://www.the-express.com/latest/ukraine) to win the war on the battlefield alone. Even if it were able to push Russian forces back to the borders - an increasingly distant prospect - it wouldnâ€™t end the war,\" the magazine wrote. \"Such wars can only end with treaties, he says. Right now, both sides are jockeying for the 'the most favourable position' ahead of potential talks. But meaningful negotiations can begin only in the second half of 2025 at the earliest, he guesses.\" Don't miss... [ Russia and China's 'partnership' exposed as US shares Taiwan invasion fears ](/news/world-news/136372/russia-china-taiwan-invasion-usa) [LATEST] While [Zelensky](/latest/volodymyr-zelensky) has excluded [Russia](https://www.the-express.com/latest/russia) from a \"peace summit\" scheduled for June in Switzerland, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba suggested in an interview with [Foreign Policy magazine](https://foreignpolicy.com/live/ukraine-top-diplomat-dmytro-kuleba/) that communication with [Russia](https://www.the-express.com/latest/russia) could follow the summit. \"After that, communication with [Russia](https://www.the-express.com/latest/russia) may take place and [Russia](https://www.the-express.com/latest/russia) can be part of the talks. Because you are right: In the end, you cannot put the war to an end without both parties\", Kuleba said. However, Russian President [Vladimir Putin](https://www.the-express.com/latest/vladimir-putin) and Kremlin officials have accused [Ukraine](https://www.the-express.com/latest/ukraine) of obstructing efforts to settle.

In response, [Zelensky](/latest/volodymyr-zelensky) characterized the June meeting as a significant opportunity to initiate the restoration of a just peace. \"All our positions, on the battlefield, in diplomacy and in the information sphere, must be equally strong now,\" he said. \"Our strength, our capabilities, our weapons, unity with partners -- all this must work together. And it will work\", he said on Thursday.",
