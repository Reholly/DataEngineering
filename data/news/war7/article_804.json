    "text": "Hamas said it told Egyptian and Qatari negotiators that it has approved a cease-fire proposal to halt the war in Gaza, according to a press statement. Israel did not confirm whether it would accept or reject the deal that Hamas approved. Negotiations, which have been ongoing for months, intensified over the weekend, with facilitation from U.S. CIA Director William Burns, alongside mediators from Egypt and Qatar. Hamas said it told Egyptian and Qatari negotiators that it has approved a cease-fire proposal to halt the war in Gaza, according to a press statement.\nIsrael did not confirm whether it would accept or reject the deal that Hamas approved.\n“We are exploring every single thing that we hear and we are exhausting the potential about negotiations and bringing back the hostages and that is our main mission to bring them home as quickly as possible,” Israel Defense Forces Officer Daniel Hagari said at a press briefing following Hamas’ announcement. “But in parallel, we are continuing to act in an operational manner, in the Gaza Strip and we will continue to do so.”\nNegotiations intensified over the weekend, with facilitation from U.S. CIA Director William Burns, alongside mediators from Egypt and Qatar.\nThe negotiations came amid Israel’s ongoing threats to invade Gaza’s southernmost city of Rafah, which appeared imminent if a temporary cease-fire agreement was not reached.\nU.S. officials have repeatedly warned Israel against an offensive in Rafah, where millions of civilians have taken refuge.\nPresident Joe Biden reiterated that stance on a Monday call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nLast week, the U.S. paused a shipment of weapons to Israel, including 2,000-pound bombs, as Israel continued to signal that a ground invasion of Rafah could be coming soon, two senior administration officials confirmed to NBC News.\nOn Monday, Israel ordered civilians in eastern Rafah to evacuate, adding to fears that Israel plans to invade the southern city.\nAli Jadallah | Anadolu | Getty Images Hundreds of Palestinians, including children, migrate from eastern neighborhoods after Israel warns them with pamphlets to evacuate Rafah, Gaza on May 06, 2024. NBC News previously reported that the deal would require Hamas to release 33 hostages in exchange for Israel agreeing to release Palestinian prisoners and pause military operations, which would ease the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza.\nThis is developing news.
