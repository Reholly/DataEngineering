    "text": "A 98-year-old Ukrainian woman said she walked 10 kilometres under shelling in just her slippers, supporting herself with sticks and sleeping on the ground. She left Ocheretyne, in Russian-occupied Donetsk, in an effort to reach areas controlled by Kyiv. In a video posted by Ukraine's police on social media on Monday, the woman — identified as Lidia Stepanivna — said she had walked without food or water, and fell several times. \"I survived World War Two, and I am surviving this war,\" Stepanivna said, as she sat on a bed in a shelter. “That war was different. I saw it as well. None of the houses were burnt down. Houses are burning now.” Ukraine's interior ministry said in a statement that the woman was discovered by Ukraine's military in the evening and handed to the police, who took her to a shelter for evacuees.
