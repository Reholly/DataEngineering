    "text": "Photo: Getty Images\nKarol G sent shockwaves throughout the Met Gala with her transformation into fairy royalty.\nOn Monday night, May 6, the Colombian bombshell arrived on the red carpet covered in crystals, platinum blonde hair and prosthetic ears that completed her fairy look. During her stop at Vogue's livestream, she told hosts Ashley Graham and Gwendolyn Christie the inspiration behind her eye-popping look designed by Marc Jacobs.\n\"I think this was the perfect opportunity for me to express how much I love fairies, dreamy vibes and fantasies,\" Karol G explained. \"This was the look that I wanted to go with.\"\nHer debut at the Met Gala comes after a year of success with her recent album Mañana Será Bonito . Her fourth studio album features hits like \"TQG\" featuring Shakira , \"Gatúbela\" featuring Maldy and her smash hit \"Provenza.\" The album comes with 17 tracks in total including collaborations with Romeo Santos , Sech , Sean Paul , Jay Quiles and plenty more.\nThe album earned her a Grammy for Best Música Urbana Album and also earned her two awards from the 2024 iHeartRadio Music Awards including Latin Pop / Urban Album of the Year and Latin Pop / Urban Artist of the Year.\nSee more footage of her her stunning Met Gala dress below.",
