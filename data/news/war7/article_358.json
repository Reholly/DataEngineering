Egypt’s state media, Al-Qahira News , quoted an anonymous high-ranking source along with the news of the arrival of the Hamas delegation, saying, “Significant progress has been made in (ceasefire) talks between Hamas and Israel.”\n“Egyptian mediators have reached an agreed formula on most issues,” he said.\nIn a statement the previous day, Hamas announced that it intended to send a delegation to Cairo and said, “We are going to Cairo with a good stance and to come to an agreement. ” Previously, Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh also told Egypt’s Director of National Intelligence (GNI) Abbas Kamel that he was considering a new ceasefire agreement with a ‘positive stance’.\nIn addition, with the news that William Burns, the Director of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), arrived in Cairo the day before, there is speculation that the cease-fire talks .\nIn this regard, Reuters said that US government officials believe that some progress has been made in negotiations for a temporary ceasefire in the Gaza war and the release of hostages.
