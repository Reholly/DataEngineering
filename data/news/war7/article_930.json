    "text": "100-year-old WWII veteran inducted into Bangor High School’s Veterans Honor Roll BANGOR, Maine (WABI) - The Veterans Honor Roll at Bangor High School grew by one esteemed member over the weekend. We were there as Bangor’s JROTC honored 100-year-old World War II veteran Don Gallupe at their Military Ball. Decades after graduating from Bangor High School, Gallupe returned to the halls of his alma mater. On Saturday, the Bangor JROTC put on their 88th Ram Battalion Military Ball. On Saturday, the Bangor JROTC put on their 88th Ram Battalion Military Ball. Amid the photo ops, dinner, and awards, there was another piece of business to attend to. A BHS Class of 1942 graduate, Gallupe became the ninth member of the Veterans Honor Roll. Cadet Captain Jake Biberstein says they first learned of Gallupe’s connection to the program in February when [TV5 aired a story on his 100th birthday celebration](https://www.wabi.tv/2024/02/07/bangor-wwii-veteran-celebrates-100th-birthday/). “We were watching it in class, and it really gave us this good push to put him in our honor roll, especially on a beautiful night like tonight,” said Biberstein. “It’s great to be able to induct Mr. Gallupe into the Honor Roll because all the hard work, now we get to see it pay off.” Gallupe served in the Army Air Corps during WWII as a gunner on the P-61 “Black Widow” night fighter plane. He was injured and spent eight months in the hospital. Gallupe is the recipient of a Purple Heart. He credits his time in the ROTC for preparing him to take on a leadership role immediately after enlistment. “Then they had a whole troop train that went down to Biloxi (Mississippi). I had all the papers for every guy who was on that train. Then I started to realize that the ROTC background meant something,” Gallupe said. After his induction, Gallupe ad-libbed a 10-minute acceptance speech laced with memories from his time at BHS. He finished by memorializing his seven siblings. All five Gallupe brothers served overseas, including Arthur, who was killed in action in WWII at the age of 24. “I always keep him in mind. Thank you very much for everything,” he concluded his speech, to a standing ovation. Copyright 2024 WABI. All rights reserved.",
