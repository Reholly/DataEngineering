    "text": "Crowds cheered and fired in the air in the streets of the southern Gaza city of Rafah Monday after Hamas said it approved a ceasefire proposal from mediators Egypt and Qatar, an AFP correspondent said.\nPeople were crying tears of happiness, chanting \"Allahu Akbar\" (\"God is greatest\") and shooting in the air in celebration of the news, the correspondent said.\nIsrael's Rafah evacuation order heightens global alarm\nMeanwhile, Israel has called on Palestinians to leave eastern Rafah ahead of a ground invasion of the southern Gaza city, amid increasing global alarm about the consequences of such a move.\nThe evacuation call followed a disagreement between Israel and Hamas over the Palestinian militant group's demands to end the seven-month war, during weekend negotiations in Cairo.\nEgyptian state-linked media said the talks stalled after a rocket attack claimed by Hamas's armed wing killed four Israeli soldiers on Sunday.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to send ground troops into Rafah regardless of any truce, defying international concerns.\nThe foreign ministry in Cairo warned in a statement of \"grave humanitarian risks\" for more than one million Gazans sheltering there and urged Israel to \"exercise the utmost restraint\".\nPresident Joe Biden and Netanyahu spoke and Biden restated \"his clear position\", the White House said.\nIt also said the Israeli premier \"agreed to ensure the Kerem Shalom crossing is open for humanitarian assistance for those in need\".\nIsrael closed the border crossing Sunday after four soldiers were killed there by rockets fired from the Rafah area, an attack claimed by Hamas.\nUN human rights chief Volker Turk in a statement called Israel's evacuation order on Monday \"inhumane\".\n\"It runs contrary to the basic principles of international humanitarian and human rights laws,\" he said.\nMore to follow.",
