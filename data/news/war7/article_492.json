    "text": "RAIPUR: As many as 35 Maoists, including three individuals with bounties on their heads, have surrendered in Dantewada district of Chhattisgarh under the \\\"Lon Varattu\\\" (Return Home) campaign. This campaign, rooted in the local tribal dialect Gondi, aims to reintegrate misguided individuals into mainstream society.Dantewada SP Gaurav Rai confirmed that the surrendered Maoists have renounced violence and expressed their belief in democracy and the Constitution. These individuals were previously active in the Bhairamgarh, Malanger, and Katekalyan Area Committees, often involved in disruptive activities like road digging, tree cutting, and dissemination of Maoist propaganda during bandhs.Under the leadership of IG Sundarraj P of Bastar Range, DIG Dantewada Range Kamlochan Kashyap, DIG (Ops) CRPF Dantewada Range Vikas Katheria (IPS), SP Dantewada Gaurav Rai, Additional SP Smritika Rajnala, and Additional SP Dantewada Ramkumar Barman (RPS), the district police force and CRPF have been actively implementing the Maoist Eradication Campaign and the Rehabilitation Policy of the Chhattisgarh government.Efforts to publicize the administration's Maoist rehabilitation policy have reached the grassroots level, resulting in a noticeable shift within the Maoist cadre. Frustrated with the inhumane ideology of Naxalism and the exploitation of local tribals, more individuals are choosing to surrender and join the mainstream.Of the 35 surrendered Maoists, 25 were facilitated by DRG Dantewada, 06 by RFT CRPF, and 04 by the 111th Battalion CRPF Dantewada.Both the district police force and CRPF urge other misguided Maoists to abandon violence and embrace peace by contacting the nearest police station or camp. They emphasize the importance of contributing to the region's development and prosperity.As part of the Chhattisgarh government's rehabilitation plan, the surrendered Maoists will receive a reward of Rs 25,000 each from the Dantewada Police Superintendent.This recent surrender brings the total number of individuals embracing the Lon Varattu campaign to 796 Maoists, including 180 with bounties on their heads, marking a significant step towards peace and stability in the region.",
