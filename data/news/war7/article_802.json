    "text": "Hamas has accepted a cease-fire deal proposed by Egypt and Qatar TEL AVIV, Israel — Hamas has accepted a proposal from Egypt and Qatar for a cease-fire in its seven-month war with Israel, the Palestinian group said in a statement Monday. The announcement came hours after [Israel ordered](https://www.npr.org/2024/05/06/1249298738/israel-palestinians-evacuate-rafah) tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians to evacuate parts of southern Gaza, signaling a ground assault might be imminent. It is not immediately clear what the proposal entails, nor what Israel's position is. An Israeli official [told local TV](https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel-at-war/artc-hamas-announces-it-has-agreed-to-proposed-ceasefire-and-hostage-deal-with-israel) that the Israeli government was \"checking which formula Hamas has agreed to.\" In a statement late Monday, Hamas said its top leader, Ismail Haniyeh, had informed Qatar's prime minister and Egypt's intelligence minister \"of the Hamas movement's approval of their proposal regarding the cease-fire agreement.\" The announcement on Monday — on the eve of the Gaza war's seven-month mark — raised hopes for some that the fighting may come to a pause. This is a developing story, which will be updated. Copyright 2024 NPR",
