The mission aims to gather soil and rock samples from the far side of the Moon, providing crucial insights into its early evolution and the inner solar system. - This will be the first-ever attempt to retrieve lunar samples from the far side of the Moon, a region hidden from Earth’s view. - Due to the lack of direct communication with Earth, a relay satellite orbiting the Moon will facilitate communication during the mission’s 53-day duration. - Pakistan is set to launch its maiden lunar mission, ICUBE-Q, aboard China’s Chang’e-6 probe. Developed in collaboration with China’s Shanghai University and Pakistan’s Institute of Space Technology (IST), ICUBE-Q carries optical cameras to capture images of the lunar surface.
