    "text": "Hey allll, guess who's back with another Lex/Scar story? ;) And this one's based off of \"Brighter Than the Sun\" by Colbie Caillat. Guys, I don't know what it is about these songs, but they keep giving me ideas (and it's totally not a bad thing)! S here's the story, I don't own the song, nor do I own AVP or any of their characters. Enjoy!! ** All rights reserved by me. I do not allow this work to be used or adapted in any way without my permission.** AN: I do not own the Alien vs Predator franchise or any of it's characters. Karen is an OC made up by me. X.x For the first time in forever, Lex Woods awoke without all the lights on. Her first thought, ironically, being wow, my electric bill isn't gonna be completely outrageous this time. Aside from her silly self jibe, it really did feel like an accomplishment. Stretching luxuriously in her bed, the rays from the sun being the only light source through the curtains, she felt better than she had in a long time. A lot of things contributed to this, like the fact that a year and three months later, she was finally allowing herself to move on. She wasn't ignorant to think that she could ever move on completely - she already knew this would be a scar she would bear forever (both literally and figuratively). But she could accept it for what it was, and she could forgive herself. It didn't hurt that she also had her partner in crime back. That was a positive. A smile crossed her lips as she lazed in her bed, folding her arms under her pillow behind her head. She had managed to befriend an extraterrestrial from another planet... If someone had told her ten years ago that that would await her in the future, she would've laughed in their face and told them they needed counseling. Right now it didn't sound nearly as silly as it had a few days after the incident had happened; it was a bit more believable in her mind now that she'd spent over a year thinking about it (and now a few months living it, breathing it, etc.). And now, this creature, this alien - this guy was now her best friend in the whole world (and beyond, she liked to tease herself by thinking). This thing they had been through together had indeed been horrible, but it had brought them together. As much as Lex hated the fact, she knew that it was because of this reason that she couldn't wish Bouvetoya hadn't happened. She wished with all her heart that there hadn't been casualties (on either side of the spectrum, as Scar had lost brothers as well), but if they hadn't gone in the first place, then there wouldn't have ever been the possibility of the two of them meeting. It was a small world, but what would the chances of meeting have been if it hadn't happened on the island? And if by some chance they had met, what would the circumstances have been? And also, what would the actual meeting have been like? Probably would've made my skull into one of his trophies he adores so much. She shuddered at the thought - her friend definitely had some interesting hobbies. In the past three months, Scar had figured out that she was not at all impressed by his human skull trophies, and absolutely did not want to hear about them. Begrudgingly, but understanding why, he didn't prod her about his escapades on Earth - unless of course he was describing scenery or something else that he'd seen. That is, describing being using all of clicking, hand motions, growling and broken english. It was kind of like charades, except he was able to speak some english, so it wasn't a complete guessing game. And the more he saw her, the more he learned. She knew he could understand everything she said - it was just getting him to actually talk to her in her own language that was a trial. Not that she minded - he didn't need to do that to make her happy. Really, he didn't need to do anything to make her happy other than exist. It sounded really cheesy, but she felt more connected with him, an alien, than she did with anyone on her home planet. She suspected that he felt the same; otherwise, he wouldn't be visiting her as frequently as he did. And she certainly wasn't complaining. In fact, she actually was attempting to figure a lot out for the near future, such as how the hell she was going to cope with her feelings for him. Lex sighed, crossing one leg over the other under her sheets. It was certainly a dilemma in her mind. She didn't even know if he could feel such a thing, himself. It worried her more than she would ever let on. Idly, her finger stroked the warrior mark on her cheek, the fingers of her left hand tracing the familiar edges. This would eat her alive if she didn't get it out, and no one in her life knew about Scar but herself. Her therapist didn't even know that she had interacted with, ahem, aliens during her nightmare journey. Maybe she would start by asking if his species had such a thing as partnership, of the romantic aspect. Yeah, that sounded innocent enough. He probably wouldn't question her motives, and if he did, she would just pass it off as curiosity. The fact that she actually cared what he thought about her said something. She didn't care what anybody thought of her; she never had. Lex knew how crazy it sounded to have a romantic interest in an alien - she was a rational minded woman, of course. But no one knew her quite like he did. No one understood her, but he came pretty damn close. No one made her feel like he did. Through all the time they'd spent together in the past few months, on his various visits to her planet, it had become even more clear. She sounded corny as hell, even to herself. She'd had boyfriends before, but never had she felt this strongly; like the God damn love bug bit her right in the heart. She could go on all day... Laying there, in her bed, feeling content for the first time in a long time, another thought came to her, and it made her snort: Who knew it would take a seven-foot-something humanoid with dreadlocks and mandibles to make her swoon.
