    "text": "With Memorial Day drawing near, it’s important to pause and pay tribute to the courageous individuals who have made profound sacrifices for our nation. Among the many ways to express our gratitude and reverence is by adorning their resting places with beautiful flowers. This touching story shares a time when sending flowers not only helped honor a veteran’s memory from afar, but also impacted the lives of those who thoughtfully delivered the flowers.\nLast year, Carmen Stallings was on active duty at a location far away from where her late veteran father,\nEladio Jusino was laid to rest. She had learned about our partner, BloomBridge, and connected with the company to send flowers to her late father’s resting place.\nBloomBridge runners ensure the seamless delivery of flowers to their designated gravesites. Veronica Arquette, a veteran herself, serves as a dedicated runner for BloomBridge. When Veronica learned that this set of flowers was going to a veteran’s resting place, she excitedly reached out to her father, Marty Arquette, a Vietnam veteran, to see if he wanted to accompany her to place the flowers and pay his respects.\nHer father is still dealing with the side effects of Agent Orange which he acquired during his time in the U.S. Navy. He served from 1959–1968, during which time he saw the world and was also part of the Vietnam War Campaign. Veronica said, “It must be in our family’s DNA because my nephew served in the Navy, my cousin was in the Air Force, my uncle was in the Marines, and I myself am a U.S. Army veteran, serving 11 years active duty.”\nHe held the flowers as she drove and she could tell his emotions were high, as were hers. Veronica said, “The biggest part of it was making sure everything was okay and looked good, so that the family of this loved one can look at the pictures taken and feel at ease that everything is in its place.”\nOnce they arrived, she placed the flowers on the grave. Veronica’s father watched from the vehicle because his legs couldn’t carry him to the specific grave. She put a new American flag in the ground and brushed off debris from the headstone. She knelt down and prayed and said thank you and assured him that neither his family nor his fellow veterans have forgotten him.\nThis happened to be Veronica’s first flower delivery. She was honored to do it and felt it was meant to be. “This gives you an option to keep a connection you may not be able to anymore. Life has changed so much, and many families do not live where they started out. They may have loved ones still buried in their hometowns and cannot make it back as often as they wish. Having this option now gives families that connection again, to show their love but to also feel at ease knowing the stranger on the other end taking the arrangements cares just as much and will make sure everything is done correctly.”\nVeronica hopes that one day, when her father is buried at the Grand Rapids Veterans Cemetery and she can’t make it there as often as she’d like, someone else will be able to do what she can’t do at that moment: bring love and peace to her father.",
