    "text": "What to do and where to go in the Sabine hills north of Rome. An area rich in history and culture.Where is Sabina and what is it best known for? For many people who live in Rome it is an area they have heard of but never visited. It starts about 30 km north-east of the city and runs on up the eastern bank of the Tiber for about another 50 km, while extending eastwards from the riverbank into the Apennines of central Italy. Sabine mountainsThe Sabine mountains, rising to 1,282 metres at Monte Tancia, divide the undulating olive groves of lower Sabina from the higher level Rieti plain and the lakes and river valleys of upper Sabina. [website](https://www.lecascatedellemarmore.com/)to find out when the spectacular openings of the [waterfall](https://www.wantedinrome.com/news/water-sports-near-rome.html)take place.St Francis came from Assisi, but he visited and lived for many years near the mediaeval village of Greccio, high above the Rieti plain. Shortly after his death, his followers built a monastery on the cliffs where he slept and where, in 1223, he organised the first ever living nativity play, re-enacting the birth of Jesus at Bethlehem (now twinned with Greccio). [Every year during the Christmas period](https://www.wantedinrome.com/news/italy-assisi-lights-up-basilica-with-giotto-frescoes-for-christmas.html), the play is re-enacted on various evenings by monks and villagers using real cattle and a donkey. The monastery itself has a collection of model nativity scenes, ranging from an igloo to a tent in the Sahara. FarfaLower Sabina boasts an important abbey at Farfa, which is well worth a visit. It dates back to the fifth century and was one of the most important abbeys in Europe in its day. Damaged by fire during the Saracen invasions of the mid-ninth century, it was soon rebuilt.Because of the threat of Saracen invasions, Pope John III issued a papal bull in 966, ordering the fortification of all the property occupied by the nobility in Sabina. This period of castellamento saw walls, gateways, defensive towers and castles built all over Sabina. RoccanticaRoccantica clings to the flank of the Sabine mountains, a dozen kilometres north of the town of Poggio Mirteto. Dominated by its castle, which became a monastery in the 13th century, the village looks out over olive groves and away to the Tiber, with the rugged outline of [Monte Soratte](https://www.wantedinrome.com/news/apocalypse-in-the-soratte-bunker.html)on the horizon. CarnivalsDuring the year, Poggio Mirteto has two carnivals in April, one of which is called the \"Liberata\", contentiously celebrating the fall of the Papal States in 1861. In May, Selci offers an evening of “Wine under the Stars\", while Configni – located just off the SP313 road from Passo Corese to Terni near the northern Lazio border – holds a wild mushroom and asparagus festival.
