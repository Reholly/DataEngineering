    "text": "The President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky called on his comrades in a speech during the Resurrection of Christ to unite their prayers and pray for each other and for the soldiers at the front. In his words, God, who has a “Ukrainian flag on his shoulder”, will give life overcoming death, said Reuters, quoted by BTA.\n“Let’s pray for each other. When we all came closer to each other, we stopped being strangers to each other,” said Zelensky, dressed in a traditional Ukrainian vishyanka shirt and traditional khaki pants, in an emotional address on social media “Telegram”.\nStanding in front of the 1,000-year-old Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv, a spiritual and architectural monument of Orthodoxy in Ukraine, Zelensky noted that his country has been fighting for victory against Russia for 802 day.\n“And we believe: God has a chevron on his shoulder with the flag of Ukraine. So with such a friend, life can only defeat death.”\nIn Moscow, President Vladimir Putin attended the holiday service, which was led by the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, who strongly supports the Russian leader and his war in Ukraine.\nTens of thousands of people have been killed and millions displaced from their homes since Putin ordered an invasion of Russia ’s smaller neighbor in February 2022. The war has entered its third year, but no its end is yet to be seen, Reuters notes.\nZelensky, who is Jewish, called for prayers above all for the soldiers who will welcome Easter in the trenches to come back alive and well, as well as the land and the people, at his the spirit is “unbreakable” and who, he said, will. they will one day see a free Ukraine.\n“Only Ukrainians kneel in prayer,” Zelensky said. “There were never before residents and invaders.”\nAdd the rating:\n☆\n☆\n☆\n☆\n☆\n2.1\nAssessment 2.1 from 33 voice\n2024-05-05 08:53:00\n#Volodymyr #Zelensky #called #Ukrainians #Join #prayers #invincible\nRelated posts: Fighters from group \"O\" captured a brand new Bulgarian tank in Ukraine PHOTOS Lied and scolded the spores Covid-19: A first glimmer of hope on the coronavirus front - Switzerland Finally ice hockey, finally ERC - Eishockey.net Share this: Facebook X",
