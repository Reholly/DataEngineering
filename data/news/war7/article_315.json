    "text": "Share Share Video Link copied! Arozarena went 1-for-2 with three walks, a solo home run and a second run scored in Friday's 10-8 win over the Mets.\nThe 29-year-old outfielder has had a brutal start to 2024 that includes what would be a career-high 29.1 percent strikeout rate and a career-low .455 OPS, but Arozarena came through with a solid performance in a wild win. His fourth-inning long ball off Dedniel Nunez was his fourth homer in 32 games to go along with four steals, and Arozarena has contributed a respectable 14 runs and 15 RBI despite his woeful .145/.242/.265 slash line.\nMore News Rays' Randy Arozarena: Not starting Sunday 5D ago • by RotoWire Staff Rays' Randy Arozarena: Ends homer drought 9D ago • by RotoWire Staff Rays' Randy Arozarena: Rare day off Thursday 16D ago • by RotoWire Staff Rays' Randy Arozarena: Stays aggressive on basepaths 16D ago • by RotoWire Staff Rays' Randy Arozarena: Swipes third bag 19D ago • by RotoWire Staff Rays' Randy Arozarena: Takes seat Sunday 26D ago • by RotoWire Staff Our Latest Fantasy Baseball Stories Week 7 sleeper hitters Scott White • 1 min read Week 7 sleeper pitchers Scott White • 1 min read Week 7 two-start SP rankings Scott White • 1 min read What to Watch This Weekend Chris Towers • 11 min read Prospects Report: Skenes is ready Scott White • 10 min read Wednesday's waiver wire targets Chris Towers • 4 min read",
