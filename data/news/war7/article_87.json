    "text": "Charles Kahariri: Kenya's Chief of Defence Forces Who Played Key Role in Operation Linda Nchi - General Francis Kahariri had an illustrious military career, having been enlisted in 1987 and commissioned in 1988 - Kahariri went for advanced training in the United Kingdom shortly after being commissioned as a second lieutenant - He served as the vice chief Defence Forces during the late General Francis Ogolla's tenure as the Chief of Defence Forces Michael Ollinga is a journalist at TUKO.co.ke with over 10 years of experience covering courts and crimes, special reports, and current affairs in [Kenya](https://kiswahili.tuko.co.ke/tags/siasa-za-kenya/). President [William Ruto](https://www.tuko.co.ke/tags/dp-william-ruto-news/) has appointed a new chief of Defence Forces barely two weeks after the death of General Francis Ogolla in a helicopter crash. William Ruto appoints Charles Kahariri Chief of Defence Forces Ogolla died along with nine other [Kenya Defence Forces](https://www.tuko.co.ke/tags/kdf-news/) (KDF) officers when their helicopter crashed at the border of West Pokot and Elgeyo Marakwet counties. Immediately after his death, former military boss, retired General Daudi Tonje, said Ogolla's deputy, Lieutenant General Charles Muriu Kahariri, automatically assumed the CDF's powers in an acting capacity. Ruto, Commander-in-Chief of all the armed forces, [appointed Kahariri](https://www.tuko.co.ke/kenya/546906-william-ruto-appoints-general-charles-muriu-kahariri-chief-defence-forces/) as the new substantive CDF to ensure seamless military operations. Who is a three-star general? Since Kahariri was a Lieutenant General, also known as a three-star general, Ruto promoted him to General (a four-star general) first and then appointed him CDF. Kenya can only have one four-star general at a time. This is the highest military rank a KDF officer can attain. Since his appointment, many Kenyans have been interested in knowing about his military career journey. When did General Charles Kahariri join KDF? TUKO.co.ke established that Kahariri enlisted in Kenya Defence Forces on April 3, 1987. On April 15, 1988, Kahariri was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant officer, underwent additional training in the United Kingdom, and served in various capacities on board ships in the Kenya Navy Fleet. According to the [Ministry of Defence](https://mod.go.ke/lieutenant-general-charles-kahariri-vice-chief-of-defence-forces/), the general has trailed an illustrious career over the three decades he has served in the military, holding several command and management positions. Charles Kahariri career in Kenya Navy Kahariri served as the commanding officer of Kenya Navy Ships, Mamba, Madaraka, and Umoja before becoming the commanding officer of the Kenya Navy's Manda base. He went ahead to serve as the Squadron Commander of the Kenya Navy fleet and the deputy commander of the Kenya Navy, a service unit of the KDF. The new CDF was elevated to serve as senior directing staff of the Kenya Navy at the National Defence College and then proceeded to be a deputy commandant of the military. General Charles Kahariri's role in Somalia Kahariri served as the Maritime Component Commander for Operation Linda Nchi, (Operation Protect the Country), during which Kenya's military entered Somalia in 2011. According to the KDF, Kahariri was the Task Force Commander for “Operation Sledge Hammer” during Kenya's military capture of Kismayu. Kahariri represented Kenya as the National Focal Person for the Contact Group on Piracy Off the Coast of Somalia and the Djibouti Code of Conduct. He also served on the National Task Forces for the Delimitation of Kenya’s Exclusive Economic Zones and Delimitation of Kenya’s Extended Continental Shelf. Charles Kahariri's military credentials Kahariri has numerous local and international training credentials under his belt. To build his capacity and enhance his military and leadership skills, Kahariri studied the International Midshipman Course in the UK, the Long Navigation Course in India, a Management and Strategic Planning Course, the Naval Command Course in the USA, the Senior Strategic Leadership Leadership Course in the UK, and the Joint Campaign Planning, Flag Level Combined Maritime Component Command Course in Italy. Kahariri also studied an Executive Development Course at the University of North Carolina, USA, and holds a Diploma in Strategic and [Security](https://www.tuko.co.ke/tags/kenya-security/) Studies from the United States Naval War College.
