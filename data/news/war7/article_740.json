    "text": "In recognition of the significant military operations in the Tumbuktu Triangle of the Sambisa Forest that led to the removal of Boko Haram insurgents, Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State expressed his gratitude for the efforts. During a meeting with Brigadier General Marcel Ejike, the newly deployed Commander of the Sector 2, Joint Task Force Operation Hadin Kai, in Damaturu, Governor Buni assured continued government support for all security agencies in the state. Hailing the military for their achievements in securing the Tumbuktu Triangle and bringing peace to the North-East sub-region, Governor Buni commended their bravery and dedication to safety. He stated, “I want to acknowledge the commendable steps taken, particularly entering the Tumbuktu Triangle of the Sambisa Forest, to ensure our safety and security in Yobe. We will strive to maintain this safety with the support of the military.” Brigadier General Marcel Ejike, on his part, expressed gratitude for the support received from Governor Buni towards ensuring the safety of the state’s 17 local government areas for economic prosperity. During his visit, Ejike emphasized the commitment to securing Yobe State and ensuring that residents can lead peaceful lives without fear. As a token of appreciation for the continuous support of the citizenry to the military, the commander presented a plaque of honor to Governor Buni.",
