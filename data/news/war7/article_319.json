    "text": "BEAUMONT, Texas â€” Growing up, Sam Preston Davis enjoyed hunting, basketball, and tennis but in the army, it was his love of motor vehicles that got him a spot on a B-29 Superfortress. \"It was amazing, and you couldn't believe a plane could be as big as a B-29,\" said Davis. World War II veteran, Corporal Sam Davis, reflected on the the first time he stepped foot into the hulking plane on a new assignment. \"I was assigned to keep it in the air,\" said Davis. Him and the 62nd squadron flew missions out of the northwest field of Guam in 1944 against Imperial Japan. \"We used what they called 'incendiary bombs', we set Japan on fire,\" said Davis. However, Davis said his most memorable moment during the war was not actually in the air or on the ground for that matter, but in the sea. \"Going overseas from Hawaii we ran into a typhoon. We went for several days and couldn't eat anything but dry onion sandwiches,\" said Davis. While in Guam, Davis worked as a heavy equipment operator in the Army Air Corps. His experience in the asphalt plant at the Texaco refinery in Port Neches before the war allowed him to assist in building the base. Davis then went back to Texaco after being discharged in 1946, and by 1949 he asked his current wife of 74 years, Pauline Davis, for her hand in marriage. On their first date, no less. \"It sort of surprised me! I said, 'well, no!'\", Pauline Davis said with a laugh. However, she eventually relented and was unable to further resist his good looks and personality. Pauline and Sam married in 1950 and the rest, as they say, was history. They raised three children together and Sam retired at 59, after 42 years of service with Texaco. As he and his family prepare for Saturdays celebration, Davis reflects on a century of a life well lived. His secrets are chicken, vegetables, and a happy wife. \"When you get married, decide what you're going to do with your money,\" said Davis. In honor of his remarkable life, the city of Beaumont is naming Monday, May 6, \"Sam Davis Day\".",
