    "text": "Members of the audience lay flowers on the plaque commemorating the ghetto fighters and the six million Jews murdered by the Nazis Photo by the Congress for Jewish Culture\nBy Forverts Staff May 5, 2024\nAs people gather on May 5 and 6 to commemorate the six million Jews murdered by the Nazis, those who can’t attend a Yom Hashoah event in person can now view a moving program that took place two weeks ago, April 19, in New York City.\nThe program, organized and performed by the descendants of Holocaust survivors and sponsored by the Congress for Jewish Culture , was conducted in Riverside Park on the site of a plaque called Der Shteyn (The Stone), placed there by the New York City government as part of a plan to build a future memorial there for the Jews who fought the Nazis during the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising on April 19, 1943.\nAlthough the monument project was never carried through, Holocaust survivors, their families and other Jews have been gathering there every year to share memoirs of the uprising, read poetry and sing moving songs written both during and after the Holocaust. At the end the entire audience rises for the singing of the Partisan Hymn, which was written by Hirsh Glik, a 19-year old in Vilna, under the inspiration of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising.\nYiddish Brief A bissel of all things Yiddish: music, cooking, books and more.\nTerms (Required) I agree to the Forward's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy Email (Required) Related Could this be the most meaningful Holocaust memorial in New York?
