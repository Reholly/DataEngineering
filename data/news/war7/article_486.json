    "text": "News Brief\nPoK Will Naturally Join India, No Need For Military Action: Defence Minister Rajnath Singh\nSwarajya Staff\nMay 05, 2024, 01:51 PM | Updated 01:51 PM IST\nSave & read from anywhere!\nBookmark stories for easy access on any device or the\nSwarajya app.\nIndia's Defence Minister, Rajnath Singh,\nstated in an interview with PTI that India will continue to assert its claim over Pakistan-Occupied-Kashmir (PoK), but believes that the region will eventually choose to merge with India due to the development and peace in Kashmir.\nSingh stated, \"I think India will not have to do anything. The way the ground situation has changed in Jammu and Kashmir, the way the region is witnessing economic progress and the way peace has returned there, I think demands will emerge from people of PoK that they should merge with India\".\nSingh emphasised that India does not intend to use force to capture PoK, as he expects the people there to express a desire to be part of India.\nSingh also highlighted the significant improvement in the ground situation in Jammu and Kashmir, suggesting that a time may come when the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) will no longer be necessary in the region.\nHowever, he clarified that decisions regarding AFSPA are under the jurisdiction of the Union Home Ministry.\nRegarding the ongoing conflict with Pakistan, Singh called for an end to Pakistan's support for cross-border terrorism, emphasising that India will not tolerate any attempts to destabilise the country.\nThe relationship between India and Pakistan has been strained, particularly since India's airstrikes on a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist training camp in Balakot, Pakistan, in response to the Pulwama terror attack in February 2019.\nTensions escalated further when India revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and reorganized the state into two union territories in August 2019.\nIndia has consistently stated its desire for normal relations with Pakistan but has emphasised that Pakistan must take steps to create a terrorism-free and friendly environment for such engagement.\nSave & read from anywhere!\nBookmark stories for easy access on any device or the\nSwarajya app.\nSupport Swarajya's 50 Ground Reports Project & Sponsor A Story\nEvery general election Swarajya does a 50 ground reports project.\nAimed only at serious readers and those who appreciate the nuances of political undercurrents, the project provides a sense of India's electoral landscape.
