    "text": "Kateryna Kadabashy | Bloomberg News (TNS)\nHamas is studying a proposal for a temporary cease-fire with Israel in a “positive spirit,” as international pressure mounts on the two sides to reach a deal and end a conflict that has shaken the Middle East.\nThe Iran-backed group plans to send a delegation to Egypt “as soon as possible” to continue negotiations, according to comments by senior leader, Ismail Haniyeh, posted on Telegram on Thursday.\nHaniyeh was speaking to Abbas Kamal, head of Egypt’s general intelligence directorate. The Hamas leader also discussed the situation with Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, and the two agreed to continue talks with the aim of reaching an agreement.\nHamas is a designated terrorist organization by the U.S. and European Union.\nIsrael said it will only consider joining cease-fire talks if Hamas responds to the latest internationally mediated proposal for a temporary truce and release of hostages taken by the group during its Oct. 7 invasion. The conflict has been raging in Gaza for the almost seven months since, and much of the enclave has been reduced to rubble.\nRelated Articles World News | European court upholds Italy’s right to seize prized Greek bronze from Getty Museum, rejects appeal World News | US and Saudis near defense pact meant to reshape Middle East World News | Death toll climbs to 48 from highway collapse in China World News | 4 Americans face 12 years in prison for bringing live ammo to Turks and Caicos World News | The US is building a pier off Gaza to bring in humanitarian aid. Here’s how it would work About 1,200 people were killed in the Oct. 7 attack, with about 250 more taken hostage. More than 34,000 Palestinians have died in the subsequent Israeli onslaught, according to health authorities in Hamas-run Gaza.\nEarlier this week, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged Hamas to quickly reach a decision on terms for a pause in hostilities, describing the offer as “extraordinarily generous.”\nThe U.S. is seeking the release of some hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, alongside a pause that could pave the way to an end to the war.\nHaniyeh stressed “the positive spirit” in which Hamas is approaching the latest proposal, and aims to reach an agreement “in a way that achieves the demands of our people and stops the aggression against them.”\nHamas has previously called for Israeli forces to withdraw entirely from Gaza. Israel has refused to go that far, and is instead preparing to invade the southern city of Rafah, where more than 1 million Palestinians have taken refuge.\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P. Visit bloomberg.com.
