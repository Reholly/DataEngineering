    "text": "The pro-Palestinian encampment that UC San Diego students established last week to protest the war in Gaza drew upward of 200 counterprotesters on Sunday during a tense but peaceful showdown near Geisel Library, participants and university officials said. At least a dozen campus police took positions around the encampment, where the number of tents has risen to more than 50 since the mini-village was created on Wednesday. Police did not attempt to break things up. The ongoing demonstration drew a sharp rebuke Sunday from Chancellor Pradeep Khosla, who said in a public statement that the encampment is \"illegal\" and has \"tripled in size in violation of the group's commitment not to expand the footprint.\" \"The encampment has limited free movement on campus, created a checkpoint for entry into the camp, and denied access to the fire marshal and health inspectors,\" Khosla said. \"As time passes, the threat and potential for violent clashes increases. The presence of a significant number of non-affiliates in the encampment heightens these concerns.\" The university has said it can get help from other police agencies if it is deemed necessary. Khosla has declined requests from The San Diego Union-Tribune to discuss his interactions with the protesters or to say whether he will forcibly remove them from the encampment. Early Sunday, Los Angeles police cleared an encampment that had been set up at the University of Southern California. And last week, New York City police removed 30 to 40 protesters from inside Columbia University's Hamilton Hall. Sunday's counterdemonstrators included Martha Hoffman of La Jolla, who said the encampment \"is just terrible... (The university) should not allow them to chant, 'intifada' \" She was standing not far from Hala Abdulah, a pro-Palestinian student who is part of the encampment. \"We need our school to understand that we are not leaving,\" she said, adding that, \"We are not going to be relying on UCPD to protect us. No cops, no administration, no one's going to protect us. We will protect ourselves.\"",
