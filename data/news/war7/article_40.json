    "text": "‘Art 370 abrogation biggest tribute to Patel’\n*Hands which held bombs now begging\nExcelsior Correspondent\nJAMMU, May 2: Prime Minister Narendra Modi today dubbed the Congress party a “disciple” of Pakistan, and targeted Rahul Gandhi saying the neighbouring country was eager to make the ‘shehzada’ of the grand old party India’s next Prime Minister as the country’s enemies want a weak Government to be at the helm.\nAddressing mega election rallies in Anand and Jamnagar in Gujarat, he said that Congress wants to change India’s Constitution to provide reservation of Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe and Other Backward Classes (OBC) communities to Muslims.\nModi’s comments linking Congress with Pakistan came a day after Chaudhry Fawad Hussain, a former Minister in Imran Khan’s Cabinet in Pakistan, reportedly shared a video featuring Rahul Gandhi on his social media handle and praised him.\n“Pakistan is crying because Congress is dying here. You all must have learnt that Pakistani leaders are now praying for Congress. Pakistan is eager to make ‘shehzada’ (referring to Rahul Gandhi) the next PM. This is not surprising because we already know that Congress is Pakistan’s ‘murid’ (follower)” he said.\n“The partnership between Pakistan and Congress has now been exposed completely. It shows that the country’s enemies want a weak Government in India, not a strong one…A weak Government which was there at the time of 26/11 Mumbai terror attack. They want a corrupt Government which was there before 2014. But Modi’s strong Government neither bows down nor does it stop,” the PM added.\nFollow the Daily Excelsior channel on WhatsApp\nUnlike in the past when Congress was in power, the “tyres of Pakistan’s terror have got punctured” now, he said. “A country which used to export terror in the past, is now struggling to import ‘atta’ (flour). The hands which used to hold bombs are now holding ‘bheekh ka katora’ (begging bowl),” he said.\nThe then Prime Minster served as the guest of Kashmiri separatists and Congress leaders came forward to save Ajmal Kasab, the lone gunman arrested after the 26/11 terror attack on Mumbai, Modi said.\n“Books were written to save jihadis of the Mumbai terror attack and a Congress leader released (one such) book. In Delhi, when terrorists were killed at Batla House, the ‘madam’ of the Congress could not stop tears. When Afzal Guru was sentenced to hang, people from this ecosystem reached the Supreme Court and the President,” the PM said.\nThese people are now calling for “vote jihad” (religion based voting to stop the BJP), he said.\nOn the occasion, Modi remembered Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and said the abrogation of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir was his biggest tribute to the country’s first Home Minister.\nPeople across the world are now saying that India is a global bright spot. India is seen as ‘vishwa bandhu’ (global friend) who can resolve conflicts between two countries, Modi said.\nOn the issue of quota, he said, “Congress wants to give reservation to Muslims, the party’s favourite vote bank. For that, they want to change the Constitution. I challenge Congress to give in writing that they will not change the Constitution to give reservation to Muslims on religious basis.”",
