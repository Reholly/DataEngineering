    "text": "The leader in exile of Hamas has said the group is positive about the latest proposal for a\nceasefire in Gaza as he dispatched a new delegation to Cairo for more talks.\nFollowing days of mixed signals, Ismail Haniyeh on Thursday spoke to Egypt’s intelligence chief by phone, hailing the “positive spirit of the movement in studying the ceasefire proposal”.\nHamas negotiators will go back to Cairo to “complete the ongoing discussions with the aim of working forward for an agreement”, the terrorist group said.\nIsrael and Hamas appeared to be nearing a breakthrough in protracted negotiations on a deal that could put an end to the six-month war in Gaza and win the release of at least some of 133 Israeli hostages still believed to be held by Hamas.\nA leaked copy of the proposal included a pledge to create\n“sustained calm” in Gaza once the first stage of the deal was implemented. The vaguely worded phrase is the closest Israel has come to signalling its willingness for a truce, while its leadership keeps publicly denying suggestions that it would stop the war in Gaza altogether.\nThe ultimate decision will be made by Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas in Gaza and one of the masterminds of the\nOct 7 massacre in southern Israel, according to reports.\nIsraeli broadcaster Channel 12 on Thursday quoted a “source close to” Sinwar saying that the proposal on the table was “an\nIsraeli proposal in an American disguise and it contains a series of booby-trapped clauses”.\nThey also said exiled Hamas functionaries do not speak for the terrorist group.\nIsraeli media on Thursday morning cited unnamed security officials who said they were not optimistic about the outcome of the talks, despite high hopes from Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state.\nIsrael’s war cabinet met on Thursday evening to discuss the possible deal after a previous meeting was cancelled on Wednesday night.\n‘Rafah or the hostages – choose life’\nProtesters and families of\nsome of the hostages in Hamas captivity rallied in support of the deal, decrying remarks by Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, that Israel would launch an offensive on Gaza’s Rafah no matter what happened in the negotiations.\nFamilies of several hostages and their supporters briefly blocked the main highway in Tel Aviv during the morning rush hour, demanding an immediate deal.\nThey unfurled a banner saying “Rafah or the hostages – choose life”.\nMr Netanyahu reaffirmed his stance on Thursday, telling a memorial ceremony for fallen members of a 1930s-1940s paramilitary organisation that Israel “will do what we must do in order to win and to triumph over our enemies, including in Rafah”.\nMeanwhile UN experts have published estimates of the damage done to the densely populated Gaza Strip.\nA report by two UN agencies said at least 370,000 housing units in Gaza had been damaged, with 79,000 of them completely destroyed.\nIt would take until at least 2040 to rebuild all the destroyed homes without repairing the damaged ones.\nOn Wednesday, the head of the UN’s mine clearing agency said there was more rubble, some of it contaminated with mines, to clear in Gaza than in Ukraine where the front line is 600 miles long compared to 25 miles in the Gaza Strip.\nThe post\nHamas leader in exile positive about a ceasefire as negotiators head for talks in Cairo appeared first on The Telegraph.",
