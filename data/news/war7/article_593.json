    "text": "My father enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in 1969, and his father was a combat medic in the Pacific during World War II. Like most from the greatest generation, my grandfather never spoke of what he saw while in the service, and neither did my father until later. What they did do, though, was work to instill the values of honor, commitment and compassion within their families.\nWhat is your life’s purpose?\nThis was a question my father often posed while we were growing up. Though I didn’t join the military, volunteering with the Big Brothers Big Sisters (BBBS) program for nine years helped me define my life’s purpose. Through that opportunity, I found serving my community, along with military and Veteran families, to be my passion and my purpose.\nWhat does it mean to be connected?\nTrust, partnership and a sense of belonging all lead to feeling connected, and there is a direct correlation between connectedness and well-being. Those who interact more frequently with close contacts—whether in a virtual community or in person—report greater well-being than those who interact less regularly. The\nBlue Star Families Military Family Lifestyle Survey (MFLS) found that three-quarters of active-duty family respondents (76%) reported engaging entirely or mostly virtually when considering their three closest relationships outside of their spouse or children and that most military families are getting their support from people who live far away from them. We also know that one of the greatest struggles Veterans face is regaining their sense of purpose after their military service.\nThat’s where the Blue Star Neighborhood comes in!\nIf you haven’t joined The Neighborhood yet,\nactivate your account today!
