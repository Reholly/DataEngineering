    "text": "For 12 years in a row, the Immortal Regiment campaign has been held annually not only in Russia, but around the world as well. This year it takes place May 1st through May 12th. In 2024, the event will again be held in an online format in Russia. The organizers have experience in holding events online. This format was used during the pandemic. There are several ways to honour veterans. For example, print out photos and stick them on your car or clothes. There is a design tool on the Immortal Regiment [website](https://www.polkrf.ru/shtender), where you can choose a frame for a photo, sign the person’s full name and dates of life. Global flash mobs are also planned on social networks. There you can not only post photos, but also share stories about the lives and feats of your relatives with the hashtag #нашБессмертныйПолк (#ourImmortalRegiment). Photos of heroes of the Great Patriotic War will be broadcast on the [Immortal Regiment](https://www.moypolk.ru/) website. In addition, portraits can be seen on media facades in Russian cities and on federal channels. And from May 1st, members of the Volunteers of Victory movement will launch a chatbot on Telegram to create memorable avatars for social networks. The main point of the regiment's march is to preserve personal, family memory of the generation of the Great Patriotic War. Anyone can join the campaign. To do this, you only need a photograph of the hero who brought the Great Victory closer.",
