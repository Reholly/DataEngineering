Liang Wei Keng and Wang Chang capitalised on that start to put China 2-0 ahead with a laboured 21-18, 17-21, 21-17 win against Fajar Alfian and Muhammad Rian Ardianto in the doubles. For Indonesia, Jonatan Christie overcame Li Shi Feng 21-16, 15-21, 21-17 to prevent a whitewash but it merely delayed China's march towards an 11th Thomas Cup title. [Reuters](/reuters-stories)| Updated: 05-05-2024 21:24 IST | Created: 05-05-2024 21:09 IST China's men's team reclaimed the Thomas Cup title after a six-year gap hours after their women's team won the Uber Cup with Indonesia finishing runners-up in both the competitions on Sunday. It was the first time since 2012 when the same nations contested the men's and women's finals at badminton's world team championships and China prevailed on both occasions. Twelve years after whitewashing South Korea in both events in Wuhan, they were nearly as dominant against Indonesia at the Hi-Tech Zone Sports Centre Gymnasium in Chengdu. In the men's competition, world number two Shi Yu Qi beat Anthony Sinisuka Ginting 21-17, 21-6 in the opening rubber. \"I have a lot of responsibility and pressure as captain, but fortunately I made a good start,\" said Shi. Liang Wei Keng and Wang Chang capitalised on that start to put China 2-0 ahead with a laboured 21-18, 17-21, 21-17 win against Fajar Alfian and Muhammad Rian Ardianto in the doubles. For Indonesia, Jonatan Christie overcame Li Shi Feng 21-16, 15-21, 21-17 to prevent a whitewash but it merely delayed China's march towards an 11th Thomas Cup title. He Ji Ting and Ren Xiang Yu combined in a 21-11, 21-15 win over Muhammad Shohibul Fikri and Bagas Maulana in the second doubles to seal China's 3-1 victory before being mobbed by euphoric team mates. China women's team were even more dominant as they blanked Indonesia 3-0 to win their 16th Uber Cup title earlier in the day. The Chinese women strung together 24 straight wins, and no loss, through the tournament to run away with the title. Olympic champion Chen Yu Fei tamed Gregoria Mariska 21-7, 21-16 to give China a headstart. Chen Qing Chen and Jia Yi Fan beat Siti Fadia and Ribka Sugiarto 21-11, 21-8 to extend their lead before He Bing Jiao downed Ester Nurumi 10-21, 21-15, 21-17 to secure China's title. \"During the last three years we experienced failures, and I'm happy that we could regain the title,\" said He. \"Last time it was a shame that we couldn't win the Uber Cup, so over the last two years we were always ready, and we were playing at home.\" (This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)
