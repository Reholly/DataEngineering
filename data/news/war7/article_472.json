(EUROPA PRESS) –\nThe Secretary General of the United Nations, António Guterres, called this Monday for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, where more than 31,100 people have died due to Israel’s offensive against the Palestinian enclave, during the month of Ramadan.\n“My strongest call today is to honor the spirit of Ramadan in order to silence the guns and remove all obstacles to ensure the delivery of vital aid at the speed and scale required,” he said in statements to the press.\nIn this sense, he explained that in Ramadan the Muslim community “celebrates and spreads the values ​​of peace, reconciliation and solidarity.” “Yet even though Ramadan has begun, the killings, bombings and bloodshed continue in Gaza,” he argued.\nLikewise, Guterres has appealed to the “spirit of compassion” in this sacred month, recalling the “immediate” need to release all hostages held by the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) in the Palestinian enclave.\n“I call on political, religious and community leaders around the world to do everything in their power to make this sacred period a time of empathy, action and peace,” he stressed.\nFinally, the UN Secretary General has reiterated that a possible incursion by the Israeli Army in Rafah “could plunge the people of Gaza into an even deeper circle of hell.” “We must act to avoid more deaths,” he concluded.\nIsrael launched its offensive against Hamas after the October 7 attacks, which left around 1,200 dead and some 240 kidnapped. Gazan authorities have put the death toll in the Palestinian enclave at more than 31,100.\nPost Views: 1.267\n#António #Guterres #calls #ceasefire #Gaza #month #Ramadan\n– 2024-05-05 06:20:51",
