    "text": "US based AgEagle Secures Significant Contract for eBee Vision Drones with French Army. AgEagle Aerial Systems Inc., headquartered in Wichita, Kansas, announced on April 30, 2024, its most substantial single order to date, valued at approximately $3.4 million. This significant sale was made through French reseller Flying Eye to the French Armed Forces. The contract includes the delivery of 40 eBee VISION systems and an additional nine eBees, which feature drones, sensors, datalinks, and control stations specifically adapted for public safety, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions by the French Army. The AgEagle Ebee Vision is an intelligent reconnaissance and surveillance drone with a low acoustic signature (Picture source: Flying Eye) The eBee Vision drones, designed for operation in GNSS-jammed environments, have a 20 km operational radius from the pilot. These drones are constructed as flying wings with a wingspan of 1.2 meters and a weight of only 1.6 kg, made from expanded polypropylene, making them light and less detectable by radar. The eBee Vision's acoustic signature is also minimized due to its electric battery-powered engine. In terms of flight performance, the drone is hand-launched by a soldier and lands on its belly. It has a cruising speed of 48.6 km/h and can reach a maximum speed of 72 km/h, with a maximum endurance of 90 minutes. The drone can operate in wind speeds not exceeding 61 km/h and in temperatures ranging from -10 °C to 49 °C. A single soldier can transport, deploy (in three minutes), and pilot the drone using a handheld controller equipped with a seven-inch HD screen, capable of controlling the drone up to 20 kilometers away, even in GNSS-jammed environments. The data link between the drone and the controller is encrypted using AES-256. The total contract value is $3.4 million (approximately €3.16 million) and also includes sensors, control stations, data links, etc. AgEagle, listed on the NYSE American under the symbol UAVS, has established itself as a leading provider of comprehensive drone solutions, encompassing flight hardware, sensors, and software for commercial and governmental applications. Originally founded in 2010 to develop fixed-wing drones and data analytics solutions for agriculture, AgEagle has since expanded its offerings to various industries including energy, construction, and government. Bill Irby, CEO of AgEagle, expressed that this contract underlines the strategic direction of AgEagle's growth in defense and its focus on intelligence and reconnaissance missions. Mark DiSiena, CFO of AgEagle, noted the financial significance of the contract, stating that it not only enhances the company's revenue but also demonstrates AgEagle's ability to secure and fulfill large contracts, reinforcing its long-term viability in the UAV market. This partnership with the French Army is expected to be mutually beneficial, enhancing AgEagle's reputation as a top-tier UAV technology provider and bolstering the operational capabilities of the French military. The deal is anticipated to significantly impact AgEagle's financial performance for the fiscal year 2024, marking a new chapter in the company's history.",
