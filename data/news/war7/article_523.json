    "text": "International\nQueen of Jordan: Time for US to use ‘political leverage’ to end war in Gaza\nQueen Rania al Abdullah of Jordan on Sunday called on the international community to use its “political leverage” to compel Israel to let more aid into Gaza and bring an end to the ongoing war.\nIn a pre-recorded interview on CBS News’s “Face the Nation,” moderator Margaret Brennan noted that President Biden warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about a month ago that U.S. policy would change if Israel’s tactics didn’t. She asked whether Queen Rania thinks the U.S. is starting to use its leverage.\n“Well, look, there’s definitely been a change in tone and language. And you’re right; the President has been warning and has been trying very hard to persuade Netanyahu, for example, to not enter Rafah. But we’ve seen time and again, Israeli officials, not heeding the warnings or counsel or advice of allies,” she said.\n“So, I think it’s time that the international community, including the U.S., really use this political leverage to compel Israel to end the war and to let aid in,” she continued.\nIn recent weeks, Israel has\nexpedited the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza, although international leaders still say more is needed to stave off famine in the strip.\nQueen Rania’s comments also come amid talks of a cease-fire, as Secretary of State Antony Blinken and other U.S. officials have pressured officials in Hamas to accept the terms of a cease-fire.\n[Antony Blinken](\nhttps://thehill.com/people/antony-blinken/ ) [Benjamin Netanyahu](\nhttps://thehill.com/people/benjamin-netanyahu/ ) [Israel](\nhttps://thehill.com/tag/israel/ ) [Joe Biden](\nhttps://thehill.com/people/joe-biden/ ) [Jordan](\nhttps://thehill.com/tag/jordan/ ) [Margaret Brennan](\nhttps://thehill.com/people/margaret-brennan/ ) [queen rania](\nhttps://thehill.com/tag/queen-rania/ )\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc.
