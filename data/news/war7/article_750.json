    "text": "Hamas accepts Gaza ceasefire plan but Israel deems the proposal 'unacceptable' The move marks a critical step towards reducing ongoing violence in the region. Hamas has announced it has accepted a ceasefire proposal for Gaza brokered by Egypt and Qatar which Israel has deemed \"unacceptable\". An Israeli official said the proposal includes \"far-reaching\" terms. The [Hamas](https://www.the-express.com/latest/hamas) militant group says it has accepted an Egyptian-Qatari cease-fire proposal to halt the seven-month war with Israel. It issued a statement Monday saying its supreme leader, Ismail Haniyeh, had delivered the news in a phone call with Qatar’s prime minister and Egypt’s intelligence minister. The two Middle Eastern nations have been mediating months of talks between Israel and [Hamas](https://www.the-express.com/latest/hamas). There was no immediate comment from Israel.

Israel says Rafah is [Hamas](https://www.the-express.com/latest/hamas)’ last stronghold. News of [Hamas](https://www.the-express.com/latest/hamas)’ announcement sent people in Rafah cheering in the streets. People rushed into the streets in front of Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah in the Gaza Strip, chanting and cheering the news. Details of the proposal were not immediately released. But in recent days, Egyptian and [Hamas](https://www.the-express.com/latest/hamas) officials have said the cease-fire would take place in a series of stages in which [Hamas](https://www.the-express.com/latest/hamas) would release hostages it is holding in exchange for Israeli troop pullbacks from Gaza. It is not clear whether the deal will meet [Hamas](https://www.the-express.com/latest/hamas)’ key demand of bringing about an end to the war and complete Israeli withdrawal.",
