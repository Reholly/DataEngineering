    "text": "I hope more expressions of patriotism and pro-Israel support are seen across college campuses. There is a pushback occurring from people who have had it with the illegal pro-Hamas encampments that have spread like a brushfire among higher education institutions. Remember when we said that the Left will make you care and that no one will be allowed to remain neutral? Well, those who aren‚Äôt necessarily political are doing that now, and they‚Äôre explicitly against the pro-Hamas clown show they‚Äôre seeing daily. It‚Äôs disrupted campus life for the sake of appeasing antisemites who are no better than Nazis‚Äîthey‚Äôre just wearing different outfits. At Louisiana State University, fraternities outright neutralized the pro-Hamas crowd who had no idea how to counter their counter-protest. All they had to do was not mess with our flag üá∫üá∏‚Äî Old Row (@OldRowOfficial) [pic.twitter.com/LabTeVHLIi] [May 3, 2024] HAPPENING NOW: LSU frat boys are establishing dominance over the leftist/Palestine protestors!

It happened at the University of Alabama. It also happened at LSU. What binds these two opposite sides together is the chant \"f**k, Joe Biden.\" You have to be a special sucky president when the patriots and the terrorists hate you. Happening right now at LSU. Both sides are chanting \"F*ck Joe Biden\" in unison.‚Äî End Wokeness (@EndWokeness) [pic.twitter.com/02CijYtPuM] [May 3, 2024]",
