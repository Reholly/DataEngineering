    "text": "\"Türkiye welcomes Palestinian resistance group Hamas' acceptance of the Gaza cease-fire proposal,\" President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said Monday, [APA](https://apa.az) reports citing Daily Sabah. Speaking to reporters following a cabinet meeting in the capital Ankara, Erdoğan said Türkiye welcomes the announcement, with its efforts. He continued by saying that Israel should take the same step and accept the cease-fire and hostage-release proposal. \"I call on all Western actors to put pressure on the Israeli administration [in this regard],\" the president said. \"We spoke on the phone with Ismail Haniyeh, the Political Bureau Chief of Hamas, prior to our Cabinet meeting. During our conversation with Haniyeh, we discussed efforts to end the conflicts and violence in Gaza,\" Erdoğan said on X. He added that they assessed Hamas' acceptance of the cease-fire proposal received through intermediaries. \"In the phone call where I expressed that we find Hamas's decision, influenced by Türkiye's suggestions, positive, we emphasized that Israel also needs to take steps for a permanent cease-fire,\" Erdoğan further said. Erdoğan also called on all parties, particularly Western countries, to exert \"necessary pressure\" on Israel for a cease-fire.",
