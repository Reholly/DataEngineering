    "text": "The Telegraph Michael Morpurgo: We can’t let a fear of upsetting children stop us from talking to them about war Michael Morpurgo May 5, 2024 at 5:00 p.m. · 11 min read Link Copied Read full article 'I grew up in an age of heroes': illustration by Michael Foreman for Finding Alfie: A D-Day Story by Michael Morpurgo - Michael Foreman/Scholastic\nThere was a time when the books I was writing for young people were often ­dismissed as nostalgic or ­irrelevant. Less often now, I hope.\nWar Horse was one such story. Although it was shortlisted for the Whitbread Prize in 1982, it was the opinion of some of the judges, I was told, that children weren’t interested in history, that war was the past. ­Children liked to live, I was advised, in the now. I’d been a teacher for eight years, and a father too, so I knew this wasn’t true. How else can we begin to comprehend today, or conceive of tomorrow, if we know nothing about yesterday?\nI grew up in an age of heroes. I was born in 1943. I spent my early years in post-war London, where our playgrounds were bomb sites. On the way to school, I had to walk past a blind veteran who was often sitting outside the sweet shop, playing a mouth organ. He had a Jack Russell that bared its teeth and growled at me even when I was walking by on the other side of the road. I never liked to go too close to that dog, or that ­veteran. Others did, and would drop coins sometimes into his upturned helmet. He saluted everyone who did.\nI had another reason for not going too near. The blind soldier always dressed smartly, and wore a row of medals on his blue blazer with silver buttons. Everything about him was tidy, and I liked the tunes he played. But all I could think about was that he had only one leg, one shoe. His other trouser leg was folded underneath him somehow. It was his missing leg that horrified me, that haunted me, but fascinated me. I would dare to stare at him sometimes as I passed by, but my mother’s hand would tighten on mine and she would tell me not to stare, that it was rude.\nI learnt that same lesson when a family friend came to visit. Eric Pearce was always smart, his shoes shining, and he had a gold watch chain, which dangled from his ­waistcoat pocket. He had been a pilot in the Fleet Air Arm, I’d been told, had won lots of medals and was very brave. He’d spent the war flying his plane off an ­aircraft carrier out at sea, attacking German submarines.\nBut I wasn’t so interested in that. I was much more fascinated by one side of Eric’s face, by his left ear that was hardly there, by his strange wandering eye that didn’t seem to see, by the reddened skin that looked unnaturally thin and stretched over his cheekbone, and by his hand with fewer fingers. In the war, my mother told me, Eric’s plane had crash-landed and burst into flames. He’d been dragged from the burning ­wreckage badly burnt, nearly dead, and spent years in hospital .\nMy mother impressed upon me every time Eric came to tea, that it was rude to stare. ­However hard I tried, my eyes seemed to be drawn to his face. I met Eric 60 or more years later, when he was nearly 100, in a home, and apologised for staring at him as I had. He smiled, and told me he hadn’t minded one bit. He much preferred it when people stared, he told me, than when they looked the other way.\n'I wanted to prove myself in the same fire in which both my uncles had been tested': Michael Morpurgo - Jay Williams\nMy uncle Pieter was simply a photograph on the mantelpiece at home when I was growing up. He was the uncle I never met. All I knew was that my mother, his ­sister, who adored him, often cried when anyone mentioned his name.\nHe was in the RAF, in Bomber Command , based in Cornwall. He had been on a raid over German-occupied France. But his plane had been hit over their target in Brest, and the pilot was too badly hurt to go on flying the plane. My uncle Pieter was a Sergeant Navigator, and had never flown a plane before. As they came in over the coast of Cornwall, Pieter flying the plane as best he could, he told the rest of the crew to bale out, and then, knowing the pilot was too badly injured to jump, he tried to land the plane himself at his home base at St Eval. The plane crashed on landing and they were both killed. The ­remainder of the crew lived.\nUncle Pieter was 22 when he died. He had been an actor, trained at Rada, extraordinarily handsome from his photograph. He is buried in the churchyard in Radlett, near his parents’ home. His courage has inspired me all my life.\nThe story of Uncle Pieter’s elder brother, Francis Cammaerts, has been just as influential. Uncle ­Francis was a teacher. He was also a socialist and a pacifist. So when war was declared, he took a very different path from Uncle Pieter, who had joined up almost at once. Francis had to go before a tribunal to convince them his pacifism was genuine. He was sent to help on a farm in Lincolnshire, ploughing and sowing, shepherding sheep, raising pigs.\nThen he heard that his beloved brother had been killed. Unwilling now to stay out of it, he joined up. A teacher friend of his, Harry Ree, had joined some mysterious unit he said he could not talk about, and advised Francis to go along to see them. That Francis spoke fluent French would help, he said.\nSo Francis went along to an address in London that Harry gave him, and within a few months found himself being trained up in Scotland, as a secret agent in the Special Operations Executive, and then dropped into France to link up with the Resistance there. In two years he effectively became the leader of 10,000 Maquis resistance fighters across the whole south of France. He was known to be brave as a lion, never rash, a formidable organiser, and much loved by all who fought with him. He soon had a price on his head, sought after by the Gestapo and the Milice – the French police collaborating with the occupiers. After the war, Francis went straight back to teaching. I was fortunate to get to know him well in his old age.\n'How can we begin to conceive of tomorrow, if we know nothing about yesterday?': still from the 2011 film adaptation of War Horse - Alamy\nAfter school, I found myself ­wondering what path in life to take. I think I wanted to prove myself in the same fire in which both my uncles had been tested. I joined up, became a soldier, went to Sandhurst, learnt more about comradeship, less about shooting straight or ­polishing boots perfectly. I left the Army, and went off to university, then into teaching, and through teaching into writing.\nBut it’s hardly surprising – being a child born in war – that war, and the terrible consequences of it, have played such a prominent part in my stories over the years.\nThere is a difficulty in writing about the suffering of war, when I know my readers are often very young. The principle underlying all my books is one I learnt as a teacher. Very early on, when I was finding my voice as a storyteller in the classroom of Wickhambreaux ­Primary School, I would use the last half hour of every day to tell my Year Six class a story – either one of my own or an adaptation of some folk tale. I discovered quickly that if I wanted to keep their attention I had to mean the story, believe it and live it as I told it – and look them in the eye. Above all, I knew that I must not ever patronise them. I told my story, asked no questions ­afterwards, just let them go off home when the end-of-school bell rang, with the tale still in their heads, wondering.\nAs a teacher and a parent I did not want my stories to traumatise them. But to see them saddened, deep in thought, working out the rights and wrongs, the fair and the unfair, was important. Many would have known grief already. Some would have serious difficulties at home. I felt that the stories I was telling should not avoid the painful side of life.\nWar is part of the world into which they have been born. They know this all too well, and all too soon in their young lives, that’s for sure. The children of today come across images of war on their phones: of bombs falling, of whole towns destroyed before their eyes. They see unimaginable scenes of ­suffering in hospitals under siege. They witness families grieving over dead bodies. They hear and see stories, vividly told, of the ­consequences of war, too: the ­starvation, the disease, the drowning of migrants escaping conflict.\nI’m sure the instinct often is to switch off, or to look away, but once seen, such images are difficult to forget, and they can be deeply troubling. They are also ­unexplained to the young mind. But the young mind is endlessly inquisitive. Children want to know, to discover more of the unknown, even if it is disturbing.\n'I write about \"the pity of war\" – that's what I want to pass on to my readers, adult or child': illustration by Michael Foreman for Finding Alfie: A D-Day Story by Michael Morpurgo - Michael Foreman/Scholastic\nI have tried never to shy away from writing stories about those moments in history or in my life that have affected me deeply. A visit to Venice gave me cause to write a story, for instance, about the Holocaust. One night, walking over the Accademia Bridge, we came down into a piazza and witnessed the sublime – a street violinist playing the most exquisite music: Mozart. Then we saw a young boy of four or five, sitting some distance away on his tricycle in his pyjamas totally lost in the music. We stayed, not wanting the moment to end.\nThe next day, we walked down an alleyway into the Jewish ­quarter , from which, we discovered, more than 200 Jews had been deported to concentration camps in 1944. Very few returned. Heaven on earth it had been the night before listening with the boy to the ­violinist playing Mozart. Now here was a reminder of hell on earth.\nI wrote The Mozart Question shortly after, my story of the power of music over evil. Yes, it’s about the horror of the camps, but it’s also about the survivors, how they and their descendants deal with the enormity of the loss, and how music enriches their lives.\nThe generation before us did not look the other way. Eighty years ago, Allied troops set out from the shores of Britain, in the biggest seaborne invasion ever made, to liberate occupied Europe. At dawn on June 6 they began their landings on the beaches of Normandy. Many died on those beaches, but there was no shaking the resolve of our forefathers. They never ­surrendered, they fought on the beaches, and within a year they had defeated perhaps the worst tyranny that ever threatened mankind.\nThose beaches were not far from Dunkirk, where four years before, more than 300,000 soldiers had been picked up off the beaches by the Royal Navy and that famous armada of ­little boats and brought back to safety. A defeated army lived to fight on again another day. And that day was D-Day.\nMy new book, Finding Alfie, is a story of one of those brave ­soldiers who was there at Dunkirk in one of the little boats to help bring the army home, and four years later, was there at the ­Normandy landings.\nWilfred Owen once wrote of “the pity of war”. It is that pity I write about. That’s what I want to pass on to my readers, adult or child, wherever they live. I like to think of my stories as kites of peace flying high: stories of how the past was for those who lived it, but ever hopeful for a brighter future, ever more sure that freedom is worth ­defending, and that we should never take it for granted.",
