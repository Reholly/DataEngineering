    "text": "Hossein Mahditabar, researcher in international relations At midnight on April 13 and in the early morning of April 14, the armed forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran responded to the Zionist regime's attack on the Iranian consulate in Syria by targeting the regime's military bases from the Iranian soil. Two key points need to be considered when analyzing this event: firstly, Iran refrained from using its most advanced weapons and military capabilities. Iran had more modern drones and missiles that decided not to utilize in this operation. Iran opted not to employ cutting-edge technology. The Iranian equipment used against the Zionist regime and its allies was remarkably cost-effective, causing even a so-called Israeli successful defense to be seen as damaging. Despite being inexpensive and not the latest generation, these Iranian weapons hit their targets efficiently, neutralizing the enemy's most advanced weaponry. It's worth noting that Iran did not use one of the fundamental principles in military strategy: the element of surprise. The operation was carried out without this crucial factor, which is noteworthy. Had surprise been a factor, even this level of Zionist regime's defense would have been unlikely to happen. However, beyond these points, it's essential to acknowledge that a military milestone has been achieved on a global scale. In this operation, Iran launched a strike against a regime in possession of nuclear weapon, challenging the significant principle that powers with nuclear weapons are immune to direct attacks from others. This raises a critical issue. Moreover, multiple other nuclear powers attempted to ally with the Zionist regime to thwart Iran's attack but were unsuccessful. Essentially, Iran engaged with several nuclear powers simultaneously and successfully achieved its objective in the operation. This event represents a major milestone in the global military landscape and ensures Iran’s security for years to come. True Promise Operation: Emergence of Iranian nation’s determination For the past century, West Asia has been under the influence of regional powers following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the weakening of Iran. Initially, it was the British, and later the United States, who dictated how regional dynamics should unfold. This began with the Balfour Declaration and later the Sykes-Picot Agreement, reshaping West Asia into a new configuration. The establishment of the Zionist regime worsened the crisis in the region, a trend that persisted for years. However, in recent times, this pattern has been disrupted and transformed. Current developments in the region cannot be comprehended without acknowledging Iran and its allies as significant players. This shift was exemplified first in Operation Al-Aqsa Flood and then in Operation True Promise. The Axis of Resistance network has demonstrated its capacity to bring about a new order in the region and assert its influence. In doing so, it has confronted the Zionist regime for months. Operation True Promise illustrated that the Zionist regime and its allies no longer hold sway over the region's affairs. The reality that the Islamic Republic is now a decisive force in the region has resonated deeply with the people as well. True Promise Operation in support of the Palestinian cause Everything unfolding in the region currently, including Operation True Promise, is intricately tied to the Resistance network. From a scientific perspective, the Axis of Resistance is perceived as a network of power, comprising actors united in the common goal of liberating the region from the rule of the Zionist regime and the dominance of the US. Iran plays a significant role in this network, serving as a central hub and link for independent Resistance groups. Thus, Iran's actions, exemplified in Operation True Promise, align with the goals of the Resistance network. Western governments' efforts to curb Iran's regional influence are essentially aimed at weakening this network's power. Furthermore, the Zionist regime's attack on the Iranian consulate building in Syria was a reactionary response to the Resistance movement's military defeat of the regime. The regime's attempts to achieve its military goals have fallen short after several months. Their own admission acknowledges the active presence of several thousand Palestinian Resistance forces in Gaza, signaling the regime's military setbacks. On one hand, Hezbollah has destabilized the northern borders of the Zionist regime, while on the other hand, Ansar Allah's active presence in the Red Sea has posed challenges for both the regime and its allies in the region. The regime's political instability is also apparent. Consequently, the regime's leaders sought to strike at the heart of the Resistance network by attacking the Iranian consulate building, hoping to counter the successes of this network. They believed that targeting Iran could weaken the Resistance network and bolster the regime's prospects for success. They assumed that while Iran may have the capacity to retaliate, it lacks the necessary resolve, thus significantly weakening the Resistance network. However, with Iran's response, this scheme failed. Essentially, the regime aimed to weaken the relationship between Iran and the Resistance groups and diminish the power of the Resistance network, but their efforts were unsuccessful. Therefore, everything essentially revolves around the concept of the Resistance network. The Zionist regime's attack in Syria and Iran's response to it are part of the confrontation between the Resistance network and the Zionist regime, and it cannot simply be viewed as an issue solely related to Iran. True Promise Operation: Destroyer of the myth of the Zionist regime's power It's important to recognize that the ongoing existence of the Zionist regime relies heavily on several key factors. One such factor was internal stability, which allowed the regime to encourage Jews from around the world to immigrate to occupied territories. However, this stability has long disappeared. In recent years, we've witnessed successive collapses of Zionist governments. Presently, the primary threat to the survival of the Zionist regime, notably the Islamic Republic of Iran's ability to easily menace the occupied territories, implies that the regime can no longer entice immigrants with promises of stability and security as it once did. Another cornerstone of the regime rested on its global reputation and prestige. However, this prestige was significantly diminished during the recent months-long conflict in Gaza. The massacre of over 30,000 civilians was a stain on the regime's reputation. Furthermore, the attack on the Iranian consulate building sparked substantial backlash against the regime on a global scale. Another fundamental support for the regime, upon which it heavily relied, was Israel's military might. Once hailed as one of the world's leading military powers, the regime's leaders believed that even if they faced internal challenges, they could still effectively ensure external security and shield the regime from outside threats. However, all these beliefs crumbled with a limited military operation carried out by Iran. The regime's numerous defense systems proved ineffective in safeguarding its vulnerable points from threats. It's worth noting that the Nevatim Airbase is strategically located and heavily fortified due to its proximity to Israel's nuclear facilities. Consequently, the regime's ability to deter threats was compromised, leading to humiliation. Previously, it was assumed that if anyone attacked Israel, the regime could mount an effective defense and respond decisively. However, this scenario did not unfold. In reality, the military foundation of the Zionist regime was weakened easily, similar to its other sections.",
