    "text": "ANKARA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Monday welcomed Hamas's acceptance of a proposal for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.\n\"We were pleased that Hamas accepted the ceasefire (proposal) following our suggestions. Now, the same step should be taken by Israel,\" Erdogan said at a press conference after a cabinet meeting in the capital Ankara.\n\"I call on all Western actors to put pressure on Israel to that end,\" he said.\nErdogan held a phone conversation with Hamas politburo chief Ismail Haniyeh after the movement accepted the Gaza ceasefire proposal.\nThe president said on social media platform X that the two sides discussed the efforts made to end the conflict and violence in Gaza and evaluated Hamas's approval of the ceasefire proposal it received from the mediators.\nHaniyeh has told the Egyptian and Qatari sides mediating the Gaza truce that his movement approved their proposal regarding a ceasefire in Gaza, the Gaza-ruling Palestinian faction said in a statement on Monday. ■",
