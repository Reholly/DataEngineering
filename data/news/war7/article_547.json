LA CROSSE (WKBT) -- The 30th Freedom Honor Flight trip honors veterans with a journey to Washington D.C. to see memorials built in their honor. Since it's founding in 2008, Freedom Honor Flight has flown over 2,600 veterans to the nations capital. Two World War II veterans, Seven Korean War veterans and 92 Vietnam War veterans were all present on the flight. One participant says she's been wanting her grandpa to attend the flight for years. \"He's been looking forward to this all week. He's a little nervous but just to know that he's going to go to Washington D.C. to see all these monuments and everything it is just so amazing,\" said Maddie Eggerichs. The flight was not only attended by veterans. Two physicians and four paramedics from Mayo Health System and Gundersen Health System also joined the group. COPYRIGHT 2024 BY NEWS 8 NOW/NEWS 8000.
