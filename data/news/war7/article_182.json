    "text": "A bipartisan majority in the U.S. Congress recently took the noble and necessary action of devoting a fresh round of aid worth $61 billion to Ukraine. Now that the U.S. has stepped up militarily, the West needs to ramp up a line of effort that has been lacking in its Ukraine strategy: intensifying economic warfare. It’s a tactic that President Ronald Reagan and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher would have embraced — and one that will undermine the Russian military and the Vladimir Putin’s regime’s stability.\nReagan came into office perceiving the Soviet Union’s economic weakness, and resolved early in his presidency to use American economic power to bring down the USSR. In 1982, National Security Advisor William Clark said in a speech, “We must force our principal adversary, the Soviet Union, to bear the brunt of its economic shortcomings.”\nLater, the seminal National Security Decision Directive-75 of 1983 articulated the need “to seek to minimize the potential for Soviet exercise of reverse leverage on Western countries based on trade, energy supply, and financial relationships.” Hence, throughout the 1980s the vast majority of U.S-Soviet trade was dominated by agricultural products. American machinery and equipment composed 13 percent of U.S-Soviet trade totals in 1981, but fell to 5 percent by 1985.\nToday, the Western war effort is hamstrung by Kremlin leverage over the West in the form of continued oil and gas exports.\n-snip-\nSadly, many Ukraine-supporting democracies have not done enough to wean themselves from Russian energy — a work Donald Trump started as president by sanctioning the now-defunct Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Hungary, Slovakia, Belgium, Czechia and France were the largest buyers of Russian fossil fuels within the European Union in February 2024.",
