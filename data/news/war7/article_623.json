The integrated tracking unit will be used to counter air targets from Russian forces, performing short-range searches, classification, and identification of threatening aircraft and missiles in Kyiv’s airspace.\nAsia-Pacific The South Korean military shot down an unidentified balloon over the Yellow Sea in March 2024. The balloon, measuring approximately two meters in diameter, was detected by the Marine Corps stationed on Baengnyeong Island near the Northern Limit Line (NLL) – the de facto inter-Korean maritime border. Sources familiar with the situation reported that the balloon lacked any visible means of propulsion and drifted erratically across the NLL, prompting a response. A KA-1 light attack aircraft was scrambled from a nearby front line base and successfully engaged the balloon, bringing it down. Recovery efforts at sea were reportedly unsuccessful.\nToday’s Video",
