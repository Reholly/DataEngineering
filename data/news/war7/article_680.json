    "text": "NATO Allies France, Germany, Italy, Lithuania, Poland, Slovenia, Spain, Türkiye, the United Kingdom and the United States conducted a crossing of the Vistula river near Korzeniewo, Poland.) The river-crossing was part of exercise Dragon 2024, a Polish-led multinational exercise, involving 20,000 soldiers from 10 countries, including 15,000 soldiers from the Polish Armed Forces.\nExercise Dragon falls under Steadfast Defender 2024 – NATO’s largest exercise in decades. Steadfast Defender 2024 is testing the Alliance’s new regional defence plans with forces practising rapid deployment and combat in both Norway and Poland. It is enabling Allies to demonstrate their ability to command and control large ground, air and sea forces across significant distances, within the Euro-Atlantic area.\nSteadfast Defender 2024 involves 90,000 forces from all 32 Allies including new NATO Ally Sweden. It is conducted across various NATO countries and demonstrates the Alliance’s readiness to protect and defend every inch of Allied territory.\nFootage includes shots of Polish and Spanish Leopard tanks, US Abrams tanks, Turkish BMC Vuran, German Boxers and British Army Jackals using different types of amphibious assets to cross a river.\n|Date Taken:||03.03.2024|\n|Date Posted:||05.06.2024 08:17|\n|Category:||B-Roll|\n|Video ID:||922100|\n|VIRIN:||240308-O-D0483-1001|\n|Filename:||DOD_110285041|\n|Length:||00:03:55|\n|Location:||PL|\n|Downloads:||0|\n|High-Res.
