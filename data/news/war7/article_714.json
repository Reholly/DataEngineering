    "text": "Denys Shmyhal, Prime Minister of Ukraine (Vitalii Nosach, RBC-Ukraine) Support from Western military will help Ukraine push back the enemy. If the time comes, Kyiv will be grateful for such a move from its partners, according to Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal. As mentioned earlier, responding to the question of whether Ukraine would welcome the deployment of troops from NATO countries, Shmyhal stated that this would help repel the enemy. However, today Kiev is only requesting military equipment from its allies. “If the time comes, we will be absolutely grateful, and we will be glad,” he said. Deploying Western troops to Ukraine At the end of winter, French President Emmanuel Macron raised the possibility of deploying troops to Ukrainian territory. The words of the French leader caused concern among his colleagues, but there were also those who would support such a move. As Macron explained, he does not rule out any scenario, as the world is currently dealing with a person (dictator Vladimir Putin) who knows no bounds in his actions.",
