    "text": "EL PASO, Texas — No. 16\nNotre Dame cruised to a 40-8 win against No. 19 Oregon State in the Sun Bowl on Friday. Here are some initial takeaways from the Irish’s win against the Beavers (8-5) to finish 10-3:\nNotre Dame’s defense showed up\nMaybe Oregon State interim coach Kefense Hynson knew what was coming when he talked through Notre Dame’s defense the day before the Sun Bowl, listing off how the Irish would start nine seniors, even after having another two opt out of the game. Despite the fading relevance of minor bowl games, Hynson knew Oregon State would get a defense ready to treat this like a College Football Playoff game. And considering the Beavers were down two quarterbacks, three offensive linemen, the top running back, top receiver and top tight end, this all felt like mission impossible for Oregon State.\nAdvertisement\nIt was.\nOregon State’s first four drives totaled 56 yards and four first downs. Its fifth ended with a\nBenjamin Morrison interception. And that was the only play the Beavers ran in Irish territory until the fourth quarter with the game already decided.\nThe statistical carnage should carry over to next season for Notre Dame considering how much talent returns, assuming safety\nXavier Watts follows Jack Kiser, Howard Cross and Rylie Mills in coming back for a bonus year. Javontae Jean-Baptiste, JD Bertrand and DJ Brown will depart from the Sun Bowl lineup, but if defensive coordinator Al Golden returns as expected, Notre Dame has the foundation for a Playoff-caliber defense.\nThe nation’s No. 1 pass efficiency defense terrorized Oregon State quarterback\nBen Gulbranson, who was sacked four times, and the Beavers finished with 197 total yards. Notre Dame’s defense allowed just eight touchdown passes all season while intercepting 16. Notre Dame might not face another opponent as decimated as Oregon State, but the defense proved all year that it can face middling competition and reduce it to a series of punts and turnovers — and it even added a safety in the fourth quarter.\nFINAL\nNotre Dame 40\nOregon State 8\nThere’s cereal everywhere\n[pic.twitter.com/fJcbvRPTvf]\n— Pete Sampson (@PeteSampson_)\n[December 29, 2023]\nAngeli got the help he needed\nThis was how it was supposed to look, something\nSam Hartman probably noticed while watching from the sideline on Friday.\nFirst-time starter\nSteve Angeli got plenty of protection from a reworked offensive line, but the big change was the production at wide receiver. Jayden Thomas returned to full health from a September hamstring injury that sidetracked his junior year, putting up four catches for 59 yards. Jordan Faison continued to make “former walk-on” and “lacrosse” footnotes in his Notre Dame career, posting five catches for 115 yards. Both scored a touchdown.\nGO DEEPER\nSteve Angeli plans to savor his moment as Notre Dame's starting quarterback\nIt was all a stark departure from the regular season when Notre Dame failed to produce at wide receiver, perhaps part of the reason why Marcus Freeman moved on from Chansi Stuckey for Mike Brown as coach of the position. Regardless, whatever Brown did in bowl prep worked.\nAdvertisement\nThomas looked like the veteran receiver that Notre Dame lacked all year, able to sit in zones and get open against man coverage. Faison was the big-play threat the Irish have been desperate to find, getting deep twice against Oregon State, once for a 55-yard catch from Angeli. Notre Dame’s wide receivers had produced one 100-yard game in the previous 25 games, making the production especially notable.\nAngeli completed 14 of 18 passes for 212 yards and three touchdowns and added 27 yards rushing.\nWith\nDuke transfer Riley Leonard enrolling next month, it’s not clear what opportunities await Angeli at Notre Dame during spring practice. But the Irish would love to have the sophomore stay to compete for the job. Few players grabbed the opportunity of the bowl season more than the quarterback.\nAngeli finds Faison\nAnother Irish touchdown ☘️\n[#GoIrish]☘️ [pic.twitter.com/etsKpMG5IZ]\n— Notre Dame Football (@NDFootball)\n[December 29, 2023]\nIrish youth movement fast forwards\nIn terms of faith in the next generation of Notre Dame’s offense, Freeman showed plenty to start the game when the Irish took over at the 4-yard line. Notre Dame started five freshmen in left tackle\nCharles Jagusah, receivers Faison and Jaden Greathouse, tight end Cooper Flanagan and running back Jeremiyah Love.\nThen the Irish welt on an 11-play, 96-yard touchdown drive. Notre Dame never looked back.\nMuch of the skill talent on offense will travel with Notre Dame to Texas A&M to start next season, which should give\nincoming offensive coordinator Mike Denbrock confidence. Denbrock made an appearance in El Paso during the week to briefly meet with the team after his hire from LSU was made official.\nLove and sophomore running back\nJadarian Price both impressed in place of Audric Estime, combining for 158 yards from scrimmage and two touchdowns. Price’s 106 rushing yards were a career high. Love scored on a 13-yard dump-off from Angeli in fourth quarter, making multiple defenders miss before reaching the end zone.\nAdvertisement\nMuch was lost to opt-outs and coaching changes — quarterbacks coach Gino Guidugli called plays after offensive coordinator Gerad Parker’s departure for\nTroy — but it barely looked like it.\nIs the bowl bump real? Notre Dame will find out.\nA year ago Notre Dame knocked off\nSouth Carolina in the Gator Bowl, then rode an offseason of good vibes with Hartman’s arrival that carried the Irish straight into that prime-time showdown with Ohio State. Notre Dame was never quite the same after that heartbreaking loss, but it benefitted from the smooth runway that came from a bowl win.\nNow Notre Dame gets to do it all over again.\nWith the defense returning largely intact, the coaching staff upgraded and the young offense getting experience in the Sun Bowl, Notre Dame will be seen as a strong contender to make the first 12-team College Football Playoff. And with a softer schedule — there’s no Ohio State next year — it would almost be a shock if the Irish didn’t make it.\nBowl games might not mean what they once did to the season that just finished. Notre Dame’s 19 opt-outs and NFL Draft declarations suggest as much. But Friday’s blowout of Oregon State could still mean plenty in how Notre Dame will be viewed during the next eight months after winning 10 games and finishing in the top 20.\nAnd there’s value in that.\n(Photo of Jadarian Price and Steve Angeli: Sam Wasson / Getty Images)",
