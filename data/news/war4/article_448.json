    "text": "Campaign spokeswoman: Permanent ceasefire a first step to end the unfortunate situation (French) The Global Campaign for an Immediate, Permanent Ceasefire in Gaza has called for New Year's Eve celebrations to be an opportunity to call for a ceasefire in Gaza, and to carry out a symbolic event to accompany local celebrations around the world. A statement from the campaign said it called for making the New Year's Eve moment \"an opportunity to make decisions for a brighter future\". \"With nearly 30,10 civilians killed, including more than , children, our only decision in the new year is to call for a permanent ceasefire.\" The campaign aims to mobilize people from around the world to join their local New Year's Eve celebrations, on 31 December, to call for an immediate and lasting ceasefire in Gaza. \"Our goal is to turn the traditional countdown to the new year into an effective and resounding countdown to a permanent ceasefire in Gaza,\" the statement said. \"The campaign has been successfully embraced by more than 30 countries united in its mission to stop the brutal killing of civilians and save lives in Gaza, the West Bank and Israel,\" the statement said. \"A permanent ceasefire is the first step to ending the current unfortunate situation, and a concrete move towards a future where trauma-affected communities can rebuild and recover,\" said campaign spokeswoman Bushra Mohammed. According to its founders, the campaign was launched in London in mid-December by a group of young activists who fell apart on social media. Source : Al Jazeera",
