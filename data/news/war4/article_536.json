    "text": " Officials and workers in the metallurgical industry of the DPRK have made big strides in putting the production on a scientific and modern basis.\nThe Kim Chaek Iron and Steel Complex built a line for producing pig iron through an energy-saving oxygen heat blast furnace. And it has increased the productivity while saving a lot of electricity in close cooperation with researchers at Kim Chaek University of Technology and made advances in manufacturing equipment necessary for hot rolling.\nThe complex newly developed and applied a control program for oxygen separator with a capacity of 15 000 cubic meters per hour and oxygen heat blast furnace to further raise the IT level.\nThrough the brisk introduction of advanced technologies, the Hwanghae Iron and Steel Complex further boosted a degree of accuracy of the amount of raw materials for the blast furnace and considerably reduced the time of analysis of slag.\nA system of providing a fixed quantity of raw materials was developed to lower the amount of raw material consumed per unit of product, and a device was made to measure the moisture of the concentrates.\nOfficials and workers at the Chollima Steel Complex built a process for recycling continuous casting crystallizer and established a communication network system between pieces of equipment to consolidate the production base. And they are pushing ahead with the work to establish the precision casting process at the final stage.\nThe Musan Mining Complex improved the performances of parts of rotary drills and prolonged their durability to increase their operation rate. And it solved problems arising in the production of various kinds of tools.\nThe Chongjin Steel Plant has carried out its goals for technical development.\nOfficials, workers and technicians at Unryul and Jangsan mines and the Hungnam Electrode Factory, too, are taking sci-tech measures to revitalize production.
