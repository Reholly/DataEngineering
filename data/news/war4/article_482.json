    "text": "WATERLOO, Iowa (KWWL) -- The National Park Service has announced 11 communities that will be designated as American World War II Heritage Cities, and Waterloo is one of them. The American World War II Heritage Cities program is meant to honor contributions of towns and cities who \"stepped into the workforce\" to support the war efforts. Contributions can include defense manufacturing of ships, aircraft, uniforms, or the production of food and consumer items for members of the armed forces. The following communities have earned the designation: - Foley, Alabama - Tempe, Arizona - Richmond, California - Wilmington, Delaware - Waterloo, Iowa - Baltimore County, Maryland - Johnson County and Warrensburg, Missouri (joint community nomination) - Hastings, Nebraska - Boulder City and Henderson, Nevada (joint community nomination) - Yonkers, New York - Bedford County, Virginia Former Waterloo Mayor Tim Hurley, who helped lead the movement for the designation, said in a statement, \"Waterloo's contributions on the home front, as well as in the field, to the World War II Allied Forces victory is a perfect example for why this national designation was envisioned. I have learned so much about what our Waterloo soldiers, sailors, Marines and citizens did to help win the war. We should be very proud of our WWII history, and that we are the only city in Iowa to earn this honor from the National Park Service.\"",
