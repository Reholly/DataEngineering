    "text": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan – In a significant development, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have agreed on a bilateral legal framework that will pave the way for massive Saudi investment in Pakistan.\nAccording to a government source, a formal agreement is expected to be signed soon. Authorities here regard it as a significant accomplishment. “The major barrier for Saudi investment has been removed,” said the source.\nIn consultation with Saudi authorities, the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) played a crucial role in finalizing a detailed investment framework for Saudi investment in Pakistan. According to the source, the caretaker cabinet has already approved changes to the legal framework for investment per international standards.\nBecause Pakistan has previously lost investment disputes in international arbitration tribunals, it has been hesitant to include provisions relating to international arbitration in new investment agreements. On the other hand, foreign investors generally want provisions about global security in their investments.\nInterference from courts and the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has harmed Pakistan’s foreign investment environment, leading to international arbitration in the past. The World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes fined Pakistan $6 billion for canceling a mining lease for the Reko Diq project to Australia’s Tethyan Copper Company. Foreign investors are hesitant to make significant investments without concrete guarantees and the option of international arbitration. Saudi Arabia’s concerns were similar.\nA ruler from an Arab country even told Pakistani officials how anyone could invest in Pakistan while the NAB and courts harassed the investors.\nSaudi Arabia is expected to invest around $25 billion in Pakistan. It also anticipates significant investment from the UAE, Kuwait, and Qatar, for which the SIFC is working hard to create an investment-friendly environment in Pakistan.\nDuring the PDM government, the Pakistan Army helped to establish the SIFC, a one-window solution.\nThe SIFC was established to help foreign investors by removing impediments and bureaucratic red tape.\nAs with the FATF, the military’s role in the SIFC is coordinating and facilitating various federal and provincial authorities to remove bottlenecks for smooth foreign investment.\nProvided by SyndiGate Media Inc.
