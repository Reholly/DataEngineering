ULFA is the oldest insurgent group operating in Assam. India's Home Minister Amit Shah and Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma were present at the signing of the accord. Shah said this was a big day for people of Assam. “Assam has suffered for long due to the violence of the ULFA and 10,000 people lost their lives in this violence since 1979,” he said. trending now Saying that every clause of the pact will be implemented fully, he added that a big development package will be announced for Assam as it is mentioned in the accord. The home minister further said that violence in Assam has come down by 87 per cent. The death toll has reduced by 90 per cent and cases of kidnappings are down by 84 per cent. Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma called the accord \"historic\".
