    "text": "Mosab Hassan Youself, \"The Son of Hamas,\" gives an unbelievable interview on The Israeli-Palestinian Conflict and exposes the truth about Hamas.\nWatch this whole interview from start to finish because Mosab explains in great detail how this conflict began, why it's happening, and what needs to be done for it to be resolved.\nA few of the questions Mosab answers are:\n- Can you explain what Hamas is, what it's goal is, and what it does for both the Palestinian people as well as Israel?\n- Does Hamas actually use it's citizens as human shields? If yes, can you explain what that practically means? Do they really conduct military operations from schools and hospitals and residential buildings? If yes, why?\n- Does Hamas have a \"pay for slay\" program, in which they pay Hamas terrorists for killing (or taking hostage) innocent Israelis?\n- Can you explain what those who have been brought up in the west fail to understand about the mindset and culture of those in Hamas? Why do so many in the west support it, and do you think they actually know/understand what they're supporting?\n- Is Israel illegally occupying Gaza and The West Bank?\n- Is Israel truly an apartheid state?\n- Is Israel trying to commit a genocide against Palestinians?\n- Does Israel have the right to exist?\n- What is the resolution to all of this? Is a two-state solution possible (or even desirable)?\n- What can us regular people do to improve the world and lead us toward peace?\nYou can get your copy of Son of Hamas here ► ⁠https://amzn.to/47ZslNw",
