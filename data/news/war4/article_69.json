    "text": "2023-12-28 23:20:00 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky discusses “peace formula” with Pope Francis Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently took to his former Twitter account to announce that he had a conversation with Pope Francis about Ukraine’s “peace formula.” During their discussion, Zelensky mentioned that representatives of over 80 countries are already involved in the process and more will be joining soon. In addition to discussing the peace formula, Zelensky expressed his gratitude to the Pope for his Christmas greetings to Ukraine and its citizens. Zelensky also thanked the Pope for his “blessings and wishes for peace for all of us,” and expressed his appreciation for the Vatican’s support of Ukraine’s efforts. The conversation between Zelensky and Pope Francis comes at a crucial time for Ukraine as the country continues to navigate its relationship with neighboring Russia and strives for peace within its borders. The involvement of over 80 countries in Ukraine’s peace formula process signals international support for the country’s efforts, and the additional support from the Vatican further strengthens Ukraine’s position on the global stage. As the situation in Ukraine continues to develop, Zelensky’s discussion with Pope Francis highlights the importance of diplomatic relations and international cooperation in achieving peace and stability in the region. #Zelensky #discussed #Pope #peace #formula #Ukraine",
