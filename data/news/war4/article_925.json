    "text": "2023-12-31 13:00:50 Israeli photographer Ziv Koren has captured the harrowing journey of Miya Shem, who recently returned home after spending 55 days in captivity. Koren accompanied Shem as she shared her story of survival, giving a firsthand account of the trauma she endured. During her time in captivity, Shem was shot with a Kalashnikov bullet in her arm, a grim reminder of the danger she faced. Koren’s photographs capture the physical and emotional toll of her experience, offering a raw and unfiltered look at the aftermath of her ordeal. One particularly striking image shows Shem wearing a shirt that miraculously survived a Black Sabbath concert, a symbol of resilience amidst the chaos. The juxtaposition of this memento with the wounds she sustained serves as a powerful reminder of the human spirit’s ability to endure and overcome. In addition to documenting Shem’s journey, Koren also captured the everyday moments of her return home, including the simple pleasure of enjoying a meal with loved ones. These photographs highlight the significance of normalcy and routine after experiencing such trauma, emphasizing the importance of finding comfort and solace in familiar surroundings. As Shem continues to heal and process her experiences, Koren’s photographs stand as a powerful testament to her strength and resilience. Through his lens, he offers a glimpse into the indomitable human spirit, showcasing the capacity for hope and healing in the face of adversity. #ynet #news #economy #sports #health",
