    "text": "EL-DHEER, Somalia , Dec. 30, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- In a remarkable turn of events, El-Dheer town in Somalia , once held captive by the oppressive rule of Al-Shabaab for 16 long years, is now basking in the glow of newfound freedom and peace. Government forces, in collaboration with local freedom fighters, successfully liberated the town, culminating in a significant victory over the notorious terrorist group.\nKhalif Omar Moalim Nur, leader of local Somali freedom fighters in El-Dheer, the former stronghold of al-Shabaab pirates. (PRNewswire) Journalist Shafi'i Mohyaddin Abokar interviews leader of Somali freedom fighters, Khalif Omar Moalim Nur. Senior NewsBlaze.com journalist Shafi'i Mohyaddin Abokar had the privilege of conducting an exclusive interview with the charismatic leader of the local freedom fighters, Khalif Omar Moalim Nur. Despite the challenges, Khalif Omar Moalim Nur and his forces played a pivotal role in driving Al-Shabaab militants from El-Dheer, bringing an end to years of Al-Shabaab brutality.\nRead the full story here:\nhttps://newsblaze.com/world/africa/normal-life-somali-town-govt-forces-end-16-year-al-shabaab-brutality_194787/ The interview, conducted via phone from the Khalif's base in a remote area outside El-Dheer, offers a unique insight into the operation and the ongoing efforts to eliminate any remaining Al-Shabaab remnants in the region.\nThe Khalif expressed cautious optimism about the future, emphasizing a commitment to continue the fight until the entire central Galgduud region is free from the clutches of terrorism. The leader underscored the importance of witnessing the transformation firsthand, inviting local and international media to observe the resurgence of normalcy in El-Dheer and neighboring areas.\nThe strategic control over coastal regions was highlighted by the Khalif as a significant blow to Al-Shabaab, rendering them landlocked and disrupting their ability to escape or import crucial supplies. The liberation of seaports Igo and Mareeg, once under the control of militants, marks a turning point in the fight against Al-Shabaab.\nResidents, who endured so much hardship, can now experience a gradual return to normalcy. Some medical care has been reinstated, and the reopening of the town's hospital stands as a testament to positive changes. However, challenges persist, and schools need repairs and learning materials. The international community is urged to support the region's recovery, with assistance to rebuild what was destroyed during years of Al-Shabaab rule.\nAs the world witnesses the triumph of resilience over terror in El-Dheer, NewsBlaze remains committed to surfacing the stories of hope and recovery from regions emerging from the shadows of conflict.\nFor media inquiries or further information, please contact:\nAlan Gray\nMaxMention.com\n+1 775 241 8446\nAbout Shafi'i Mohyaddin Abokar\nShafi'i Mohyaddin Abokar Islaw is an accomplished journalist based in the UK with a versatile portfolio that spans a range of subjects, including sports.
