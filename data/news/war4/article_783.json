    "text": "Morocco Claim They're the Ones to Beat in AFCON 2023 After announcing the lineup following their fourth-place finish in the 2022 World Cup, the coach addressed the media to discuss Morocco's role in the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations and their new position.\n\"We've gone from being 'outsiders' to being the favorites after the World Cup, making the African teams playing against us even more motivated to face us and beat us,\" said Walid Regragui about their new role as favorites in Africa.\nRegarding how to handle this situation, he appeared calm, mentioning it's all about mentality and understanding the role they now play. He stated, \"It's a new status for Africa and for the world as well, and it's a role we'd like to hold for many more years,\" responded the Moroccan coach.\nMorocco will now start planning for their debut in AFCON 2023 as the top contender, with players like Hakimi, Ziyech, Bono, among others, aiming to replicate their performance from the previous World Cup and become the kings of Africa.",
