    "text": "2023 has been a great year for the WW1 Game Series, with Christmas Truce and Wolf Truce events returning in Verdun and Tannenberg, and Verdun appearing in a French museum exhibit. The series also celebrated our 10 year anniversary - Verdun entered Early Access in 2013! Isonzo especially has had a good year - starting off by winning the IndieDB Indie of the Year 2022 award, thanks to your generous votes! For our part, we made sure to implement masses of new content. From our first big expansion with the Piave map all the way to a snowy end to the year with the White War release, the game has grown substantially! - 4 Huge New Maps! - 8 New Weapons! - 2 Cosmetic DLC Packs! - Mac Support! - Much more! If you haven't yet felt the crunch of Alpine snow beneath your boots, Isonzo is currently 67% off [on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1556790/Isonzo/) with DLC up to 30% off until January 4th. Meanwhile [on PlayStation](https://store.playstation.com/concept/10002709/) you can get the Collector's Edition 67% off and the Second Wave DLC pack 30% off until January 6th! Four New Battlefields for Isonzo! Piave - Caporetto Offensive Grappa - Caporetto Offensive Piana - Mountain War Offensive Marmolada - White War Offensive Upwards and onwards! We completed a lot of our roadmap milestones in 2023 just as planned, and there are plenty more coming in 2024! There'll be a new map, more weapons, additional cosmetic DLC packs... and a special game mode! We're maintaining radio silence about the new game mode for now, but keep your ears to the ground and you might pick up some teasers. Marmolada Video Dev Blog Go behind the scenes with map designer Kian as he discusses the creation of Marmolada in [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/9Y1Is925m4c?si=5f8x4Bp8Ngc7v0IP) - including almost 1000 reference images! Verdun at the Museum In the aisles of the History Center of the Notre-Dame-de-Lorette Memorial'14-18 you’ll be able to find a special exhibition! The War games. Playing with History exhibit allows visitors to immerse themselves into WW1 history, by having 10 games available to play. We’re very pleased that Verdun is one of those games! The exhibit runs until May 2024, and entry to the museum and exhibition are both free. If you’re in the area, check it out! Christmas Truce The Christmas Truce is live once again in Verdun, and you’re able to participate in multiple activities together with other soldiers who joined the Christmas Truce. Join a friendly match of football, have a snowball fight or just take a nice relaxing stroll and enjoy the winter scenery. The Truce event runs until January 7th! Wolves in Tannenberg! In October, the wolves returned to the forests of Tannenberg, asking the question: would you cease fire with your human foes to battle a new enemy? Some of you will have managed to hold a successful truce to fight off the canine aggressors, and others, not so much. Last but definitely not least... thank you! We're extremely grateful for all the support from our great community this year, and it's been wonderful to see people enjoying themselves with our games. We can't wait to show you what we have planned for 2024! On that note, we'll end with a little WIP image...",
