    "text": "Save & read from anywhere!\nBookmark stories for easy access on any device or the\nSwarajya app.\nIn a monumental stride towards resolving the decades-long insurgency in the northeast, the Centre is on the verge of signing a historic peace deal with the pro-talk faction of the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA).\nThe upcoming peace deal, to be finalised with the presence of Home Minister Amit Shah and Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, is a major breakthrough in the government's efforts to address insurgency in the northeast.\nAs reported by\nNDTV, scheduled for signing today (29 December), the pact involves the pro-talk faction led by Anup Chetia and Aravinda Rajkhowa, indicating a positive willingness for dialogue.\nHowever, the ULFA (Independent) faction, led by Paresh Barua, remains in opposition, underscoring the complexities of the peace process.\nThe ULFA, formed in 1979 with the goal of \"restoring Assam's sovereignty,\" has been a key player in the region's armed insurgency, responsible for numerous attacks.\nThe peace deal not only marks the end of insurgency but also addresses fundamental issues raised by the ULFA, notably the question of sovereignty.\nOne of the pivotal demands addressed in the peace deal is the formal acknowledgment of six communities in Assam, including Moran, Muttock, Tai-Ahom, Koch-Rajbongshi, Sootea, and Tea Tribes, as Scheduled Tribes (ST).\nThis recognition could potentially result in nearly 50 per cent of Assam's population attaining tribal classification, altering the demographic landscape of the state.\nThe comprehensive peace deal is expected to encompass a financial package, new land reservation measures, rights for Assam's indigenous communities, and a review of the citizenship list.\nSave & read from anywhere!\nBookmark stories for easy access on any device or the\nSwarajya app.\nComments ↓\nSupport Swarajya Bring Out An Exclusive Ram Mandir Print Issue\nDear Reader,\nAs we approach a monumental event – the opening of the Ram Mandir – Swarajya prepares to mark this historic occasion with our finest print edition yet, filled with ground reports, historical analyses, and insightful columns from top thinkers of the country.\nThis isn't just another monthly issue – it's a special edition celebrating a crucial moment in our history.
