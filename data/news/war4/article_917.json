I thrive in a team atmosphere... so many tennis heads giving information. It helps you to think clearly.\"\nPegula's 10th-ranked teammate Fritz kept the tie alive despite a thigh strain he blamed on over-training, defeating Cameron Norrie 7-6 (5), 6-4.\n\"I strained something but got through it,\" said Fritz. \"Cam and I have played so many times (14). It's always a battle, always close.\"\nWorld number one Novak Djokovic opens his season for Serbia later against China's Zhang Zhizhen, with the Chinese team on a high after beating the Czech Republic 3-0.\nIn Sydney, Leylah Fernandez led Canada to a fighting victory over Chile with the former US Open finalist winning her singles rubber and then backing up in a decisive mixed doubles.\nStory continues The 35th-ranked Fernandez got Canada off to a perfect start, cruising past Chile's Daniela Seguel 6-2, 6-3 in 73 minutes.\nWith Canadian number one Felix Auger-Aliassime sitting out the men's singles, 314th-ranked Steven Diez stepped up but was toppled by world number 19 Nicolas Jarry 7-5, 6-4.\nIt set up a deciding mixed doubles, with Fernandez teaming with Diez to battle past Seguel and Tomas Barrios Vera 7-5, 4-6, 10-8.\n\"I'm extremely happy with the way I played,\" said Fernandez, who was part of the Canadian team that won the Billie Jean King Cup for the first time this year.\nThe 21-year-old broke five times in her singles clash against a player in her first WTA Tour-level singles match in nearly two years, using the serve-and-volley tactic well.\n\"First match of the season so had some nerves, but happy with the way I was able to handle it,\" she said.\nmp/str/pbt\nTRENDING 1.
