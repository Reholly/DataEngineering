    "text": "Monrovia – In the wake of the National Election Commission’s official certification, the Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) has extended a congratulatory message to Amb. Joseph N. Boakai and Senator Jeremiah K. Koung on their election as President-elect and Vice President-elect of Liberia, respectively. The CDC committed to supporting Liberia’s peace and development under Boakai’s. However, the party also asserted its dedication to remaining objectively critical of the government’s performance for the greater good. The CDC vowed to advocate for and safeguard the collective interests of the Liberian people, offering constructive criticism to rectify shortcomings and acknowledging the government’s positive actions. In a statement released on Thursday, the CDC emphasized its role as a watchdog for the people, promising to be a vigilant opposition that actively participates in the democratic process. The outgoing party also admonished the incoming government to take genuine steps toward national unity, considering the concerns of nearly half of the country that expressed disapproval of the Unity Party’s vision as shown by the election results. Moreover, the CDC reassured the people of Liberia and development partners that, in its role as the major opposition party, it will not adopt an obstructionist stance. Instead, it would be a nonviolent political force, firmly adhering to its tradition of speaking truth to power. The party also acknowledged the outgoing President and Standard-bearer, George M. Weah, and expressed gratitude for his contributions to strengthening the foundations of peace, democracy, and development in Liberia.",
