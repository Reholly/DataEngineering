    "text": "punjabkesari.in Friday, December 29, 2023 – 10:10 pm (IST) Sports Desk: Afghanistan’s opener Rahmanullah Gurbaz, playing against UAE on the ground of Sharjah, scored a century in just 50 balls and made his team cross 200. Gurbaz, who scored his first century in the T20 format, started taking notice of the UAE bowlers from the very beginning. He hit shots around the wicket and scored 100 runs with the help of 7 fours and 7 sixes. With this, 22-year-old Gurbaz has completed 68 sixes in 44 T20 matches. This innings of Gurbaz was also special because he had not been able to perform anything special in the last four domestic Twenty20 matches. Gurbaz was playing for Strikers in the Abu Dhabi T10. He scored 0 against Braves and also 0 against Samp Army. In the next match, he was successful in scoring 56 runs but in the last match, he was out again after scoring only 1 run. Now he must be feeling some relief after scoring a century against UAE. First T20 century! A brilliant innings from Gurbaz [#UAEvAFG] [pic.twitter.com/RKkVCbaG5Q] – FanCode (@FanCode) [29 December 2023] Talking about the match, Gurbaz and Hazratullah Jazai had come at the opening. When Zazai was out after scoring 13 runs in 16 balls, Gurbaz along with captain Ibrahim Zadran took the score forward. While Gurbaz was successful in scoring 100 runs in 52 balls, Ibrahim Zadran scored 59 runs in 43 balls with the help of 4 fours and two sixes. Azmatullah scored 19 runs on 8 balls. Nabi also contributed 4 runs on 1 ball and scored 203 runs. In reply, UAE had a very bad start. Opener Khalid Shah was out after scoring 0 runs and Mohammad Wasim was out after scoring 4 runs. When the score was 23 in the fifth over, UAE also lost the wicket of Samal. Afghanistan’s bowlers were excellent during this period. He troubled the UAE batsmen a lot.",
