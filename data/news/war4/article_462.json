    "text": "Waterloo community members gathered to send off 33 Iowa National Guard soldiers early Friday, the latest contingent set to serve in a peacekeeping mission in Kosovo that now has lasted 20 years. The soldiers from Waterloo-based Detachment 1, Company C (Medevac) of the 2-211th General Support Aviation Battalion departed from the Waterloo Airport Army Aviation Facility. They will begin on a nine-month stay in the small southeastern European nation after completing pre-mobilization training in Fort Cavasos, Texas, the National Guard said in a news release.\n“We're just really proud of our service members and very proud of our sister state partnership program , and what we can do to not only assist and benefit the country of Kosovo, but also our service members in that training and mission process,” said Jackie Schmillen, public affairs director for the Iowa National Guard.\nMore: Growing Kosovo: Iowa helps build a nation from the ashes of war\nThe peacekeeping mission under NATO auspices began after a brutal war with Serbia in 1998 and 1999 that led to Kosovo's independence. The Iowa National Guard deployments there began in 2003, and in 2011, Iowa and the Kosovo Security Force joined the State Partnership Program. Developed during the Cold War, the program established diplomatic ties between National Guard units and foreign militaries.\nMore: Iowa National Guard plans weekend training center in West Des Moines\nThe soldiers’ primary mission after deployment will be to conduct live aerial medical evacuation operations, refueling and maintenance support for U.S., coalition and Kosovo security forces.\nKosovo Security Force soldiers have visited Camp Dodge in Johnston, headquarters of the Iowa National Guard, and Kosovo maintains a consulate in Des Moines. Kosovo President Vjosa Osmani visited Camp Dodge during a trip to Iowa in October.",
