    "text": "MCPHERSON, Kansas (Video from KAKE, FAMILY PHOTOS, MARY PETERSON, CNN, Family Photos/Mary Peterson) — A 96-year-old Kansas woman who comes from a military family annually sends thousands of holiday cards to members of the military who can’t be home for the holidays.\n\"I think only had 7,000 the first year. But then I had 8,000 last year and 8,000 again this year,” Mary Peterson of McPherson, Kansas, told KAKE .\nAdvertisement Mary has been sending the cards to troops since 2020. In that time, more than 23,000 cards have been delivered to U.S. Army Fort Riley in North Central Kansas and then sent around the world to those who serve in the military.\nKeeping the arts of handwriting and letter-writing alive, the cards — which bear messages written in beautiful cursive writing — say things like, \"God bless you and keep you safe. That is my prayer for you. Grandma Mary, McPherson, Kansas.\"\nShe hopes military members hold the cards near and dear.\n\"I hope that makes them realize that there's somebody that still loves them and loves what they're doing,” she said.\nAnd, Mary hopes the cards hold special meaning for troops who don’t regularly receive letters.\n\"There's so many heartaches and broken homes and people went to the service because it was something else for them to do. And they won't hear from family because they've lost their connection,” she explained to KAKE.\nGrandfather reads bedtime stories to thousands of kids on YouTube While she’s been sending the cards since 2020, Mary is no stranger to sending letters to soldiers.\nThat’s because, when Mary was in high school, her older brother served overseas, and she was sure to send him a weekly letter.\nHer husband also served in World War II and she said she knows what it’s like to have a loved one overseas during the holidays.\nMary told KAKE that her age won’t stop her from keeping up her tradition of sending handwritten cards and that she will continue to send them to troops for as long as her hands will let her write.\nShe said she can write about 50 cards per day. She starts filling them out in the summertime, according to KAKE’s reporting.\nMary isn’t alone in her mission of getting cards in the hands of U.S. military members. Annually, members of the local community, which is located around 62 miles outside of Wichita, donate blank cards.\nSee more in the video player above.\nMilitary veteran gets service dog back on Christmas\nTop Picks Shrek's Swamp, Barbie DreamHouse, 'Ted Lasso' pub: Unique Airbnb listings from 2023 ‘Really?’: Moose caught on camera looks shocked, annoyed when he 'pies' himself in the face with snow Man reunites with firefighter who rescued him from burning home 45 years ago A North Carolina 3-year-old opens entire family's Christmas presents in the middle of the night",
