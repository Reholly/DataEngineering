    "text": "- Support Réseau International We need you by Mikhail Gamandiy-Egorov The creation in 2023 of the AES between Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger represents a major success both for the Sahel region, but also a big step forward on the African continental scale and within the framework of the multipolar world order. Despite the existing challenges, the said alliance represents hope for a very large number of Africans and supporters of multipolarity. The year that is ending is characterized by numerous events and upheavals on a global scale. More than ever, the confrontation between supporters of the contemporary international multipolar order and those who stubbornly refuse to recognize this reality has reached its highest level of intensity. Nevertheless, and despite the numerous challenges that the defenders of multipolarity will have to face in the face of attempts at destabilization that come from an obvious minority of those nostalgic for a bygone era – the determination of the former is more than ever at the top. Including on the great African continent. One of the great events of this year was undoubtedly [creation](http://www.observateurcontinental.fr/?module=articles&action=view&id=5446) of the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) by the leaderships of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger. All with broad popular support from African nations. The new great Sahelian alliance represents not only a hard blow for all the revisionist forces united within an obvious global minority, but above all and this is the most important – a great source of enthusiasm for the citizens of the countries concerned, as well as 'on an even broader African and international scale. As spearhead of Pan-Africanism and multipolarity on the African continent. The challenges obviously remain numerous. The objectives of Western regimes aimed at destabilizing by all means at their disposal the AES projects, the still existing presence of US troops on Niger soil, the security challenges, such as the need to put an end to the countries of the alliance to the neocolonial monetary instrument of the CFA franc. But once again the contemporary reality is such that the so-called attempts at destabilization which emanate from the West today represent in a way a boost to the projects of full and complete liberation both for the Sahel region, as well as on the scale of the whole of Africa which aspires to become an important actor within the contemporary and post-Western world order. Each new advance, including military victories against elements in the pay of the Atlanticist establishment, as was the case with [the Liberation](http://www.observateurcontinental.fr/?module=articles&action=view&id=5407) recent development of the strategic Malian town of Kidal after long years of occupation by terrorist and armed groups – will not only be celebrated, but above all will represent a further step towards achieving the necessary objectives. The AES is ultimately the result of a dream long held by millions of Africans who aspire to true independence and sovereignty, within a pan-African framework and a more just world order. This dream has become reality, but today it is important not to limit ourselves to the achievements obtained and to continue the path traced by the great African names who inspire their descendants more than ever, becoming themselves great sources of additional inspiration. to the new generation of inhabitants of Africa and the world. Once again - this path will certainly be strewn with pitfalls, but knowing the enemies of the contemporary order so well - the partisan forces of the multipolar era have everything necessary to put the said enemies out of harm's way. Step by step, step by step. By striking where it hurts most and freeing themselves from the illusions of the past. The future is multipolar and post-Western. This future is already being built right now. And Africa has a lot to contribute to this common future of peoples who have largely understood how the new global architecture will be built. source: [Observatory Continental](https://www.observateurcontinental.fr/?module=articles&action=view&id=5565)",
