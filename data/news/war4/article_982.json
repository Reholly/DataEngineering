    "text": "In a massive boost for Pakistan, express pacer Haris Rauf has joined the camp ahead of the AUS vs PAK 3rd Test. To note Haris Rauf was taking part in the ongoing Big Bash League (BBL) as his national side suffered another Test series defeat down under. However, the right-arm pacer is likely to take part in the AUS vs PAK 3rd Test starting on January 3 (Wednesday). Earlier, Haris Rauf suffered a lot of criticism from the former cricketers for not being a part of the ongoing AUS vs PAK Test series. Veteran Shahid Afridi also spoke about it stating that Rauf would have enjoyed the challenge of bowling on Australian-prepared fields in Perth and Melbourne. “I think Haris [Rauf] should be part of this side instead rather than [the BBL]. In these conditions, the kind of pace he has, he would have performed well and enjoyed himself on the kinds of pitches Australia prepared in Perth and here,” Afridi, speaking to media at the MCG, said.

The 30-year-old played his debut match in December 2022 against England. During that match in Rawalpindi, the right-arm pacer bowled just 13 overs and gave away 78 runs before his maiden Test wicket. It remains to be seen if the express pacer can make any difference in the third and final Test match to be played at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG).",
