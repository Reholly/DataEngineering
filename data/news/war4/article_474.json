    "text": "Author Jim Herrick, a retired 25-year veteran of the U.S. Border Patrol and esteemed editor Jim DeBellis, brings forth a gripping narrative in “ War on the Rio Grande: Laredo Under Fire .” This novel delves into the intense world of border security, offering a riveting exploration of the personal toll endured by those who safeguard our borders. In this captivating work, Herrick draws on his extensive real-world experience, crafting a story that transcends the traditional boundaries of the genre. Readers will be transported into the life of veteran Border Patrol Agent Kelly Smith, a character navigating not only the complexities of border security but also the profound emotions of love, loss, and sacrifice. The narrative unfolds against the backdrop of a glorious and militarized plan to breach the U.S./Mexican border—a threat unlike any seen before. As Kelly Smith confronts this challenge alongside his partner and best friend, Ruben Garcia, and the new love of his life, Cristina Chavez, the trio becomes embroiled in a web of power, corruption, and a ruthless foe. Herrick’s storytelling beautifully weaves action, suspense, romance, and humour, offering readers a unique perspective from a real-life Border Agent who has witnessed the harsh realities of the frontlines. Herrick, known for his deep insights into border and security operations, brilliantly captures the potential flashpoints of a disturbing reality should the situation at the U.S./Mexico border remain unchecked. The novel not only entertains but also serves as a thought-provoking exploration of the challenges faced by those who dedicate their lives to protecting our borders. “War on the Rio Grande: Laredo Under Fire” goes beyond the action-packed narrative, addressing themes of love and loss on the frontlines, shedding light on the personal toll borne by individuals committed to border security. The novel is a testament to Herrick’s creative imagination, offering an insider’s peek into events that feel all too real. Readers are invited to immerse themselves in this compelling narrative, experiencing the highs and lows of a life dedicated to securing our borders. “ War on the Rio Grande: Laredo Under Fire ” is now available for purchase at major retailers and online platforms. About the Author Jim Herrick is a retired 25-year veteran of the U.S. Border Patrol. He recently completed a tour in Afghanistan as a contractor for the Department of State/CBP as a mentor to Afghan Border and Customs Police advising on border security operations. He has a “Secret” security clearance and has been actively involved in a broad spectrum of border and security operations including anti-terrorism, tracking and surveillance, weapons and canine handling, and the investigation and apprehension of aliens and contraband that enter the U.S. illegally. Jim’s acquired knowledge and experience give him keen insights into the possible scenarios that can occur when you put powerful, callous, and violent drug cartels together with corrupt foreign military powers and governments, a permissive, and ineffectual Mexican buffer, and a weak U.S. border. His creative imagination gives us an insider’s peek into major events that are just waiting to happen, often based on real people and events that have “almost” happened. Still active as a border and security consultant, Jim now lives in New Mexico with his family.
