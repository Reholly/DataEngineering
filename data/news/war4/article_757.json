    "text": "January 3, 2024, is the fourth anniversary of the martyrdom of Lt. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, commander of the Quds Force of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC). Hajj Qassem was assassinated by US occupation forces in Iraq alongside his longtime friend and colleague Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, Iraq's Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) Second-in-Command. We only knew after his martyrdom that martyr Hajj Qassem was the mastermind behind West Asia's axis of resistance, but today in the aftermath of the Al Aqsa Flood operation in occupied Palestine and the supporting fronts in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Yemen we not only see his blessed touch, we feel his presence with every call cried out by resistance movements as they fight back the aggression of both Zionist Israel and the US occupation in our region. To discuss the role of Martyr Hajj Qassem Soleimani in this glorious, unified battle and the rising capabilities of resistance factions across West Asia, with us from Beirut is his eminence Sayyed Hachem Saffieddine, Head of the Islamic Resistance Hezbollah Executive Council in Lebanon.
