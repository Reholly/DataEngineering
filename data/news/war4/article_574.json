Israel has been doing things with impunity and someone has to call them to order,” Logart told Anadolu.\nBoycotts, divestments, sanctions\nMametlwe Sebei, president of the General Industries Workers Union of South Africa, said the move was a welcome step,\n“Although, it must be said that it is more symbolic and calculated for effect than anything meaningful,” he told Anadolu. “We can expect that nothing substantial will come of it.”\nSebei believes South Africa should do more in respect of things within their control such as cutting off diplomatic ties with Israel, imposing the boycotts, divestments and sanctions measures that target at regime and complicit corporations, as well as actively and materially supporting the Palestinian resistance. He said these are within South Africa’s means but the ICJ is not.\nPalestinian rights group Al-Haq also welcomed the application describing it as “a principled move to pursue justice for Israel’s Genocide.”\nAnadolu Agency website contains only a portion of the news stories offered to subscribers in the AA News Broadcasting System (HAS), and in summarized form.
