    "text": "In a place they loved so much : A group of Montfort runners, a lake located near the settlement of Ma'a lot in the north, held a race last Friday in memory of two officers with the rank of lieutenant colonel who fell during the war: Lt. Col. Alim Abdallah, 300th Brigade Sergeant, who was killed on the northern front, and Lt. Col. Salman Habka, commander of the 53rd Sufa Battalion, who was killed on the southern front.\nThe race was attended by runners from all over the country, from all ethnicities and ages who came to pay their respects and run a 10 km race. The runners were started by Mona, the widow of Alim Abdullah and Sharona Shalev Meiri. At the end of the race, each participant received a sticker with pictures of the fallen, a bracelet and a shirt. Abdullah's widow and Habeqa's father eulogized their loved ones and thanked the participants.\nWidow of Lt. Col. Alim Abdallah, and Imad Habka, father of Lt. Col. Salman, Photo: Jamal Ali and Bilal Barakat\n\"Over the years, we were privileged to run alongside Salman and Alim, two extraordinary people who lived life as they believed and never gave up on themselves. They both incorporate in their lives the traits of their runner and in their running the qualities of their lives. They were not only talented people, they were also excellent officers and commanders,\" said Golani Brigade leader and member Bassem Seef, who also participated in the race.\n\"Salman and Alim were characterized by a combination of three main qualities: sensitivity, excellence and courage. Salman and Alim were brave men and fighters, striving for contact and sticking to the mission. These qualities were reflected in their lives at home, in the army and also in running. Today we run in their memory.\"\nWrong? We'll fix it! If you find a mistake in the article, please share with us",
