    "text": "World War II Veteran celebrates his 99th birthday GAINESVILLE, Fla. (WCJB) - Jesse McDonald was born in Gainesville on Dec. 27,1924. Over the weekend, his family held a surprise party for him. Jesse McDonald joined the army when he was 16 and served in World War II. His family says he used to tell them all about being at Pearl Harbor and other war experiences. His son Dennis spoke for him during the party. “There were a family of nine of us. My father worked three jobs at one time, but he made sure we did not miss a meal,” Dennis McDonald shared. After the war, he came back to Gainesville in 1958 after he finished being stationed in Georgia. “Back in his time, it was hard for people of color so you had to try to make wise and good decision that would take you into your future,” Dennis McDonald said. He worked at First National Bank for around 30 years, but was a custodian for his first 15 years there. After that, he worked his way up to a higher role of working in the vault, and transporting checks from various banks in Gainesville over to the Federal Reserve building in Jacksonville. “We were very disciplined, if we did something wrong we paid the price for it. From those whippings that we got it taught us and it took us further down the road,” Dennis McDonald shared. Dennis McDonald says his father is the one who inspired him to join the Air Force where he served four and a half years. Jesse McDonald retired in his late 60s and loved to sing including singing in several church groups. He says he’s learned a lot over his 99 years but the major concepts he has always kept in mind are- “Honesty, loving people, try to surround yourself with good people. Be in a good environment,” Dennis McDonald shared. While celebrating his 99th birthday he says that 99 years is not enough and he’s going for 105.
