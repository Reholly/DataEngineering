He said the informal conversation between Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan on the margins of the meeting of the CIS heads of state in St.Petersburg was assessed by the Azerbaijani side as a fruitful and constructive engagement to promote the peace agenda between the two countries. \"From Azerbaijan's perspective we don't see any major obstacles for completion of a peace treaty between the two country,\" Hikmat Hajiyev said. \"It is difficult to put any concrete timelimes and further negotiations are still required between Armenia and Azerbaijan to finalize the process,\" he said.",
