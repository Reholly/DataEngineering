    "text": "Philippe Clement's first Old Firm game as Rangers boss has ended in defeat as goals from Paulo Bernardo and Kyogo Furuhashi gave Celtic a 2-1 win at Parkhead.\nThe Belgian had gone 16 games unbeaten since taking over from Michael Beale in October but with no away fans inside the ground due to an allocation dispute between the two clubs, it was always going to be the acid test for the injury-hit visitors on Saturday.\nThe Ibrox side started the game positively before Hoops midfielder Bernardo scored after 25 minutes, with the Gers missing at least a couple of good chances to level.\nCeltic's prolific striker Furuhashi curled in a second from 20 metres less than two minutes after the restart and there was more woe for the Light Blues in the 71st minute when defender Leon Balogun was shown a straight red card by referee Nick Walsh for denying Daizen Maeda a clear goalscoring opportunity.\nRangers hung on and skipper James Tavernier fired in a wonderful free-kick in the 88th minute but the comeback could not be completed in the eight added minutes.\nIt enabled Celtic to move eight points clear of their Glasgow neighbours at the top of the Premiership and, despite Celtic having played two games more, the victory could be the springboard to yet another title win as the Bhoys continue the hegemony they enjoyed under Ange Postecoglou.",
