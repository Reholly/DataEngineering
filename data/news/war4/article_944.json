    "text": "Posterities of war veterans and those of merit who had passed away long ago participated in events held in celebration of the 70th anniversary of victory in the Fatherland Liberation War.\nThey know feats and merits performed by their grandparents through books and newspapers or from stories of their mothers. But the feats and merits were getting dim in their memory.\nChon Sun Gum, a researcher of the Korean Association of Social Scientists, is one of them.\nHer grandfather is Chon Se Bong (February 10, 1915-April 18, 1986). He is the former chairman of the Central Committee of the Writers Union of Korea. He was a famous writer of the Korean literary circles.\nAmong his works, the typical one is the novel A New Spring in Sokgaeul (1957-1960). The novel was followed by a TV serial under the same title, and it is still popular. His novels The Dawn of the Revolution (1973), The Galaxy (1982), Korea in Spring (posthumous work, 1991) and so on are the cycle of novels “Immortal History” which depicts President Kim Il Sung. He also wrote the novel Best Wish (1980), several medium-length and short novels and stories, essays, traveler’s journal and a long memoir “Writer’s Study of 40 Years”.\nThe respected Comrade Kim Jong Un called Chon Se Bong one of the unforgettable revolutionary comrades who had been loyal and patriotic, at the Seventh Congress of the Workers’ Party of Korea. Kim Jong Un saw that his granddaughter participated in the events held to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the victory in the Fatherland Liberation War in place of her grandfather.\nChon Sun Gum who was back with the pride in her grandfather wrote a letter of gratitude and a new pledge to out of mind of her grandfather who lies in the Patriotic Martyrs’ Cemetery and of her own.\nKim Jong Un’s love and trust bring up all rising generations in the DPRK into a powerful force of the socialist construction.",
