The total amount of the satisfied claims is more than USD 27 million (which is the equivalent of more than one billion hryvnias),\" the Ministry said. This is the largest amount of all the arbitrations currently being conducted by the Ministry of Defense. According to the decision of the international arbitration, interest per annum continues to be accrued on the value of the undelivered goods until the debt is paid. Please wait...",
