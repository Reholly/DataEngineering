    "text": "2023-12-31 06:44:12 Photographer Ziv Koren accompanied Miya Shem, who returned after 55 days in captivity, in a harrowing journey back to safety. Shem, who had been held captive by Hamas terrorists, was finally able to return to Kibbutz Nirim with the help of Koren. The journey was filled with incredible and emotional moments, including the discovery of a Kalashnikov bullet in Shemâ€™s arm, a shirt that miraculously survived an attack by Black Sabbath, and the simple but delicious food waiting for her at home. Upon their arrival, Hamas terrorists also arrived at Kibbutz Nirim, putting the residents and security forces on high alert. There was a heroic battle as the standby squad fought against dozens of terrorists, with the commander of the southern brigade ultimately preventing a potentially disastrous situation. In the midst of this chaos, there have also been heartwarming initiatives to support the evacuees and fighters. Equipment has been collected for the residents of the south and the soldiers, as well as free repair services and other forms of support. These initiatives serve as a reminder of the resilience and unity of the community in the face of adversity. #ynet #news #economy #sports #health",
