    "text": "2023-12-27 23:50:31 Proactive and determined Royal action in favor of strengthening the social state December 27, 2023 Driven by a proactive and determined will and a deep and unshakeable faith in the need to ensure the conditions of a dignified and decent life for all segments of society, His Majesty King Mohammed VI has, since His accession to the Throne of His glorious Ancestors, worked to strengthen the social State and promote balanced, inclusive and sustainable development. Being no exception, the year 2023 was marked by the launch of several projects and programs intended to improve citizens’ access to basic health services, strengthen their capacity to access decent housing and consolidate cohesion. family, and thus ensure greater social justice and equity. His Majesty the King has, in fact, never ceased to multiply initiatives and magnanimous gestures with a view to democratizing access to health care, within the framework of a proximity policy, to improve the health of people with specific needs, the elderly, or suffering from chronic illnesses, and to ensure the health sovereignty of the Kingdom. These initiatives and actions were reinforced by the inauguration, on April 28, of the University Hospital Center “Mohammed VI” of Tangier, a medical center of excellence which will allow, thanks to its Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy, to structure the care offer in the Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima region, to attract new medical skills and to offer cutting-edge training to new generations of professionals. In this regard, it should also be noted the inauguration, during the same month of April, of the Psycho-social Rehabilitation Center of the Ibn Rochd University Hospital in Casablanca and of a Local Medical Center-Mohammed V Foundation for Solidarity in the new town of Errahma in the Municipality of Dar Bouaaza (Casablanca), two solidarity projects which attest to the central role that His Majesty the King grants to strengthening basic health services and bringing them closer to citizens. Added to these projects is the program for the deployment of connected mobile medical units, intended to improve access to medical services for rural residents. This pilot program is part of the Royal project to reform the health system and generalize social protection and represents a new intervention model that combines local care and telemedicine. As part of strengthening citizens’ abilities to access decent housing, a new housing assistance program has been put in place for the period 2024-2028. It aims to renew the approach to supporting access to property and to support the purchasing power of households, through direct financial assistance to the buyer. Moroccans residing in Morocco or abroad, who are not property owners in Morocco and who have never benefited from housing assistance, are eligible. This new program will, on a social level, facilitate access to housing for low-income social classes and the middle class, reduce the housing deficit and accelerate the completion of the program.Cities Without Slums”. Added to this is the direct social assistance program which will, thanks to its direct impact on targeted families, raise their standard of living, fight against poverty and precariousness and, ultimately, improve the indicators of social and human development. In this regard, the head of government, Mr. Aziz Akhannouch affirmed that around one million families, or the equivalent of 3.5 million Moroccans, meeting the required eligibility threshold of the Unified Social Register will benefit, from from December 28, of the first tranche of direct social assistance. Furthermore, the family being the basic unit of society, His Majesty King Mohammed VI has always “required to protect” this institution, by launching major projects and major reforms in its favor and ensuring that favorable conditions are created to strengthen its cohesion. It is within this framework that the letter addressed by the Sovereign to the head of government to initiate the revision of the Family Code (the Moudawana), is inspired by national values which include the family and family ties in the sphere of the sacred. Aware of the relationship between social development and economic growth, His Majesty the King has always taken particular interest in the promotion of the industrial sector, considered an essential lever and a catalyst for inclusive and sustainable socio-economic development. Over the last two decades, Morocco has been able, thanks to the enlightened vision of the Sovereign, to make significant progress in this sector, relying on ambitious strategies designed to make the industry a major provider of jobs, a stimulator of productive investment and a vector of growth and development. The Kingdom has today become an essential global destination in cutting-edge sectors, such as the aeronautical industry for which the Kingdom constitutes an attractive platform or the automobile sector, of which Morocco has become a continental leader. The latest demonstration to date this “success story” is the birth of the first Moroccan automobile brand for the general public, the first model of which was presented to His Majesty the King on May 15. Supported by national skills, this project mainly relies on the ecosystem of local automotive equipment manufacturers developed by the Kingdom. However, these results could not be achieved without qualified human capital capable of supporting the implementation of different sectoral development strategies. It is within this framework that the new roadmap relating to the development of professional training falls, the spearhead of which is the Cité des Métiers et des Compétences (CMC) program. This program, which mobilizes a total forecast investment of 4.4 billion dirhams, provides for the creation of 12 CMCs in the different regions of the Kingdom, which will be multi-sectoral professional training platforms and will welcome, each year, 34,000 trainees. The year 2023 was also marked by the inauguration by His Majesty the King, in the city of Tamesna, of the City of Trades and Skills in the region of Rabat-Salé-Kénitra, the 4th City to open its doors to welcome young people in training, after those of Souss-Massa, Oriental and Laâyoune-Sakia-El Hamra which started training between October and November 2022.
