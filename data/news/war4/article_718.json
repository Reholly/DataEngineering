    "text": "The Glace Bay Panthers have come out of the Christmas break rolling, beating the Riverview Ravens 5-2 in the battle of the Cape Breton High School Hockey League’s top teams.\nAt the Cape Breton County Recreation Centre, a three-goal second period vaulted the Panthers (11-1-1-0) into the lead. They held on for the win\nColby Rudderham opened the scoring for Riverview (6-6-1-1) in the first period. No one scored until 8:12 left in the middle frame when Kyle Nearing tied the game on a Glace Bay penalty kill.\nThat swung the momentum the Panthers’ way, as Kale MacDonald gave the visitors the lead only one minute and nine seconds later. Garrett MacIntosh of the Panthers and Riverview’s Owen Buckley traded goals before the period ended with Glace Bay leading 3-2.\nIt stayed that way until the final 2:30 of the third period, when Cohen McNeil beat Riverview goalie Kayden Mollons to make it 4-2. MacIntosh scored Glace Bay’s fifth tally a minute later.\nBrandon Cole took the win between the pipes for the Panthers, stopping 18 of 20 shots directed his way. Mollons turned aside 14 in the defeat.\nWith the win, it’s Glace Bay’s sixth consecutive regular-season victory. They last lost on Dec. 8 to the Dalbrae Dragons 4-2, during the 2023 Panther Classic which the Panthers would eventually win. Glace Bay’s most recent regular season loss came against the Ravens 3-2 in overtime on Nov. 19.\nHigh school hockey action continues Saturday with the final two matchups of 2023. The Memorial Marauders and Sydney Academy Wildcats clash at the Membertou Sports & Wellness Centre at 12 p.m. Later in the day at 7 p.m., Glace Bay will welcome Riverview to the Glace Bay Miners Forum for a rematch of Friday.",
