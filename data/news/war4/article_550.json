They have also called on the government to treat Assam’s flood and soil erosion problems as a national priority. Shah said all demands will be fulfilled and a panel will be formed to monitor the implementation of the accord.\nViolence down by 87%\nAmit Shah said violence is down by 87% in Assam\nHe claimed that 10,000 people lost their since 1979 in violence by ULFA",
