    "text": "We stand united in the pursuit of justice and sovereignty for the resilient people of Haiti. History has repeatedly witnessed the detrimental impact of foreign interventions on Haiti, from Napoleon's attempt to reinstate slavery in 1802 to the U.S. invasion in 1915, which resulted in the theft of Haiti's gold reserve and the imposition of racial segregation. More recently, the introduction of cholera by UN troops after the 2010 earthquake claimed the lives of 30,000 Haitians. Now, there's a concerning proposal to deploy Kenyan troops to Haiti to address gang-related issues. The recent expulsion of these same troops from the Democratic Republic of Congo due to collusion with gangs raises alarming red flags. We adamantly reject any foreign military presence in Haiti and, instead, call for support in empowering the Haitian military and BSAP and the national police force to address domestic challenges. Our petition implores the international community to heed the lessons of history, respect Haiti's sovereignty, and refrain from actions that may inadvertently harm the very people they aim to assist. Together, let us champion a future for Haiti that is free from external interventions, allowing the nation to chart its course towards self-determination and prosperity.",
