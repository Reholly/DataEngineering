    "text": "Manny Pacquiao announced he will fight Floyd Mayweather again - eight years after their 'Fight of the Century' clash. The Pac-Man has been teasing a return to the squared circle for many years. Conor McGregor recently claimed he and Pacquiao were being touted for a match in Saudi Arabia, when the Irishman was set next to Cristiano Ronaldo for the 'Day of Reckoning' fight card. However, Pacquiao, 45, appears confident he will be fighting his former nemesis in a monumental clash in Japan. After the Filipino boxing legend, who retired in 2021 with an extraordinary record of 62 wins and eight losses, made his announcement, the world of combat sports became excited.

Thank you for always supporting ‘RIZIN’ promotions.” Mayweather is yet to respond to Pacquiao's announcement. Do you want to see Floyd Mayweather fight Manny Pacquiao again? Let us know in the comment section below The boxing legend, who retired in 2017 with a flawless 50-0 record, has been fighting in numerous exhibition bouts since he retired. As well as taking on YouTubers such as Logan Paul and Deji Olatunji, he also fought Japanese kick-boxer Tenshin Nasukawa during another exhibition bout in Japan in 2019. It's currently unclear when Pacquiao thinks they will be able to have their rematch. In November, Mayweather announced he would be fighting John Gotti III for a second time, but is yet to clarify any finer details including the date or the location. It is not the first time Pacquiao has said he will fight Mayweather in Japan. In October, he said he would be taking on the Michigan native just before Christmas . He said: “I have an exhibition match coming in December in Japan,” said Manny Pacquiao in media reports. “We’re working on the opponent. We’re working with Mayweather. Yes,”",
