    "text": "2023-12-30 03:32:03 A little over a year ago, the Ministry of Defense embarked on a mission whose tasks are more than well known to the Spanish military: the training of soldiers from other countries, something they have done and do in Iraq, Mali, Afghanistan, Central African Republic… But on this occasion the classes would be taught in Spain and the students would be civilians and military personnel from Ukraine. Then, the Department led by Margarita Robles calculated that by the end of this year 2023, the Armed Forces would have trained just over 2,000 Ukrainians. However, the Government’s commitment to this mission of the European Union (EUMAM-Ukraine) has raised that number to around 3,500 students. This is one of the milestones that Defense considers more than accomplished, as highlighted in its assessment of the year ending, in which it also makes a brief review of the military and humanitarian material sent to Kyiv. “Since the beginning of the conflict, the Ministry of Defense has shown its support for Ukraine by sending defensive material, humanitarian assistance and training,” they recall without forgetting to add the data that places our country as one of the most active in this training operation: «Since the beginning of the war with Russia, some 3,500 Ukrainian soldiers have been trained by our Armed Forces, which have offered more than 80 training modules, making Spain the third European contributor to the training of Ukrainian personnel ». A training that for many of the students was their first contact with the military world, since many were civilians recruited for the conflict. Spanish uniformed personnel from both Armies and the Navy have participated in this mission – and for the moment will continue to do so – and have acted as teachers. On average, between 300 and 400 troops have been involved. Ukrainian soldiers receive training at the Toledo Infantry AcademyJavier Fdez.-LargoPHOTOGRAPHERS Thus, the Army has taught courses on Basic Training, Maintenance of Armored Tracked Transport Vehicle, Crew Member of the “Leopard” Battle Tank (already completed), Health Care for Combat Casualties, Countering Improvised Explosive Devices, Assault Operations in Forest, Combat Sapper, Advanced Combat Course, Demining, Operations Planning, Military Operations in Urban Terrain, “Hawk” Anti-Aircraft Missile, 105/14 Howitzer Crews, Advanced Artillery Observer, Geospatial Analysis and Cyberdefense. The Navy personnel, for their part, have been instructors in the Basic Training and Operations Planning courses, with the participation of units such as the Marine Corps. Along with them, those from the Air and Space Army teach the “Aspide” Air Support Driving and Anti-Aircraft Missile modules. Many of these courses focus on the management of weapons donated by Spain to the Ukrainian Army. Toledo Infantry Academy A school with classes spread throughout the country and directed by the Operations Command (MOPS). For its management, it has the “Toledo Training Coordination Center” (TTCC), a structure for direction, coordination and execution of training plans orchestrated from the Burgos General Headquarters and whose largest classroom is the Toledo Infantry Academy. There is, among others, the Combat Training Unit, which provides basic training for civilians who will enlist in the Ukrainian Army and other more specific training such as health. Support that, as confirmed by the Government, will continue and will adapt to the requests of the Ukrainian authorities, who are the ones who transmit their training needs to the TTCC. In fact, the Council of Ministers approved, at its meeting on Tuesday, the agreement that extends until December 31, 2024 the participation of units of the Armed Forces in military missions. And one of those that will continue is EUMAM UKRAINE, with 300 instructors “on average” in a contribution that “varies depending on the training modules activated,” details the Executive. [[H3:Misión: ayudar a los que «sufren la invasión enemiga»]] Currently, Spain’s participation in this EU training mission is in its third rotation, with the “Guzmán el Bueno” Brigade X of Córdoba as the reference unit and with Brigadier General Ignacio Olazábal Elorz at the head of those 300-400 teachers who on average participate simultaneously. In his speech on the day he took charge of the operation, on December 5, he highlighted the “honor” and “challenge” of “joining this commitment in order to contribute to the improvement of the combat capabilities of those who suffer the enemy invasion in their home. #Spain #trained #Ukrainian #soldiers #civilians",
