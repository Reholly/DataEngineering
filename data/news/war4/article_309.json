    "text": "â€¦throughout 2023, there were no acts of terrorism in Indonesia. This is an indication that the situation of security in Indonesia is improving.Jakarta (ANTARA) - The National Police's anti-terror squad, Special Detachment 88 (Densus 88), together with the Indonesian Military (TNI), arrested 148 suspected terrorists this year. Head of the National Counter-Terrorism Agency (BNPT), Rycko Amelza Dahniel, made the statement while delivering the year-end press release of the BNPT in Sentul, Bogor, West Java, on Friday. According to him, most of the suspected terrorists had links with the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) and the Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) terror groups. JI and JAD are the two biggest terror networks in Indonesia and are directly affiliated with Al Qaeda and ISIS terrorist groups, Dahniel noted. He said that the arrests of the 148 suspected terrorists were linear with the decline in acts of terrorism in Indonesia. Throughout this year, not a single act of terror was recorded in the country. \"Even though there were still a number of terror attacks in several countries, throughout 2023, there were no acts of terrorism in Indonesia. This is an indication that the situation of security in Indonesia is improving,\" he added. However, he appealed to all parties to stay alert against the dynamics of terrorist networks that enter society. Global terrorism networks are still carrying out acts of terror with women and children as their main targets, he said. \"We must not be complacent. Radical acts against vulnerable groups, namely women, children, and teenagers, are still occurring,\" he stressed.
