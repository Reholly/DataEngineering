    "text": "EL PASO, Texas (KFOX14/CBS4) â€” A Borderland resident is setting out on a journey that will cover more than 1,000 miles by foot to bring awareness to America's disabled veterans community and other people in need. Purple Heart recipient Wayne Weaver, 63, is due to leave a Loves Truck Stop in Horizon Jan. 4, on a journey that will take him from El Paso to Fort Worth, followed by Norman, Oklahoma and back down to Houston. Along the way, Weaver will visit veterans -- including his uncle, a Purple Heart recipient and Three Bronze Star Veteran, who is buried at Evergreen Cemetery in Houston -- with his two German shepherds and a wagon carrying his belongings in tow. \"There's nothing I wouldn't do for people that need help and veterans that need help, and even sick and handicapped kids,\" said Weaver. Weaver is embarking on the trip out of his own pocket, however, should you see him walking in your neighborhood, donations are appreciated.
