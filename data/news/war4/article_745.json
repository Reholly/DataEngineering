    "text": "The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported that the Kerem Shalom crossing, a key entry point into Gaza, has reopened for aid delivery after a temporary suspension. The closure, which lasted several days, was attributed to “security incidents.”\nOn Friday, 81 trucks loaded with food and medical supplies made their way into Gaza through both the Kerem Shalom crossing from Israel and the Rafah crossing from Egypt. However, OCHA expressed concern that the current level of aid is significantly lower than what is needed in the region. Prior to October 7, about 455 trucks carrying commercial goods were entering Gaza daily.\nThe Kerem Shalom crossing had been closed from December 25 to 28 due to security-related events, including a deadly drone strike on December 25, local communities intercepting food convoys, and unexpected transfers of prisoners and casualties from Israel disrupting operations.\nOn Friday, Tal Heinrich, a spokesperson for the Israeli prime minister, explained that the UN had requested the crossing’s closure on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday to conduct aid inspections amid congestion on the Gaza side. Heinrich emphasized that Israel is not restricting the amount of humanitarian aid entering Gaza, dismissing any claims to the contrary as inaccurate.",
