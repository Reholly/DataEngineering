    "text": "Vietnam Veteran Who Battled Terminal Cancer Alone Honored With a Hero’s Burial in Massachusetts ‘May God bless Charlie Connolly, and all who took the time to Stand for Charlie. Today, we were his family and now, he is finally home,’ State Rep. Steve Xiarhos wrote in a tribute Published |Updated\nZachary Rogers\nHundreds gathered to honor Army Veteran Charles “Charlie” Connolly. State Representative Steve Xiarhos/Facebook\nDozens of strangers and one long-lost friend gathered Friday to honor a Vietnam veteran who has passed away after battling terminal cancer alone.\nArmy Veteran Charles “Charlie” Connolly, 78, was homeless and had no family at the time of his death on Dec. 18, according to Massachusetts State Rep. Steve Xiarhos. For that reason, the public was invited to attend Connolly’s funeral at the Massachusetts National Cemetery in Bourne. “Hundreds” showed up, Xiarhos says.\n“Charlie’s story is a powerful reminder of the challenges many of our veterans face after their service,” Xiarhos said in a Facebook post. “His journey, marked by courage and resilience, ended in the compassionate care of the Veterans Affairs Hospice Unit in Brockton. Despite the lack of family by his side, Charlie’s spirit was never alone.”\nXiarhos, who says he is a Gold Star father, adds that he understands “the pain of loss and the importance of remembrance.”\n“My own journey of grief has taught me that we, as a community, must be the family for those who have none,” Xiarhos added. “In honoring Charlie, we not only pay tribute to his life and service but also uphold our duty to support and remember every veteran who has served our nation.”\nConnolly was buried in the state’s national cemetery among 78,000 other heroes in what was a full military funeral according to the state representative. After hearing about Connolly’s passing and funeral on the local news, an old friend of the veteran was able to reach out and attend the service, even receiving Connolly’s burial flag, Boston 25 News reports.\n“As we laid Charlie to rest in this hallowed grounds… let his memory be a beacon that guides our actions in supporting our veterans,” Xiarhos said in his post. “May God bless Charlie Connolly, and all who took the time to Stand for Charlie. Today, we were his family and now, he is finally home.”\nView post on Twitter",
