    "text": "New Delhi: Home Minister Amit Shah on Friday hailed the signing of a peace deal with the pro-talks faction of the insurgent group ULFA as a new era of peace for the country’s northeastern region which will be free of any disturbance and violence. “This is a new start of a era of peace for the whole Northeast especially Assam. I want to assure ULFA representatives, who have shown trust in the government of India, that a programme will be made from the side of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) in a time-bound manner to fulfil everything, before you asking for it. Under MHA, a committee will be formed, which will work with the Assam government to fulfil this agreement,” he said. ULFA the oldest insurgent group of Assam agreed to abjure the path of violence. Speaking on the signing of a memorandum of settlement with ULFA. [https://t.co/6H1DIHmmHy] — Amit Shah (@AmitShah) [December 29, 2023] The pro-dialogue faction of the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) officially inked a peace agreement with both the Centre and the Assam government, committing to leave the path of violence and integrate into mainstream society. The agreement was signed in the presence of Amit Shah and Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma. The deal came after 12 years of continuing negotiations between the government and the ULFA faction led by Arabinda Rajkhowa. This significant peace deal is expected to bring an end to decades-long insurgency in Assam. ULFA’s hardline faction under the leadership of Paresh Baruah did not participate in the agreement. Baruah is reportedly in an area along the China-Myanmar border. Formed in 1979 with the demand of “sovereign Assam”, ULFA has since been associated with activities considered subversive, prompting the central government to outlaw the group in 1990. The Rajkhowa-led faction commenced peace discussions with the government on September 3, 2011, following the signing of an agreement for Suspension of Operations (SoO) between their faction and the central and state administrations.
