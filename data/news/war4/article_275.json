    "text": "Two local WWII veterans meet for the first time Published 8:00 am Friday, December 29, 2023 Jesse Powers, 99 a lifelong resident of Chocowinity, and Roscoe Joyner, 104 and now a resident of Belhaven, both fought in the European theatre during World War II. On December 18th of this year the two had the opportunity to meet for the very first time at Joyners’ home in Belhaven. They greeted one another with a warm handshake and gracious smiles, and for the next 90 minutes or so, they shared their “war stories” with one another in only a way that two WWII veterans could tell and understand. And though they never served together, there was an immediate bond between the two of them as they talked about the good and the bad of life on the frontlines. And to no surprise, they really had more in common with one another than they could have ever imagined. Such as the times they both saw General George Patton, their remembrances of the German people, the pranks and mischievous things they would often do to ease the stress of war, and their mutual love of fishing. When they decided it was time to call it a day, both eagerly agreed they wanted to get back together, as they had more tales to spin for another day. The full audio recording of their conversation can be heard above and at https://vimeo.com/898474770?share=copy#t=0. Powers’ individual story can be read [here](https://www.thewashingtondailynews.com/2023/11/18/99-year-old-wwii-vet-shares-his-story/). Joyner’s individual story can be read [ here](https://www.thewashingtondailynews.com/2023/11/26/world-war-ii-vet-still-haunted-by-the-horrors-of-war/).",
