    "text": "Indian Army Awards Contract to Johnnette Technologies for Supply of Made-in-India Johnnette JF-2 Tactical, India’s First Crash Resistant Drone Johnnette Technologies, a leading Indian Unmanned Systems manufacturer headquartered in Noida, has secured a contract from the Indian Army to supply its flagship tactical fixed-wing UAV, the Johnnette JF-2, for border surveillance. The company proudly asserts that the JF-2 is India’s first crash-resistant drone, representing a significant milestone in the nation’s pursuit of self-reliance in defense manufacturing. Founded in 2014 by Lt Cdr John Livingstone, a retired Indian Navy officer, Johnnette Technologies has been at the forefront of developing cutting-edge unmanned systems technology for both military and commercial applications in India. The company’s commitment aligns with the ‘Make in India’ initiative spearheaded by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. Lt Cdr John Livingstone, Founder, and CEO of Johnnette Technologies, expressed his pride in contributing to national security: “It is a great feeling to be able to serve the nation even after retiring from the Defence Forces. My team has done prolonged R&D and have created this tactical fixed-wing UAV, Johnnette JF-2, for the Military requirements. The uniqueness of our lightweight JF-2 is its ability to be crash-resistant in multiple terrains due to its sturdy belly-landing design.” The Johnnette JF-2 is a hand-launched fixed-wing tactical UAV designed specifically for surveillance and reconnaissance operations. Equipped with a high-definition day camera and a thermal imaging camera, the platform is tailored for day and night operations. Noteworthy features include a crash-proof avionics bay, anti-jamming, and anti-spoofing capabilities, making it an ideal solution for land forces. This marks the first deployment of a fixed-wing UAV in its class by the Indian Army for border surveillance. Johnnette Technologies Pvt Ltd., established in November 2014, has been a trailblazer in Unmanned Systems Technology in India. The company has consistently delivered cutting-edge aerospace systems to the paramilitary, commercial, aerospace, and defense sectors, with a primary focus on unmanned systems technology. In addition to the Johnnette JF-2, the company also manufactures low-cost loitering munitions (Kamikaze drones) and has ambitious plans to produce Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles (UCAVs) in the future. As India continues to strengthen its indigenous defense capabilities, Johnnette Technologies’ innovative contributions underscore the growing role of domestic firms in meeting the evolving requirements of the armed forces.
