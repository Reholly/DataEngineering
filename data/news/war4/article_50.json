Nearly seven months after the band released the music video for \" [Crushed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSav7HayxtI),\" one of the project's leading stars is receiving a brand-new home. \"One year ago, our friend @ty__arnold met a 14-year-old boy named Sashko in Ukraine,\" Imagine Dragons and UNITED24 said in a joint [Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/C1aQjz2NFiE/) on Thursday. \"He was wandering the streets of his destroyed town of Novohryhorivka, still in disbelief of the complete destruction of his home, his neighborhood and his school.\" \"@ty__arnold captured Sashko's story in our music video for 'Crushed,'\" the statement explained. \"Thanks to UNITED24 (which we support) and their donor @avrora.multimarket, Sashko and his mother's house has been rebuilt.\" Following six months of construction, Sashko was able to receive the keys to his new house. He also received a special message from the members of Imagine Dragons. \"We are so incredibly proud of you,\" lead singer [Dan Reynolds](https://themessenger.com/entertainment/dan-reynolds-loveloud-imagine-dragons-lgbtq-issues-exclusive) told Sashko when he was able to open the doors. \"You have inspired us. You've inspired thousands of people across the globe. Thank you to all the incredible donors who made this happen. And above all, Sashko, welcome home.\" [Ukraine War in Data: Rebuilding Ukraine — for three-quarters of a trillion dollars](/grid/ukraine-war-in-data-rebuilding-ukraine-for-three-quarters-of-a-trillion-dollars?utm_source=onsite&utm_medium=related_story) [The Ukraine War in data: $349 billion (the low estimate) for rebuilding Ukraine](/grid/the-ukraine-war-in-data-349-billion-the-low-estimate-for-rebuilding-ukraine?utm_source=onsite&utm_medium=related_story) [Ukraine war in photos: Russia’s ‘frenzied push’ in the east](/grid/ukraine-war-in-photos-russias-frenzied-push-in-the-east?utm_source=onsite&utm_medium=related_story) [Russia’s biggest celebrities are taking sides on the Ukraine war – and the Kremlin is crushing the dissenters](/grid/russias-biggest-celebrities-are-taking-sides-on-the-ukraine-war-and-the-kremlin-is-crushing-the-dissenters?utm_source=onsite&utm_medium=related_story) [The Ukraine War in data: Russia’s $160 billion war plans](/grid/the-ukraine-war-in-data-russias-160-billion-war-plans?utm_source=onsite&utm_medium=related_story) [In Russia’s war against Ukraine, are ‘a coup or a nuke’ the only endgames left?](/grid/in-russias-war-against-ukraine-are-a-coup-or-a-nuke-the-only-endgames-left?utm_source=onsite&utm_medium=related_story) [privacy policy](/info/privacy-policy)and [terms of use](/info/terms-of-use). - Disney to Release ‘Alien’ Book for Preschoolers for Film’s 45th AnniversaryEntertainment - ESPN Anchor Shares Update on 7-Month-Old Son’s Health After Being Airlifted to HospitalEntertainment - Trump Claims Cameo in ‘Home Alone 2’ Made Movie ‘Big Success,’ Denies He Bullied His Way Into FilmEntertainment - Scott Disick Hits the Beach With Pre-Kardashian Ex Chloé Bartoli in St. BartsEntertainment - Kelly Clarkson Slept in Her Car Before ‘American Idol’ AuditionEntertainment - Jason Kelce Reacts to Seeing His Face (and Beard!) on 11-Year-Old’s Birthday CakeEntertainment - ‘Parasite’ Actor Asked Police to Keep Drug Investigation Private Days Before Apparent Suicide: ReportEntertainment - Sarah Palin and Boyfriend Ron Duguay Party With Drew Carey and Brian Williams at Steven Van Zandt’s Cop Charity BallEntertainment - Lance Bass Teases Potential *NSYNC ReunionEntertainment - Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco Share Sweet Moment During Art Exhibit Date: See PhotosEntertainment - ‘Mama June: Family Crisis’ Preview Shows ‘Family’s Toughest Battle Yet’ Before Chickadee’s DeathEntertainment - ‘The Originals’ Stars Candice King and Steven Krueger Are DatingEntertainment",
