    "text": "NEWBURYPORT — After learning of the centuries old case of Newburyport Special Officer Alexander Griffin, City Marshal Mark Murray is hopeful that the officer who died in the line of duty will soon be recognized by the National Law Enforcement Memorial as part of National Police Week. Founded in 1984, the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund a nonprofit organization dedicated to honoring the fallen, telling the story of American Law Enforcement and making it safer for those who serve. The organization built and continues to maintain the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, the nation’s monument to law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty. The Memorial Fund is a principal organizer of the National Police Week observance each May and hosts a candlelight vigil each May 13, to honor all fallen officers. In addition, the Memorial Fund maintains the largest, most comprehensive database of line-of-duty officer deaths, conducts research into officer fatality trends and issues, and serves as an information clearinghouse. On July 20, 1879, Special Officer Griffin died due to complications of a beating suffered when he was attacked while attempting to quell a disturbance on July 4. Murray said he was made aware of the case of Griffin back in 2017, though he cannot remember who it was who informed him. He explained that he reached out to the Massachusetts Memorial in the same year, which lead to the National Law Enforcement Memorial getting involved. “I took a shot. I wrote the letter. I said, it's pretty cool, and started the ball rolling, but it took this long,” Murray said. He said he heard back from Senior Research Manager Carolie Heyliger last week. “That was kind of out of nowhere. And what happens is they gather all this information, they determine him eligible as a line of duty death, and they send it to the board in January for consideration to put on the wall in May, Police Memorial Week,” Murray said. He shared his feelings on Griffin potentially being enshrined in the coming months, as well as his excitement to be able to include Griffin in the town’s own annual memorial going forward. “We'll read off the names of the three officers that had died in the line of duty for our department, and it was interesting to find out we had a fourth,” Murray said. He said that once they verified it was true, it was important to get him recognized. “I thought it was a neat project, and here it is. I'm pretty sure they're going to make a decision that he'll go on the wall,” Murray said.",
