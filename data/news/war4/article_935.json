    "text": "‘it feels good to be back in action’: ins vikrant equipped with guidance radar, surface to air missiles\nNew Delhi: India’s first indigenous aircraft carrier INS Vikrant now gets sophisticated guidance radar and surface-to-air missiles. The radars and missiles equipped on the aircraft carrier are – Multi-Function Surveillance, Track and Guidance Radar (MF-STAR) and Barak-8 Medium Range Surface to Air missiles (MRSAMs), reported NDTV.\nNotably, Indian destroyers of the Kolkata and Visakhapatnam class are already equipped with the MF-STAR-MRSAM combo. The MF-STAR detects airborne targets, including aircraft and anti-ship missiles. Meanwhile, MR-SAM can shoot down a target at a distance of more than 80 km.\nImages of aircraft and the MF-STAR-MRSAM combo are shared by the official account of INS Vikrant.\nImages of INS Vikrant:\nIndia’s second aircraft INS Vikrant was commissioned into the Indian Navy in September last year. INS Vikrant will be deployed on the eastern seaboard during Milan-2024, reported the media house.\nThe aircraft carrier weighing 45,000 tonnes was built at a cost of Rs 20,000 crore. The aircraft carrier is 262 metres long and 62 metres wide. The INS Vikrant can have 30 aircraft on board. The aircraft carrier was launched in August 2013. It was undocked on 10 June 2015 after the completion of structural work. It was delivered to the Indian Navy in July last year and commissioned into the force two months later.\nNotably, India is also in negotiations for procuring 26 Rafale-M aircraft for the Indian Navy.",
