    "text": "Phnom Penh, December 12 (ZXS) -- Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet said here on December 29 that Cambodia's \"win-win policy\" has brought peace, stability and development to the country over the past 29 years, benefiting Cambodia, its surrounding regions and other countries in the world. On the same day, Cambodia held a celebration of the 25th anniversary of the implementation of the \"win-win policy\" and the 5th anniversary of the establishment of the win-win monument in the capital Phnom Penh. This year's celebration will run from December 12 to 29. In 1998, then-Prime Minister Hun Sen proposed a \"win-win policy\" that ended Cambodia's civil war that lasted for more than 20 years. The above-mentioned \"win-win policy\" mainly includes three major connotations: ensuring the safety of people's lives, ensuring that people live and work in peace and contentment, and protecting people's property rights. Hun Manet called on the people to cherish the hard-won peace. He said the win-win monument is a symbol of peace and a symbol of history, and it reminds the younger generation of Cambodians to remember the historical fact that the country pursues peace. Hun Manet said that the end of the Cambodian civil war will help strengthen regional peace and promote the settlement of international affairs. Cambodia has always been committed to playing its role in maintaining regional stability, and has sent nearly 10,000 troops to United Nations peacekeeping operations and provided humanitarian demining training courses to war-torn countries. Local media reported that the \"win-win policy\" has led Cambodia to prosperity, rapid development of all walks of life, and great achievements in national construction. It is believed that under the leadership of the new government, Cambodia will achieve its goal of becoming a high-income country by 2050 and its people will live a happy and happy life. (ENDS)",
