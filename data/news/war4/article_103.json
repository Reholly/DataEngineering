    "text": "They have found refuge in Norfolk after fleeing the war in their homeland - and a series of special events helped Ukrainian children to celebrate Christmas. There are 560 Ukrainian children and young people currently living in Norfolk, following the Russian invasion of their country in February 2022. [Norfolk County Council has supported more than 2,000 Ukrainian nationals](https://www.edp24.co.uk/news/23243380.norfolk-ukrainian-refugee-support-pledge-county-council/), since the March 2022 launch of the Homes for Ukraine scheme - [which has seen families in the county open their doors to house refugees](https://www.edp24.co.uk/news/23587055.norfolk-hosts-needed-offer-homes-ukrainian-families/). Christmas can be a difficult time, with youngsters missing loved ones who have remained - or lost their lives - back at home. But, to spread festive cheer, a special Christmas Party for children aged 10 and under was held at the Early Childhood and Family base in Norwich's Hunter Road. Delighted children got the chance to create a Christmas tree and seasonal decorations, to enjoy Christmas gingerbread, to dance in a disco and to take home a present. The party was hosted by the county council's Ukrainian Parent Champions - volunteers who raise awareness of the services and support available to families. That followed a Christmas party for teenagers, held at the Norwich School last week and a festive-themed workshop of performing arts and design at the Garage in the city. Penny Carpenter, cabinet member for children's services at Norfolk County Council, said: \"These children and their families have left behind their home, family members and livelihood. \"We wanted to give them a chance to celebrate Christmas, while understanding that this is a particularly difficult time of year for those who have left behind or lost loved ones. “ [Our Ukrainian support programme](https://www.edp24.co.uk/news/20619289.its-like-dream-movie---ukrainian-refugees-finding-safety-norfolk/) has been very much led by the families themselves, with Ukrainian teachers joining our workforce and helping shape the support we offer. \"I am pleased to see that many of the children and young people are beginning to flourish here in Norfolk, building lives for themselves that are grounded in strength, perseverance and an unwavering commitment to their shared cultural identity. \"The overwhelming success of the Ukraine Support Team is a testament to the compassion and resilience of our community and the council’s dedication to creating a nurturing and inclusive environment for all residents.\"",
