    "text": "British medic who died in Ukraine ‘devoted her life to helping others’ Katherine Mielniczuk, 26, spent much of the last two years volunteering on the frontline after graduating from university. A British woman who died as a combat medic in Ukraine “devoted her life to helping others”, her family said. Katherine Mielniczuk went to Ukraine after Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, compelled to use her medical skills to help those in need. The 26-year-old, who graduated in chemistry at the University of Bristol, spent almost two years risking her life to provide medical supplies and emergency care to injured Ukrainian and foreign fighters, travelling to the most volatile stretches of the frontline and earning herself the nickname “Apache”. She died in the early hours of Christmas Eve in eastern Ukraine, her family said on Friday. Ms Mielniczuk was an “inspiration in resilience and grace” and the “kindest and most selfless person one could hope to meet”, her family said. An online fundraiser has so far garnered almost £3,000 of £10,000 to repatriate Ms Mielniczuk, also known as Kasia, to the UK. Her family said: “It is impossible to truly convey what an incredible woman Katherine was or how deeply and widely she was loved and will be missed. “Kasia is gone, but the endless warmth, love and grace she brought to the world will never be lost”. She wrote: “The mental, physical, financial consequences of war are catastrophic and a kind word can hold tremendous power for us when we are losing hope and seeing tragedies daily. “We prioritise fighting for a free Ukraine, for a prosperous and fruitful future for Ukrainian children.” To support repatriation and funeral costs for Ms Mielniczuk, visit: https://donorbox.org/katherine-mielniczuk",
