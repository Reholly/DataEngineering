    "text": "Syria's air defense units repel Israeli aggression near Damascus\nIran Press TV\nFriday, 29 December 2023 6:13 AM\nSyrian air defenses have intercepted most Israeli missiles near the country's capital city of Damascus, amid an upsurge in the regime's acts of aggression against the Arab nation following the bloody onslaught against Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip.\n\"At around 11:55 p.m. local time (2055 GMT) on Thursday, the Israeli enemy carried out an aerial attack from the direction of the occupied Golan Heights, and targeted a number of sites in the southern flank of Damascus,\" the official Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) quoted an unnamed military source as saying.\nThe source added that Syrian air defenses shot down most of the missiles.\nThe report noted that there were no injuries in the strike, but there were material losses.\nThe strike comes a day after Damascus International Airport reopened following repeated Israeli strikes.\nIsrael waged the bloody war on Gaza on October 7 after the Palestinian Hamas resistance movement launched Operation al-Aqsa Storm in the occupied territories in retaliation for the Tel Aviv regime's incessant crimes against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.\nSince the start of the aggression, the Tel Aviv regime has killed 21,320 Palestinians, most of them women and children, and injured more than 55,600 others.\nIt has also imposed a \"complete siege\" on the coastal sliver, cutting off fuel, electricity, food and water to the more than two million Palestinians living there.\nIsrael frequently targets military positions inside Syria, especially those of the Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah which has played a key role in helping the Syrian army in its fight against foreign-backed terrorists.\nThe Tel Aviv regime rarely comments on its attacks on Syrian territories, which many see as a knee-jerk reaction to the Syrian government's success in confronting and decimating terrorism.\nIsrael has been one of the main supporters of terrorist groups that oppose the democratically-elected government of President Bashar al-Assad since the foreign-backed militancy erupted in Syria.\n|\nNEWSLETTER\n|Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list\n|\n|",
