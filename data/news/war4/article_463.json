    "text": "United National Party’s (UNP’s) Colombo District Manager and Working Committee Member Lasantha Gunawardena said that every time the country collapsed, the UNP had had taken on the responsibility to save it and this time President Ranil Wickremesinghe would save the bankrupt country. Gunawardena said this while joining the press conference held on Wednesday (28) at Sirikotha, the UNP headquarters. He further expressed the following views: “When President Ranil Wickremesinghe took over the country in 2022, there was no money in the Treasury. There were long queues for petroleum and gas. Examinations could not be conducted. The farmers were destitute and they could not find a bundle of fertilizer even for Rs. 30,000. The dollar shot up to Rs. 400. Migrant workers did not send money to the country. No tourists came. The power cuts increased to 14 hours. It was a time when we had no way to pay for the oil tanker that anchored at the port. “Today, the Central Bank’s dollar reserves have been increased to US$ 4 billion. Today there are no gas queues, no oil queues. Schools are functioning on time and exams are being held. Children get more benefits including the Suraksha health insurance. Rs.113 billion was allocated from the Budget to increase salaries and pensions. Government employees’ allowances have been increased by Rs. 10,000. Also, the dollar, which was said to rise to Rs. 500, has been contained at Rs. 335 upper ceiling. “A sum of Rs. 207 billion was allocated for Aswesuma welfare benefits. A programme to grant land rights to people will begin in January. People get more value for their land accordingly. Urban residents are given ownership of their homes. It should be remembered that if the children had received tab computers, it would have been of great assistance during the Covid pandemic. “As a leader who thinks about the future, it should be noted that President Wickremesinghe’s allocation of money from this Budget for Artificial Intelligence is very important. Also, the bank interest which was 28 percent has been brought down to 12 percent. Through the Central Bank Act, a system has been created where money printing is limited. Inflation which was at 70 percent has been brought down to 3 percent.”",
