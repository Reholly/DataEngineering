    "text": "Ahmed Moamar\nOn Saturday, the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) appreciated the submission by the State of South Africa of a request to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to initiate measures against Israel for what it described as “acts of genocide against the Palestinian people” in the Gaza Strip.\nThe Palestinian movement said in a statement, “We highly appreciate South Africa’s submission of a request to the International Court of Justice to begin investigation procedures with the criminal occupation entity regarding its commission of the crime of genocide against our Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip.”\nThe movement's statement added, \"South Africa's move is an important step to hold accountable the leaders of the entity, the criminals of the era, who committed the most horrific massacres known to humanity in our contemporary history.\"\nHamas called on \"all countries to submit similar files and requests before the competent criminal courts, national and international, against this Nazi entity, as it is a threat to international peace and security, and to ensure that it does not escape punishment for the brutal crimes it committed against children and defenseless civilians in the Gaza Strip.\"\nThe International Court of Justice announced on Friday that South Africa had submitted a request to initiate proceedings against Israel for what it described as “acts of genocide against the Palestinian people” in the Gaza Strip.",
