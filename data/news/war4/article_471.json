    "text": "Luke Littler and Raymond van Barneveld will clash in the last 16 of the World Darts Championship on Saturday.\nForty years separate 16-year-old Littler, the youngest player to reach this stage of the tournament, and the 56-year-old five-time world champion.\nHere the PA news agency underlines the vast differences between the duo as they go head to head for a place in the quarter-finals at Alexandra Palace.\nExperience Raymond van Barneveld won his five world titles before Luke Littler was born (PA Archive) Van Barneveld won his fifth and most recent world title in on New Year’s Day in 2007, 21 days before Littler was born.\nThe Dutchman has also won a number of major ranking crowns in both the PDC and BDO organisations.\nLittler won his first senior event at the 2021 Irish Open at the age of 14.\nHe won the World Youth Championship in Minehead last month, averaging 102.16 in the final, to qualify for Ally Pally.\nSkill Luke Littler was on fire in his first round win over Christian Kist (Zac Goodwin/PA) As of Friday afternoon, Littler was one of only 10 players to average over 100 in a single match in this year’s tournament so far. His statistics of 106.12 in his first round win over Christian Kist ranking second only behind Stephen Bunting’s 107.28 against Ryan Joyce.\nLittler also averaged over 90 in his subsequent victories over Andrew Gilding and Matt Campbell, and has lost just two sets in the tournament so far.\nVan Barneveld averaged almost 100 in his first win over Radek Szaganski, but less than 90 in his win over Jim Williams.\nFuel Luke Littler’s run to the last 16 has been fuelled by a diet of kebabs and Fanta (Steven Paston/PA) Littler’s penchant for kebabs has provided plenty of food for thought with one London takeaway promising him free meals for life if he wins the world title, while an establishment in his hometown of Warrington is advertising Littler’s ‘favourite kebab’ on its menu.\nVan Barneveld is less likely to opt for the takeaway option. His 2022 campaign almost came unstuck after a bout of food poisoning brought on by a dodgy Chinese.\nInstead, the Dutchman said he expected to celebrate Christmas with a “gourmet dinner” after his opening win.\nWhat they say Raymond van Barneveld is relishing his showdown with Luke Littler (Zac Goodwin/PA) There is no disguising the age discrepancy between the pair as they prepare for one of the most eagerly awaited darts clashes of recent times.\n“It would be unbelievable to play Raymond,” said Littler. “I used to imitate him all the time – stood in my nappy, celebrating like Barney.”\nVan Barneveld responded: “The guy is amazing. When I was 16 I was playing with Lego and Playmobile, we didn’t have the internet or whatever.”\nSport",
