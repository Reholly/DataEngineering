    "text": "News\nFirst Minister calls for peace in Ukraine and Palestine in his final New Year Message\nMark Drakeford has repeated calls for an end to violence in Ukraine and the Middle East in his final message as First Minister.\nMr Drakeford, who recently announced his intention to step down as the leader of Welsh Labour and First minister next spring, said: “Blwyddyn Newydd Dda. Happy new year to you all. I hope you had a merry and peaceful Christmas.\n“As another year draws to a close and we get ready to welcome 2024, our thoughts naturally turn to the future.\n“It is a time for making plans for the year ahead. For making new resolutions. And for thinking about changes to come.”\nRemaining focused\nHe added: “This will be the last new year’s message I make as your First Minister, as this year will signal a change for me personally.\n“But until that time comes, I will be focused on this job – delivering on the promises I made to you.\n“As the new year dawns, we hope for an end to the terrible conflicts and violence which have dominated this year and last, especially in Ukraine.”\nLasting peace\n“The fighting must stop in the Middle East. We have to redouble our efforts to find a pathway to a lasting peace, which is fair to both Palestinians and Israelis.\n“The new year is a new start and I’m sure we all have ambitions and hopes for the year ahead.\n“Let’s hope for a peaceful 2024 and brighter and happier times ahead.”\nSupport our Nation today\nFor the price of a cup of coffee a month you can help us create an independent, not-for-profit, national news service for the people of Wales, by the people of Wales.",
