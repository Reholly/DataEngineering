    "text": "Hundreds of people marched in Nicosia on Saturday in support of Palestine, calling for a ceasefire as Israel continued to bomb Gaza.\nThe march started in Eleftheria Square and continued through the old town.\nPeople shouted: “Gaza, Gaza don’t you cry, we will never let you die.”\nMeanwhile protesters made speeches at the rally calling for a ceasefire, and an end to Israel’s impunity and occupation.\nThe United for Palestine – Cyprus movement organised the event.\nOn social media the movement linked a website for the boycott, divestment, sanction movement.\n“Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) is a Palestinian-led movement for freedom, justice and equality. BDS upholds the simple principle that Palestinians are entitled to the same rights as the rest of humanity.”\nBDS said : “Israel is occupying and colonising Palestinian land, discriminating against Palestinian citizens of Israel and denying Palestinian refugees the right to return to their homes. Inspired by the South African anti-apartheid movement, the BDS call urges action to pressure Israel to comply with international law.”\nCyprus Mailon Google News",
