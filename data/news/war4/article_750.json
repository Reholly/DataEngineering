    "text": "The Muslim Council of Britain welcomes South Africa’s referral of Israel to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for genocidal intent related to the atrocities in Gaza. This is an important reflection of the situation in Gaza and indiscriminate violence by Israeli forces. The ongoing bombing and killings in Palestine has resulted in immense suffering for innocent civilians with over 21,500 Palestinians killed and near 2 million displaced, by the Israeli state. In the last week alone, there has been attacks on the Christian communities, refugee camps and UN aid convoy, with countless members of the press also being killed. Settler violence has remained rampant, involving the illegal and forcible taking of Palestinian land and homes, resulting in the recent killings of over 300 Palestinians in the West Bank. MCB Secretary General, Zara Mohammed said: “South Africa’s referral to the International Court of Justice is a powerful statement from a nation familiar with the lived reality of apartheid. The South African state outline a strong case for genocidal intent by the actions and omissions of the Israeli Government, showing these are violations of the convention. While this is an important step towards justice, the violence must now cease.” In light of the recent [UN Resolution. 2720,](https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/12/1145022) which demands immediate, safe, and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance at scale directly to the Palestinian civilian population throughout the Gaza Strip, our government must do more to ensure civilians are not only receiving aid but working to end the violence permanently. As we approach the new year, sadly many will continue to suffer as a result of this siege and wars across the world. We urge our government to play its part in creating a lasting peace for this new year, upholding its moral duty to those afflicted by this unnecessary bloodshed. We need a permanent ceasefire now.” [ENDS] [MCB Updates](https://mcb.org.uk/category/mcb-updates/), [Press Releases](https://mcb.org.uk/category/press-releases/)",
