Ferrexpo president Lucio Genovese plans to resume exports via this route and laid bare the “tremendously difficult situation” he has faced since Russia invaded Ukraine. This has “drastically reduced opportunities to ship significant volumes of products to the Middle East and Asia,” Genovese said. Ferrexpo produces iron ore pellets. But only half of its four pellet lines have been used due to reduced export capacity.
