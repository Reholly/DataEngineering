    "text": "In his first game against his former team, Joe Flacco showed the Jets what they’ve been missing all season.\nFlacco completed 19-of-29 passes for 309 yards, three touchdowns and one interception in the Browns (11-5) 37-20 route of the Jets (6-10). The win clinched the Browns’ second playoff appearance in four seasons (2020).\nBrowns tight end David Njoku got off to a fast start. He recorded four catches for 114 yards in just the first quarter. Njoku finished with six receptions for 134 yards.\nRunning back Jerome Ford recorded 121 all-purpose yards for the Browns and a touchdown reception.\nJets quarterback Trevor Siemian started for the second consecutive week in place of Zach Wilson (concussion). He finished 32-of-45 for 262 yards with one touchdown and one interception.\nBreece Hall had another big night for the Jets. After finishing with 191 all-purpose yards in the 30-28 Christmas Eve victory against the Commanders, Hall recorded 126 receiving and rushing yards combined and a touchdown.\n Flacco put on a masterclass against the Jets, with whom he spent the previous three seasons. He completed 16-of-22 passes for 296 yards and three touchdowns in the first half.\nFlacco’s only blemish was a pick-6 interception to Jermaine Johnson with 2:13 left in the second quarter. The 38-year-old immediately came back to throw a 50-yard touchdown to Jerome Ford.\nAfter Aaron Rodgers’ Achilles injury, the Jets declined to call Flacco despite people inside the building having a ton of admiration for the 16-year veteran. But the Jets ‘loss was the Browns’ gain.\nInstead, the Jets decided to start Wilson for 11 games, Tim Boyle for two, and Siemian for two, and the results have been mediocre at best. Gang Green entered Thursday’s game with the worst offense in the NFL.\n...continued swipe to next page « 1 2 » View full story\n©2023 New York Daily News. Visit at nydailynews.com. ",
