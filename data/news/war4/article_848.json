    "text": "Defence Minister: 4,000 soldiers enter Hungarian army in 2023 Interest in the military is strong and growing, the statement said, noting the success of online and offline media recruitment campaigns and school presentations in 2023. The army recruitment website was visited more than 500,000 times and recruiters received more than 42,000 calls, it said, adding that from August to mid-September alone 1,500 new soldiers joined the Hungarian army. The 4,000 new recruits include reservists, contract soldiers, and non-commissioned officers. Also, more than 200 young people began studying military courses at the National Public Service University’s faculty of military science and defence officer training. The “Iron Man” recruitment campaign is entering its second phase, and 149 people have already applied to train on PzH 2000 self-propelled howitzers, the minister said. Every soldier who proves to be fit for service and who applies for enlistment on Feb 12 in the artillery division of the 1st Armored Brigade will have a starting salary of a monthly 737,000 (EUR 1,920) before tax, the statement said.",
