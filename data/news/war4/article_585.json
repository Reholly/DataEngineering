    "text": "In a landmark development, the pro-talks faction of the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) inked a historic peace accord with the central and state governments, marking a significant stride towards ending decades of insurgency in Assam.\nKey Agreements\n-\nViolence Abandoned: The ULFA’s commitment to renounce violence and disband the organization was a pivotal aspect of the accord, fostering an atmosphere of peace.\n- Democratic Engagement: Embracing the democratic process, the ULFA pledged to participate in peaceful political activities within the framework of the law, promoting stability and unity.\n-\nCamp Evacuation: The accord includes ULFA’s agreement to vacate all camps occupied by its armed cadres, showcasing a tangible step towards normalcy and reconciliation.\nAmit Shah’s Optimism\nUnion Home Minister Amit Shah lauded the signing of the accord as “a golden day” for Assam, expressing optimism about the region’s future. The development is a result of over 12 years of unconditional negotiations with the Arabinda Rajkhowa-led faction.\nRemaining Challenges\nHowever, the hardline faction of ULFA, led by Paresh Baruah, remains outside the peace agreement. Baruah, reportedly residing along the China-Myanmar border, poses a continued challenge to achieving comprehensive peace in the region.\nQuestions Related to Exams\n- What was Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s reaction to the ULFA peace accord, and why did he refer to it as “a golden day” for Assam?\n- How does the exclusion of Paresh Baruah’s faction impact the potential for lasting peace and reconciliation in the region?\n- In the context of the ban, how does the recent peace accord represent a significant step towards stability in Assam?\nPlease Try to Answer in the Comment Section!!",
