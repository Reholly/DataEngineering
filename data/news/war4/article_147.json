    "text": "Australia won the Boxing Day Test on Friday Pat Cummins single-handedly skittled Pakistan But there was controversy around one dismissal\nPat Cummins’ second 10-wicket haul in Tests has powered Australia to a thrilling 79-run win over Pakistan at the MCG.\nThe Australia captain made all the crucial breakthroughs late on Friday as the hosts bowled Pakistan out for 237 to win the Boxing Day Test.\nPakistan fought bravely but lost 5-18 during a chaotic finish to day four as Australia took the extra 30 minutes after the scheduled stumps to complete the victory and retain the Benaud-Qadir trophy.\nCummins finished with match figures of 10-97 after taking 5-49 in the second innings.\nMohammad Rizwan and Salman Ali Agha threatened to push Pakistan towards a famous win and break a 28-year winless run in Tests in Australia.\nAustralia have defeated Pakistan to gain an unassailable lead in their three-match series\nPat Cummins took an incredible 10-wicket haul to win the Test at the MCG\nCummins ended the 67-run partnership between the pair in bizarre and dramatic fashion just 15 minutes before the scheduled close of play.\nAustralia reviewed a not out call to Rizwan as a Cummins delivery flew into Alex Carey’s gloves.\nBut after a long review from the third umpire, Richard Illingworth deemed the ball flicked Rizwan’s wrist band that was connected to his gloves.\nRizwan was the furious with the decision, with Pakistan 5-219 at the time and starting to believe they could pull off the country’s highest successful winning chase against Australia.\n‘I got a little bit twitchy there,’ Cummins said.\n‘I felt OK but they were batting nicely. Happy with the Rizwan wicket.’\nIt was Cummins who stood up earlier, claiming the crucial wicket of his opposing captain Shan Masood (60), before tea.\nCummins took his fourth of the second innings just minutes later, dismissing Aamir Jamal (0).\nThe wickets earned him the Jonny Mullagh Medal for player of the match, made him the 10th Australian to pass 250 Test scalps and capped a superb year as captain.\nAt seven wickets down, Australia opted to take the extra 30 minutes in a bid to complete the match on Friday instead of coming back for day five.\nBut Pakistan were left fuming over Mohammad Rizwan’s controversial dismissal\nPat Cummins’s role in the victory caps off a perfect year for the Australia captain\nIt was a rollicking end to one of the great MCG Tests, with Pakistan fighting harder than many touring nations usually do on Australian soil.\nEarlier in the day, Pakistan star Babar Azam looked about to explode after a difficult start to the series.\nBut on 41, the former skipper was bowled by another classic delivery – this time by Josh Hazlewood.\nBabar’s stumps were rattled in the first innings by Cummins, who produced a seaming ‘dream ball’, and Hazlewood’s wicket was just as good.\n‘The game kept turning. Sometimes it went Australia’s way, sometimes ours,’ Masood said.\n‘But when we were leading with bat when me and Abdullah had a good partnership (in the first innings), Pat Cummins came in with that spell.\n‘And that is why he is one of the best bowlers in the world.’",
