Today, we were his family and now, he is finally home,' State Rep. Steve Xiarhos wrote in a tribute [Zachary Rogers](/author/zachary-rogers) Dozens of strangers and one long-lost friend gathered Friday to honor a [Vietnam](https://themessenger.com/search?s=Vietnam) veteran who has passed away after battling terminal cancer alone. Army Veteran Charles “Charlie” Connolly, 78, was homeless and had no family at the time of his death on Dec. 18, according to Massachusetts State Rep.
