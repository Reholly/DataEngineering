    "text": "Alonet Zarum Zandan woke up to the sound of sirens Oct. 7. She and her husband were in Herzliya, Israel, visiting her mother and other relatives and friends for the stone-setting ceremony for her late father, a Yemeni Jew who died last year. At first, Zandan said, they didn't know what was happening. They don't normally watch TV on the Sabbath, but they turned it on \"and it was saying 'Stay indoors, stay in your property, lock the doors, stay away from windows,' ” she recalled. The group sat in a sheltered area of the house and could hear helicopters outside as the scale of the Hamas attack became clear. They stayed there for two days. The couple's flight home to Santa Fe had been canceled, but a friend was able to help them get a new flight from Tel Aviv to Tiblisi, Georgia. Zandan said they encountered crowds of people without tickets at Ben Gurion Airport in Israel; everyone was desperate to find a way out. \"It was a nightmare,\" she said. Twenty minutes after their flight took off, the airport came under attack. From Tiblisi, they flew to Munich, and then to Denver and finally to Santa Fe. \"During that time, I'm already planning, 'We have to do something,' ” Zandan said. She had been asked earlier about forming an umbrella organization to replace the Jewish Federation of New Mexico, which disbanded last year, but there didn't seem to be an impetus. \"This really galvanized people,\" she said. She joined up with a woman in Albuquerque to create the Jewish Community Relations Coalition of New Mexico, an all-volunteer organization with 26 partner Jewish organizations in the state. Zandan said the coalition's goal is to \"unite the Jewish community, inform, educate and advocate,\" in part to counter what she says are simplistic and biased narratives about the conflict. \"My family, they all want peace,\" she said. \"But as much as they want it, they know it can't happen until the terrorists are neutralized and don't have the ability to attack anyone anymore. Hamas needs to be gone.\" Many of Zandan's male relatives have been called up to active duty. \"Every day there's a list of soldiers that have been killed,\" she said. \"And I just pray that I don't see one of my family members up there.\" 'It's changed a lot of people's lives' Aaron Moskowitz doesn't come from a very religious family. But this year, his sister went out and bought a menorah for Hanukkah, which she had never lit before in her own home. A Jewish friend of his was planning a trip to Europe for the holidays. While they were there, she and her husband visited the site of the Dachau concentration camp. He thinks those are indications of a larger desire from the Jewish community to take stock of what it means to be Jewish following Hamas' Oct. 7 attack in Israel, and to be in community with others. \"It's made them want to do things that are more Jewish,\" Moskowitz said. He thinks the tragic events have brought Santa Fe's Jewish community closer together, which he finds heartening. He cited this year's Chanukah on the Plaza celebration, which he said was the best he had ever been to. \"It felt different from other years,\" he said. \"It was just really, really strong community vibes over there. And all sorts of people from outside the Jewish community had come and were saying, 'We're here to support you.' That was really moving.\" While the national rise in antisemitism is frightening, Moskowitz said it hasn't been significant locally. \"Most people here really want peace and are friendly towards each other,\" he said. The conflict has sparked a desire for community that he hasn't seen in recent years, he said, noting a group for younger Jewish people recently formed, and during Hanukkah \"there were parties happening every single night.\" \"I think that everybody during this time was reflecting on what it means to be Jewish,\" he said. \"In many ways that meant being together because that's a big part of being Jewish, doing things together.\" 'We can imagine something better' Vic Wiener was born and raised in Santa Fe but spent seven months living in Israel as a child in 1999 and 2000. Wiener was just 10 at the time and \"wasn't super politically aware.\" But it was clear something was \"profoundly wrong\" when an Orthodox Jewish student got into a fight with the only Palestinian student in the class so violent one of them could have been killed, said Wiener, who uses they/them pronouns. \"It affected me really deeply,\" Wiener said of the experience. As they grew up and learned more about the region, their sense of injustice continued to grow. It culminated in Wiener leaving the synagogue where they became a bat mitzvah after an experience during a workshop at a conference for Jewish teenagers, where they expressed support for Palestinians having access to their land. \"That night, students were refusing to hold my hand at the closing circle,\" Wiener remembered. \"People stopped talking to me. I had no idea what I was walking into.\" Wiener it's difficult to be part of a mainstream Jewish organization and also be critical of Israel's politics, a situation that has only intensified following the outbreak of Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza. Wiener comes from an Ashkenazi Jewish family who fled Eastern Europe and grew up learning about the horrors of the Holocaust. What's happening now in Gaza, \"I don't know words for it beyond genocide,\" they said. That view, and their involvement in protests calling for a cease-fire, has cost them. \"I've had family reach out to me telling me that I'm calling for a second Holocaust, or that I should stand with my own,\" Wiener said. \"I've lost contact with a lot of my family now because of my views on Palestine.\" Friends have shared similar experiences, with some not going home for Hanukkah because of conflict with family members, they said. Wiener thinks the Oct. 7 attack was traumatic for many in the Jewish community because of the generations of violence toward Jewish people, but they don't think the response from Israel is justified. \"I refuse to believe that my safety requires the killing of tens of thousands of people,\" Wiener said. \"That's not safety for me. That's not safety for anyone.\" 'The fortress has been breached' Author and playwright Rosemary Zibart grew up in a nonobservant household. \"My father, the only thing he ever said about Israel was Jews were much more respected once Israel was created,\" she said. \"It's very meaningful that Israel was powerful, so their loss of power is something to deal with because it makes us vulnerable again.\" That sense of vulnerability following the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas is something Zibart doesn't think people outside the Jewish community fully understand. \"Israel was a stronghold, and now it's not,\" she said. \"The fortress has been breached. And that has been a real blow, even to people very far on the left.\" Zibart said younger Jews have grown up with the perception of Israel as an all-powerful behemoth, which wasn't the case for her generation. \"We don't just know it as an imperial power, we know it as a refuge,\" she said. She thinks the current Israeli government has strayed from the ideals the nation was founded on, and she is disturbed by the number of innocent Palestinians killed in the conflict. \"I was raised believing Judaism was a peace-loving religion, and the Israeli response to the attack is the opposite of peaceful,\" she said. \"If Israel loses its traditional values, it will be eroded from within.\" At the same time, she's troubled by what she feels is a double standard in criticism of the nation. In a written piece, she noted New Mexicans are living on land taken first from Native Americans and then from Hispanics. \"It's just that Israel is late to the game — the era of Manifest Destiny has passed,\" she wrote. \"But I can't help but feel some of the indignation about Israel stems from some of the guilt we have about our pasts that we're doing nothing or very little to heal.\" In the early 2000s Zibart belonged to a group called Tikkun that advocated for a two-state solution, but after several years the group dissolved because the members didn't feel they were making a difference. She wonders if now would be a better time to lobby, but change feels so far away. \"It's very difficult to imagine any positive outcome, and that's what's so tragic,\" she said. ‘People treat us like nothing’ Samar Awad, from a small village in the West Bank called Deir Dibwan, arrived in the U.S. at age 15 and soon moved to New Mexico. Awad now lives in Santa Fe with her four children, all in middle school and high school. The Israeli military and settlers have long oppressed Palestinians in the West Bank, but violence against Palestinians has increased since Oct. 7, Awad said. “I’m Palestinian American, but my home is Palestine and I’m hoping one day I could go back and live there with my kids,” she said. “But I’m afraid that’s not going to happen because it’s getting worse every day.\" She added, \"My parents, they’re afraid to go outside. I’m scared I’m not going to have a home to take my kids to.\" Even in her village, the Israeli military has been breaking into houses; a few blocks from her parents’ house, the military beat a 20-year-old Palestinian man to death in front of her cousins, she said. “The thing that hurts me the most is that people treat us like nothing,” Awad said. “That’s how we’ve been treated in Palestine for the last 75 years. … [The Israeli military] have the green light to do whatever they want, [and confront] citizens even walking around the village or even standing in front of their home. Every week, even outside Gaza … there are people being killed. “It’s been going on for decades, it’s not since Oct. 7,” she said. Awad does not condone violence, she said, but she views Hamas’ attack as an attempt to force Israel to release hundreds of Palestinians she said are being held “hostage” in jail. “They were just fighting for our people,” Awad said. “[Israel] doesn’t allow us to live in our land. \"We are fine to share, just let us enjoy our country,\" she said. \"Let us go from [one] village to another. Let us go to the grocery store without stopping us, without questioning us, without pointing a gun on our head. Our kids are not safe to go anywhere there by themselves.” Awad has been attending cease-fire protests in Santa Fe and wishes people would show more support for Palestinians and push for action from the U.S. government. “There’s a lot of people fighting for my people, my country, but there's a lot of people here, they don't even care,” she said. “When I talk to them, they seem to be like, in denial; they don't want to believe what I'm saying. They don't want to understand what I'm saying.” 'Grieving every single day' Samayya Cabré, who spent her childhood in Spain and Sweden, moved to Abiquiú with her parents as a teenager, where the family joined the Dar al Islam community. Cabré now lives in Santa Fe with her 15-year-old son, whose father is from Gaza. Cabré and her son have spent the past two months “grieving every single day,” she said. “Last time we had the strength to look, my son had lost 10 members of his family, all women and children,” she said. “We haven’t looked in a few weeks.” Those deaths include her son’s cousin Hiba Abu Nada, a poet killed by an Israeli airstrike on her home Oct. 20. A video of her son’s uncle, Palestinian doctor Abdullah Abu Nada, also went viral in October, when Abu Nada learned his wife and three children from ages 12 to 16 were killed by an Israeli airstrike after he had been working in the hospital for three days straight, Cabré said. “Some days we wonder, is [the footage] even having an effect?” she said. Cabré has seen more and more people, especially young people, wanting to know more about the conflict, “so that brings hope,” she said. Cabré and her family members have been attending cease-fire protests in Santa Fe, though “some days it’s too heavy” for her son, she said. “[We’re in] incredible disbelief that this is allowed to happen and that the powers that can stop it are not stopping it, but are actually supporting financially and with weapons,” she said. She wants politicians in New Mexico to speak out against the violence. “It’s enraging that it’s being called a war between Hamas and Israel when the people that are being murdered are innocent Palestinians and thousands of children who had nothing to do with Hamas,” she said. “I mean, in this modern era, if [Israel] wanted to target something, they can,” Cabré said. “If this was self-defense … they wouldn’t be killing children. They wouldn’t be killing reporters [who] are telling the truth about what’s happening there.” More than 60 Palestinian journalists have been confirmed dead, according to the nonprofit Committee to Protect Journalists. 'You end the occupation, you end Hamas’ Kenneth Mayers, a secular Jew, has long been a member of Veterans for Peace and founded the Santa Fe chapter in 2002 shortly after he moved to the city. Mayers became interested in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in graduate school, when a Palestinian member of his baby-sitting group told Mayers about his family’s displacement from Jerusalem after World War II. Learning more completely changed Mayers' understanding of Israel’s founding, where settlements were built \"on the ruins of Palestinian villages,\" he said. He became an activist for Palestinians' rights when Israel launched Operation Cast Lead in December 2008, which killed about 1,400 Palestinians in Gaza. In the following years, he participated in international marches for peace in Gaza, visited the West Bank three times and also connected with four cousins living in Israel. Mayers has spent the past several weeks speaking about his story and attending local cease-fire demonstrations. On Oct. 7, two relatives of his cousins were taken hostage by Hamas and have not been heard from since. Meanwhile, in the West Bank, three close friends who were Palestinian activists — all with family members killed by Israelis — were “immediately” arrested by the Israeli government, he said. “I think whether you have ‘skin in the game’ or not,” he said, referring to his connections to the region, “if you've got any humanity, you can't help but be horrified and pained by what's being inflicted on the Palestinian people.\" He added, “When people say, ‘Well, we've got to root out Hamas,’ you can only root out Hamas by resolving the underlying issues which give birth to Hamas and sustain it, and that's the occupation. You end the occupation, you end Hamas.” The long-term solution to the violence is creating one democratic nation, equal for all, with religious freedom, Mayers said. That's because \"even those Israelis who favor a two-state solution don’t favor two equal states.\" ‘It’s Palestinians against injustice’ Growing up in Egypt, Zeinab Benhalim routinely saw her mother’s sadness about having been displaced from her home. She left during the Nakba, the mass displacement of Palestinians during the founding of Israel, Benhalim said. “It’s like, the whole trauma is repeating itself again,” she said. Benhalim has lived in Santa Fe for over 30 years and owns Tribes Coffee House. Although she does not know anyone still living in Palestinian territories, the violence in Gaza has affected her daily. “I can’t really function properly because I can’t get [the images] out of my mind, thinking, how is the world accepting this over 75 years?” she said. \"What’s happening in Gaza is … totally inhumane,” she said, adding she “absolutely” supports a cease-fire. “And you know, it’s racism. For me, it’s pure evil. I can’t find the right word to say it, really.” Benhalim has wrestled with thoughts about why Hamas launched the Oct. 7 attack on Israel, knowing the response would be “horrible,” but also described Hamas as backed “against the wall.” “Every single day of Palestinian life is hell, anyway,” she said, adding Palestinians are treated as second-class citizens and routinely intimidated, arrested and abused by the Israeli military. “Do you think that’s the kind of life that you would accept for yourself?” she said. “This is not going to pass. Things have to change … and it doesn’t mean it’s Palestinians against Jews — it’s Palestinians against injustice,\" she said. The U.S. should put aside its economic interests and put “world peace first,” Benhalim continued, saying the U.S. has been destabilizing, rather than stabilizing, the Middle East. “As a nation, as a world, we could do better.”",
