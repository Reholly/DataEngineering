    "text": "2024 calendar supporting Ukraine kids affected by nuclear disaster, war available in Japan (Mainichi Japan) KYOTO -- A 2024 calendar featuring photos of the people affected by the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster has been completed by a citizens' group in Japan. The Chernobyl Children's Fund, Japan, based in Tokyo's Nerima Ward, created the calendar with the hope of conveying the reality of children who are trying to thrive amid aftereffects of the nuclear meltdown and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The group has long supported Ukraine's nuclear disaster victims. The area affected by the Chernobyl disaster has seen residents develop brain tumors, thyroid disease and other illnesses transcending generations. Since 1996, the Chernobyl Children's Fund has held recreational retreats jointly with a local nongovernmental organization every year. They invite disaster victims and others to a resort facility during summer vacation and holiday periods to receive health checkups, treatment and counseling in a place where they don't have to worry about radiation contamination. Due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the retreat was canceled for the first time in 2022. While the groups were able to hold it this year, the coastal village that had usually hosted the event in southern Ukraine's Kherson Oblast had become a fierce battleground, and the location had to be moved to a facility in the Carpathian Mountains in the country's west. In total, three retreat sessions were held this year with some 90 participants, mainly children. One of this year's participants, 16-year-old Anastasija Prokopenko, had her hometown come under aggressive fire by the Russian military. Prokopenko said, \"I still get goosebumps remembering the time a missile flew over my house and a bomb fell nearby. I'm thankful for this opportunity to forget about the horrific events even for a moment.\" Chernobyl Children's Fund secretary-general Mari Sasaki said, \"We hope many people realize the reality that not just the war, but damage from the nuclear accident continues to affect people.\" The calendar features photos capturing the damage from the war and nuclear catastrophe, as well as children smiling at the retreats. The calendars, A4 size when opened, are 900 yen (about $6.30) per copy, plus 200 yen (approx. $1.40) for shipping. Proceeds go to the cost of holding the retreats and medical supplies. For more information, the group can be contacted by email at cherno1986@jcom.zaq.ne.jp or by phone at 03-6767-8808. (Japanese original by Norikazu Chiba, Kyoto Bureau)",
