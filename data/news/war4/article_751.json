From being deployed on the world’s highest battlefield to indigenous building warships and aircraft, women commanding combat units and naval warships, 2023 had established new dynamics.\nFrom buyers to builders\nINS Imphal |\nDecember 26 was one of the remarkable days for the Indian Armed Forces with INS Imphal, a Project 15B stealth guide missile destroyer was commissioned by the Indian Navy at Naval Dockyard, Mumbai. One of the four indigenous Visakhapatnam class destroyers is being designed by the Indian Navy’s Warship Design Bureau and constructed by Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL), Mumbai. The ship measures 163m in length, and 17m in breadth with a displacement of 7,400 tonnes and is amongst the most potent warships built in India.\nFrom being 'Buyers Navy' to 'Builders Navy', the force has come a long way since its establishment in 1950. With aircraft carriers, destroyers, stealth frigates, corvettes, submarines and other war vessels being constructed in India, presently, of the 66 ships under construction 64 are being built in India. Further, the plan includes 24 ships and submarines constructed in Indian shipyards to make the Indian Navy aatmanirbhar by 2047.\nIn 2023, five shipbuilding contracts at a total value of Rs 41,742.37 crore were concluded with Indian shipyards.
