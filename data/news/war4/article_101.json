(Nasdaq: MDWD), a fully-integrated biopharmaceutical company focused on next-generation enzymatic therapeutics for tissue repair, today announced that the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), through the Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium (MTEC), has awarded MediWound an additional $6.7 million in non-dilutive funding to develop NexoBrid® as a non-surgical solution for field-care burn treatment for the U.S. Army (the \"MTEC Research Project Award\"). The $14.4 million project budget will advance the development and production of a new, temperature-stable formulation of NexoBrid, positioning it as the first-line non-surgical solution for treating severe burn injuries in pre-hospital settings. Vericel Corporation holds an exclusive license encompassing the commercial and development rights to NexoBrid in North America as set forth in the license agreement between the Company and Vericel.\n\"We are delighted to further solidify our partnership with the U.S. Department of Defense. The additional funding will enhance our CMC activities, expedite preclinical development, and facilitate the establishment of a GMP compliant aseptic production line for the temperature-stable formulation of NexoBrid,\" announced Ofer Gonen, Chief Executive Officer of MediWound. \"This new award underscores our shared commitment to ensuring NexoBrid's availability for military use and its potential to significantly change the early treatment approach for severe burns.\"\nThe MTEC Research Project Award was granted by the DoD’s U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command (USAMRDC) and funded by the Defense Health Agency through MTEC, a biomedical technology consortium working to advance innovative medical solutions to keep military personnel healthy and fully operational. In alignment with this mission, it's vital to have field solutions for severe burn treatments that are both easy-to-use and effective. Such solutions should be applicable immediately post-injury and demand minimal preparation and training.\nAbout U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command (USAMRDC)\nThe U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command is the Army’s medical materiel developer, with responsibility for medical research, development, and acquisition. USAMRDC produces medical solutions for the battlefield with a focus on various areas of biomedical research, including military infectious diseases, combat casualty care, military operational medicine, medical chemical, and biological defense\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=4u1_1Ji9Igmto5nLISSwcNb0-ga6PzG7wubj2apkcYFFinByPchVO-rC_11M_vpiM83zBhd5p2kLOHdQcJtVhrMle4xWTccwZJaXXal8ahM=.\nPlease note, the views expressed in this press release are those of MediWound and may not reflect the official policy or position of the Department of the Army, Department of Defense, or the U.S. Government.\nAbout\nMedical Technology Enterprise Consortium (MTEC)\nThe Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium is a biomedical technology consortium collaborating with multiple government agencies under a 10-year renewable Other Transaction Agreement with the U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command.
