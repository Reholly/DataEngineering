    "text": "It is the responsibility of every Indian to take care of the families of soldiers killed in action, said Defence Minister Rajnath Singh in Surat Saturday. He also felicitated and handed over Shaurya Rashi of Rs 2.50 lakh to family of each of 58 martyr soldiers in an event organised by Maruti Veer Jawan Trust, run by diamond businessmen of Surat on Saturday.\n“When a gardener sows a plant, he does not think if he would be there in the future to see its flowers. Similarly, a soldier does not think whether he would be there to see a developed India or not,” he said.\nRajnath, whose mother’s name is Gujarati Devi, said, “I love Gujarat and I have visited Gujarat many times even when I was the national president of the\nBJP. I have emotional sentiments attached to Gujarat.”\nHe highlighted that the members of Maruti Veer Jawan Trust come from a diamond business background. “The diamonds that are cut and polished in\nSurat are found everywhere in the world. I feel proud of it,” he said.\nThe event was the fifth held by Maruti Veer Jawan Trust to felicitate families of slain soldiers and hand them Shaurya Rashi. Till date, the trust has given Shaurya Rashi to families of 325 soldiers.",
