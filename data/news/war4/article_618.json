    "text": "\"WAR IS GONE!\" Billboard Urges Action NEW YORK, NY, December 30, 2023 /24-7PressRelease/ -- In a powerful action against wars of all kinds, esteemed John Lennon actor Lenn Johnston unveils his latest Peace initiative in Times Square, in revival of Lennon's 1970 Peace Campaign. This weekend, Lenn shares Peace Cards to be waved by the people in the crowd on New Year's Eve for their billion-or-so viewers. Many around the world might participate in Peace efforts, if encouraged by those gathered live. Every 15 minutes, the Peace Billboard appears; and those with Peace Cards can then wave them overhead. Lenn provides these free cards in front of the Hard Rock Cafe, near 43rd & Broadway, and encourages everyone to work for Peace in 2024. Lenn's iconic Billboard, proclaiming \" [WAR IS GONE! â€“ If you halt it](http://JohnLennonReturns.com),\" stands as a beacon in turbulent times, advocating the end to the many forms of large-scale violence plaguing our world. Inspired by John Lennon's vision, this Peace Billboard campaign aims to ignite a collective consciousness towards harmony and freedom from aggression. To those at home, Lenn offers replicas of the Billboard as [11\"x17\" posters](https://johnlennonreturns.com/store/). These scaled versions allow people to renounce war and announce the message of peace from their front windows, workplaces and schools, just as John Lennon had done, as a reminder of the urgent need to halt all acts of war against Life on Earth. Celebrated for his striking resemblance to, and voice and embodiment of, the late music icon, Lenn Johnston promotes Peace on Earth and honors John Lennon's historic Peace campaign.
