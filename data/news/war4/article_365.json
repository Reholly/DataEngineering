In order to spread the message, viewpoint, ideology and direction of the defense minister, as well as supplement learning and research materials for officers and soldiers in the whole military about the Party's military and defense guidelines, the requirements and tasks of building an elite, compact, strong and modernized military in the new situation, the People’s Army Publishing House and the Department of Political Education and Information have published the book \"Promoting glorious traditions and building an elite, compact, strong and modernized Vietnam People's Army in the new situation\".
