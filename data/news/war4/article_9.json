    "text": "Name: Joe Massei and Carlos Carbajal\nService branch: Marine Corps\nThe December 2023 Humboldt Hero is Joe Massei, and he is sharing the spotlight with his fallen comrade in arms, Carlos Carbajal.\nAnthony Joseph Massei III was born on Sept. 10, 1948, at St. Joseph Hospital in Eureka. “Joe” was raised in Eureka and graduated from St. Bernard’s Catholic School. He attended the College of the Redwoods for a semester and played football there.\nMassei enlisted in the Marine Corps on Nov. 1, 1968, because he wanted to serve his country. Basic training was at the Marine Corps recruit depot in San Diego. As a private, he went to infantry training at Camp Pendelton and advanced to private 1st class. On deployment to Vietnam, he advanced to lance corporal and then corporal ranking. He was a 0311 infantry rifleman.\nJoe served in Da Nang, Hue, Khe Sanh, Con Tien, Dong Ha, Quang Tri, and on the border of the demilitarized zone. During his service, Massei received a Purple Heart and numerous other awards.\nJoe Massei’s brother Mike joined the Marine Corps about a year after he did. One time when Joe was at the Da Nang airport while on “R&R” in Vietnam, a person came up behind him, tapped him on the shoulder and said, “Joe, is that you?” It was his brother, Mike! The scheduled flights for both Joe and Mike were delayed about three hours, giving them precious and unexpected time to visit.\nAnother surprise the brothers received while in Vietnam was news their parents were expecting another child. Their baby sister Anna Marie was born while they were both still deployed.\nAfter discharge, Massei began working at McGaraghan’s department store and met his mentor and lifelong friend Frank McGaraghan. Massei purchased a men’s wear store from McGarahan, owned a liquor display business, worked as a bodyguard, and completed his work life with Massei Logging.\nMassei has been a member of the Here and Now group at the Eureka Veteran’s Center since 1987. He is a founding member of the Boys and Girls Club in Eureka, and is active in the DAV, VFW, Henderson Center Kiwanas, Sons of Italy, and Eureka Elks Club. He has been on the St. Bernard’s Crusader Athletic Board for more than 25 years and is also a Grand Knight for the Knights of Columbus Council 3103.\nFriday’s recognition is also about a young Marine from San Diego named Carlos Carbajal. He served alongside Massei on the border of the DMZ in Vietnam. They were going to do mine sweeps between Dong Ha and Con Tien one morning in 1969 when Carbajal received word through the Red Cross that he had just become the father of a baby girl. Carbajal was overjoyed and asked Joe to take a picture of him to send home to his family. Two hours later, Carbajal was killed while standing five feet away from Massei.\nWhen Joe returned home, he tried for more than 50 years and in many ways to contact Carbajal’s family, through investigators, police, public records, and messages on social media. He wanted Carbajal’s daughter, wife, and family to know the great joy it brought Carlos to know he was a father of a baby girl.\nOn Memorial Day this year, the Massei family received an email from Carbajal’s niece, who had found a message that Joe’s wife Mary had posted on a veterans’ website a year earlier. She let them know that Carbajal’s daughter Carla was doing well and lives in Chula Vista with her mother. Massei was able to share the photo with his family.\nCarla grew up very loved and is the oldest of 30 cousins. She has three children of her own and recently became a grandmother. Carbajal has 10 siblings, all still alive, and most of whom live in the San Diego area. Carbajal’s name is on a memorial wall in one of the San Diego parks, and he is interred at Fort Rosencrans there with a beautiful view of the ocean.\nThe extremely close-knit extended family still gets together annually in Carbajal’s childhood home, and in May 2024, Joe Massei and his wife Mary are planning to make a trip there to visit with Carla, her mother, and all of the large and loving family.\nIf you go\nWhat: Monthly Humboldt Heroes celebration.\nWhen: Noon today\nWhere: 537 7th St., Eureka\nNominate a “Humboldt Hero”: “Humboldt Heroes” normally honors local veterans on the last Friday of the month.
