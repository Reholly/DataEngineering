    "text": "Jarrett Stidham’s heroics as the Auburn starting quarterback in 2017 plays through Chip Lindsey’s mind as if it happened yesterday.\nIn three weeks, Lindsey — Auburn’s former offensive coordinator — watched Stidham perform what could be considered the unthinkable. First, he threw for three touchdowns in a 40-17 drubbing of top-ranked Georgia.\nTwo weeks later, with Alabama then No. 1 in the country, Stidham rushed 16 yards for a touchdown to solidify the Tigers’ 26-14 upset over the Crimson Tide in the Iron Bowl.\n“He pulled a run on a zone read and ran through a couple of tackles and willed us to a win,” Lindsey, now the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at North Carolina, told The Denver Post.\nNot too many college quarterbacks can say they beat Alabama and Georgia in the same season. When Stidham did so in his first season with the Tigers, it gave his coaches every indication he could be a starter in the NFL, and it offers hope that he could perform well as the Broncos’ new starting quarterback in place of Russell Wilson.\n“I think he’s got that special (ability) to perform at a high level in a situation like that,” former Auburn coach Gus Malzahn told The Post.\nEach win showcased a different ability from Stidham, who started two seasons with the Tigers. Against the Bulldogs, he showcased his toughness and willingness to stay in the pocket against pressured. While facing third down, Stidham watched two defenders close in before he tossed a screen pass to running back Kerryon Johnson for a 55-yard touchdown.\nStidham finished the game with 214 passing yards and a 69.6% completion percentage while rushing for a score.\nIn the win over the Crimson Tide, Stidham’s dual-threat ability was on display. He rushed for 51 yards on 12 carries while adding 237 yards in the air. What stood out to Lindsey the most was how Stidham handled himself on third down, as he helped the Tigers convert nine of their 18 attempts.\n“When you play those two teams, you gotta have a guy that (has) a lot of poise (under pressure). He did that,” Lindsey said.\nMalzahn, the current head coach at Central Florida, knew Stidham had the potential to be a special player. Coming out of Stephenville High School in Stephenville, Texas, Stidham was a five-star recruit and ranked the top dual-threat quarterback in the nation by 247sports.\nHe played one season at Baylor, totaling 1,265 yards and 12 touchdowns, and started three games as a true freshman in 2015. Stidham sat out in 2016 before transferring to Auburn. His physical attributes and ability to make every throw in the pocket fit with everything the Tigers were seeking in a starting quarterback.\n“You just knew he was going to be a real special player, and he had a skill set we were searching for. It was a real special match,” Malzahn said.\nKevin C. Cox, Getty Images Jarrett Stidham (8 )of the Auburn Tigers rushes the ball during the third quarter against the Alabama Crimson Tide at Jordan Hare Stadium on Nov. 25, 2017 in Auburn, Ala. For Malzahn and Lindsey, Stidham’s leadership ability stood out the moment he arrived at Auburn. He did a solid job carrying the coaches’ message to the players and wasn’t afraid to stand up and hold players accountable.\nLindsey said Stidham led in the right way and was never arrogant in his approach.\nRelated Articles Denver Broncos | WATCH: Jarrett Stidham finds Lil’Jordan Humphrey for electric 54-yard touchdown vs. Chargers Denver Broncos | How it happened: Jarrett Stidham, defense lead Broncos to Week 17 win over Chargers Denver Broncos | Kiszla: With good riddance to Mr. Let’s Ride, who can end Broncos’ long nightmare at quarterback?

Denver Broncos | NFL Picks: Ravens, Dolphins square off one week after impressive wins, plus the Browns are going to the postseason “For him to transfer into a program like Auburn and establish himself as the leader of the group, that’s hard to do,” Lindsey said. “These (recruiting) classes develop bonds. All of a sudden, here comes this quarterback and wins the job. I thought he assimilated into the team really well.”\nStidham, a fourth-round pick in 2019, has been a backup throughout his NFL career. When the Broncos signed Stidham in the offseason, head coach Sean Payton believed the former Patriots and Raiders signal-caller could be a starter.\nLindsey agrees as well. He said Stidham just needs the opportunity to prove it. Denver’s future at the quarterback position is unclear now that the franchise elected to bench Wilson in favor of Stidham. But the final two games might serve as an audition for Stidham to show that he can lead this team in the future.\n“There’s no doubt he can. He’s got the ability,” Malzahn said.\nWant more Broncos news?
