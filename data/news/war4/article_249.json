    "text": "New Delhi: Footballers who have \"strength of character\" will be picked for India's AFC Asian Cup squad, head Igor Stimac said on Friday, convinced that it is the key element needed to tackle the superior strength of Australia, Uzbekistan and Syria in the group stage. Stimac will name his final 26-man squad on Saturday and then travel to Dubai where the team is scheduled to have a preparatory camp from January 1 before moving to Qatar for the continental tournament. Their group stage engagements begin against Australia on January 13 but injuries to several key players have forced the coach to resort to contingency plans from the list of 50 preliminary probables he had named before. What we are looking for the final list of 26 is definitely experience, physical strength, and the final line will be drawn by the strength of their character,” Stimac said in a video posted by the All India Football Federation on its social media channels. The Croat said that all the boys he has chosen for the probable list are similar in their football qualities. Thus it is very important now as a team to show character without it no matter the talent, nothing can be achieved. 'Focus on set-pieces' Aware that his team will find it difficult to keep hold of the ball at a stretch in all their three group matches, Stimac plans to use et-pieces as a way of scoring goals, even of against the run of play. On his recommendation, the AIFF has hired Stimac's former West Ham team-mate and England World Cupper Trevor Sinclair as assistant coach to specifically improve dead-ball training during the tournament. Stimac said that he wants defensive compactness, offensive transition, and sharpness in set-pieces. It’s also very important to work on man marking inside the box, he said, pointing out that they have conceded because of it in their last few games. Apart from being ranked much higher than India, Australia Uzbekistan and Syria are technically good, physically strong, with great speed, Stimac said. Hence they won't have much difference in approach for these three games with his main focus now is checking the fitness level of players and finding a way for further development in the next two weeks, he added.",
