    "text": "He believes that the strongest arguments for Kyiv's accession to NATO and for the provision of American aid to the Armed Forces should be made in the United States.\\\"There will certainly be difficulties with some NATO members\\\" in Ukraine's negotiations to join the alliance, Johnson said.\\\"We know who they are, we know the problems, we know what they are. But at the end of the day, the country that matters is the United States. Because NATO is an expression of the military power of the United States in Europe. It's a vehicle for that. And so this argument [about the need for Ukraine to join NATO] has to be won in the United States.\\\" In terms of combat power and army efficiency, \\\"there is hardly a NATO force in the entire alliance that can really match Ukraine.If the West wants to help Kyiv win properly, \\\"we need to give Ukraine everything it needs to win faster.”\\\"We need the State Department and the Congressmen to think about all the things they are accomplishing from a NATO perspective,” he added.“You [Ukraine] are pushing Russia back, you are stopping Russian aggression, you are protecting all the other former Soviet countries and satellites. You're defending the Baltic states, you're defending Georgia - you're defending all these areas from invasion. You heard what Putin said about Poland, and I didn't like it. You are shutting all that down. You are sending a message to China about Russian power,\\\" Johnson listed his arguments. \\\"Yes, you are sending a message to China about Russian power, which is not very much power, but you are also sending a message to everybody in the world that it is not wise to attack your neighbor. Because in the end, if you attack your neighbor, you lose. And that is a great message.”This is the message that should be discussed in the debate over the $60 billion in U.S. aid.\\\"This is a huge savings and the best investment in the security of the world that can be made,\\\" Johnson said. \\\"And it will save trillions. It could potentially save trillions of dollars in the future if, God forbid, we have an even bigger war. If Putin or somebody else does even more of this madness.\\\"",
