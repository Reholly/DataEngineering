    "text": "“In general, we can speak of a positive trend in our actions in the Black Sea,” he said.“In particular, we can say that today the initiative is on our side. In this case, the initiative means a lot, because it gives us the opportunity to impose our own terms of engagement.”Any military vessel flying the Russian flag in the Black Sea is a legitimate target for Ukraine.It is quite difficult to predict what will happen this year, as the enemy adapts and responds to new challenges, requiring the Ukrainian armed forces to plan new operations in a more detailed and coordinated manner.On March 7, Pletenchuk said that the Russian Black Sea Fleet had more than 30 operational ships, including approximately ten Kalibr missile carriers, three of which are submarines.On Feb. 6, the Ukrainian military’s Centre for Strategic Communications (StratCom) reported that around one-third of the Russian Black Sea Fleet warships had been destroyed or damaged by Kyiv since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion.24 out of 74 Russian Black Sea Fleet warships, which the enemy possessed before the invasion, have been destroyed or damaged by the Ukrainian Armed Forces.Ukrainian forces have been regularly destroying Russian Black Sea Fleet ships since the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.Pletenchuk said on Feb. 15 that only five of the 13 large landing ships of the Russian Black Sea Fleet remained.On March 5, the $64 million Russian Black Sea Fleet patrol ship Sergey Kotov was destroyed by MAGURA V5 maritime drones in the territorial waters of Ukraine near the Kerch Strait.",
