    "text": "UK Defence Secretary in Kyiv urges the world to wake up and support Ukraine Grant Shapps, the UK Secretary of Defence, has recorded a video from the centre of Kyiv in which he urges the world to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression. Source: Shapps on [European Pravda](https://www.eurointegration.com.ua/news/2024/03/8/7181337/) Quote: \"I’m the British Defence Secretary here in Kyiv to raise the alarm, because what would it say if we allow a democratic country to be taken over by a dictator like Putin? What would it say about our values of freedom and democracy?\" He emphasised that this should not be the case and that the West can easily attract resources if it has the will. \"So the message is simple: this is our wake-up call for the world, let’s make sure Ukraine wins this war,\" Shapps said. In his note, he stated that the UK has gone above and beyond by providing Ukraine with the largest military support package ever. \"Every nation must now do the same and ensure freedom triumphs over tyranny,\" Shapps concluded. I’m in Kyiv to raise the alarm to the democratic world - we must make sure Ukraine wins this war.— Rt Hon Grant Shapps MP (@grantshapps) The UK has stepped up to do more than ever, with our largest military support package to date. Every nation must now do the same and ensure freedom triumphs over tyranny.
