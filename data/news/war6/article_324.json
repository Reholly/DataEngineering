    "text": "Heavyweight hope Justis Huni survived a last-round scare against an emotionally charged opponent before keeping his unbeaten record in tact with a points win in Saudi Arabia. The 24-year-old Queenslander, taking on his biggest test yet on the undercard of the money-spinning Anthony Joshua-headed show in Riyadh on Friday (Saturday AEDT), found himself being hit with a barrage of blows in the 10th round of his contest with Kevin Lerena. The 31-year-old South African had decided to go ahead with the fight despite having announced on the eve of the contest his mother had recently died. After putting up a solid display but clearly going into the last round behind on points, Lerena had been urged by his corner to \"do it for your mother\" and he responded to the exhortation by piling into a last-gasp attack on the unbeaten Australian. But Huni managed to hold on, despite being seriously wobbled with one left hook, weathering the storm to deservedly land his ninth straight victory with a unanimous points decision, being awarded the verdict 96-94, 96-94 and 98-92 on the judges&apos; cards. Huni was left relieved, saying in the ring afterwards: \"I done all the hard work in the gym and I&apos;m glad my legs were strong enough to stick it out.\"",
