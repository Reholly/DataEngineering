Every nation must now do the same and ensure freedom triumphs over tyranny.”\nThe defence secretary encouraged Britain’s allies to reflect on their democratic values, asking: “What would it say if we allow a democratic country to be taken over by a dictator?”\nMr Shapps yesterday met with President Zelensky in Kyiv, where he announced Britain’s pledge to purchase an additional 10,000 drones for Ukraine, worth £325 million.\nFollow the latest updates below\n03:13 PM GMT That’s all for today Thank you for tuning in to today’s live blog.

Luxembourg has joined a Czech-led coalition of European nations supplying ammunition to Ukraine, Yuriko Backes, the country’s foreign minister, said.\nMr Backes added that Luxembourg has recently delivered 6,000 155mm shells to Ukraine.\nThe announcement comes after the group of countries revealed they purchased 800,000 artillery shells for Ukraine.\nSee post at 10.28am for more information.\n01:50 PM GMT Ukrainian drone strike kills two, Russia claims A Ukrainian drone attack on the Russian border region of Belgorod has killed two people, the Russian governor said.\nThree Ukrainian “kamikaze drones” hit the village of Rozhdestvenska, Vyacheslav Gladkov said in a post on Telegram.\n“As a result of the explosions, two people were killed and a third man was serious wounded,” he said, adding that an ambulance crew had been dispatched to the site to treat the victims.\nRussia’s defence ministry issued a series of statements this morning claiming that its air defence forces had downed several Ukrainian drones over the Belgorod region.\nSitting close to the border with Ukraine, Belgorod has come under frequent artillery, rocket and drone attack throughout the two-year conflict.\n01:33 PM GMT Ukraine war decimates Black Sea dolphin populations While the war in Ukraine has let to untold human suffering, it has also had a devastating impact on animal populations.\nAround 50,000 dolphins died in the Black Sea in 2022 owing to the impact of the war, the Economist reported.\nIvan Rusev, scientific director of the Tuzly Lagoons National Nature Park in Bessarabia, told the magazine he is “99 per cent certain” this mass slaughter has been caused by Russian naval sonar, which blinds the notoriously intelligent mammals, as well as explosions and birds from white phosphorous bombs.\nLuckily, since Russia’s Black Sea fleet was driven back last year, the number of dead dolphins washing up on Ukraine’s beaches has fallen “drastically”.\nIn other more optimistic news for animal lovers, fox populations have boomed in Ukraine due to a hunting ban, causing the native population to leap from an estimated 200,000 two years ago to more than 500,000 now, Viktor Chervonyi, the president of Ukraine’s hunting association, said.\nUnfortunately, their blossoming numbers have also coincided with a surge in rabies cases, with the number of people seeking post-bite rabies inoculations in the first nine month of last year rising by 40 per cent.\nElsewhere, Ukraine’s much smaller wolf and racoon-dog populations are also soaring.\n12:41 PM GMT Terror attack likely in Moscow today, UK and US warn The UK and US embassies in Russia have warned that a terrorist attack could take place in Moscow within the next 24 hours.\nThe security alert, issued by the US embassy and repeated by the UK, urged American citizens to “avoid large gatherings over the next 48 hours”.\nThe embassy said it is “monitoring reports that extremists have imminent plans to target large gatherings in Moscow, to include concerts,” but it did not specify what kind of threats it referred to, or who might be behind them.\nRussia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) said on March 7 that its agents had thwarted a potential Islamic State terrorist attack on a Moscow synagogue, with state-owned media reporting the militants behind the plot were killed.
