    "text": "\"We need to be ahead\": Da Vinci Wolves battalion company commander on technological revolution in Ukrainian army Oleksandr Yabchanka, commander of the Honor Company of the Da Vinci Wolves battalion, said that the Ukrainian Defence Forces are already using robotic platforms in combat, which have even been noticed by Russian army He shared this information on Espreso TV. When asked whether the Ukrainian Defence Forces use robotic platforms in combat, Yabchanka said: \"There are systems that could even be seen in Russian social media, some platforms have already been spotted by the enemy and, obviously, if they have been spotted by the enemy, they are already in use.\" The company commander calls for keeping up with modern technologies and implementing them as quickly as possible during this war. \"We have to realise that we are doomed to run ahead of the enemy in terms of technology if we want to win this war, and we obviously do. There are smart developers, there are brave units that are ready to implement these developments. So there is something to work with, we just need to scale up this experience as much as possible, in other words, to have more units like ours. We encourage them, we invite combat units to send representatives, we will teach you everything we know, we are constantly communicating with those combat units that use it, we share our experience. You know, the more effective the networking is, the sooner we will make this military technological revolution,\" Yabchanka concluded. - The Brave1 Defence Technology Cluster has allocated $3 million for defence innovations. Deputy PM and Minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine Mykhailo Fedorov said that the grants will be allocated for UAVs, robotic platforms and electronic warfare systems.
