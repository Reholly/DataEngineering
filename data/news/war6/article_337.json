Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala at a press conference with the French president in Prague, March 5, 2024. AFP - LUDOVIC MARIN By: RFI Follow Advertisement Read more With our correspondent in Prague, With our correspondent in Prague, Alexis Rosenzweig The President of the Czech Republic Petr Pavel, a former general and former head of the NATO military committee, previously announced that the purchase of ammunition from third countries and organized by Prague had already been fully financed. The head of government, Petr Fiala, wanted to correct that for the moment, the amounts promised or already paid by different countries covered the purchase of 300,000 shells. “ Our goal is to provide much more!” We continue to look for partners so that we can continue to support Ukraine in its courageous fight against the Russian aggressor ,” added Petr Fiala, who is leading this project. The said project is already supported by several European Union (EU) countries including France – President Emmanuel Macron announced it during his visit to the Czech capital this week – and Germany, but also by states not not part of the EU, such as Canada or Norway. The Czech Republic has already delivered significant military equipment to the Ukrainian army and significant private fundraising has also been organized since the start of the Russian invasion. One of the last should allow the purchase of several thousand drones.
