    "text": "Trending:\n\"Groundhog Day\" for the occupiers: Ukrainian marines showed how they give nightmares to Putin's troops. Video\nUkrainian marines continue to destroy Putin's terrorists at the front. Despite the huge losses, the enemy continues to put pressure on the frontline, while Ukrainian defenders are increasing the statistics of enemy losses.\nThe fighters of the 501st Separate Marine Battalion and the Apostle Peter's Couriers demonstrated the elimination of the invaders. This was reported on\nTelegram by the 36th Separate Marine Brigade named after Rear Admiral Mykhailo Bilynsky.\nThe marines note that the Russian invaders repeat the fate of their destroyed colleagues every time. The defenders eliminate the personnel of Putin's army using artillery and FPV drones.\n\"You run out of the woods, get beaten up by Mykolaiv marines, and return to your taiga in zinc. If you are lucky, of course. The 501st Separate Marine Battalion and the Apostle Peter's Couriers of the Black Battalion are working,\" the marines write.\nAs a reminder, Ukraine's defenders neutralized 900 Russian invaders over the course of March 9. The total losses of the Russian army personnel in the full-scale war reach 424,060 killed and wounded.\nAs reported by OBOZ.UA, aerial reconnaissance aircraft of the State Border Guard Service destroyed a howitzer, an ammunition warehouse and a car of the occupiers on the left bank of the Kherson region. The soldiers showed a video of enemy equipment burning powerfully as a result of drone drops.\nOnly verified information is available on our\nTelegram channel OBOZ.UA and Viber.
