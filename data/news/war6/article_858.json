    "text": "Iran proposes six practical proposals for Gaza TEHRAN- Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian has proposed six practical proposals for resolving issues in the Gaza Strip during an emergency meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. The list of proposals is as follows: 1. Expeling Israeli regime from UNGA and preventing its membership in other international bodies. 2. Promptly halting genocide and war crimes in Gaza, withdrawal of Israeli army from the Strip and provision of immediate humanitarian aid to the enclave. 3. Providing temporary accommodation for the homeless. 4. Setting up hospitals, medical centers and equipping them across Gaza. 5. Transferring the injured, especially children and women, outside Palestine for medical treatment. 6. Reopening Rafah border crossing, with joint cooperation of UN chief and Egyptian government. During the meeting, Iran’s foreign minister said Muslim countries should take more decisive and concrete steps to pressure Israel to cease its genocidal attacks on Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip. “As we witness the inaction of the United Nations Security Council against Israeli crimes, it becomes urgent and necessary for Islamic countries to find practical solutions and to take more serious actions in support of the people of Palestine,” the top diplomat explained while warning that the humanitarian situation in Gaza is turning into an unprecedented disaster. “Undoubtedly, any economic cooperation with this regime, and financial, military, or political assistance to it, amounts to practical cooperation and assistance in the crimes of the Zionists and facilitating the continuation of their heinous acts, including the genocide of Palestinians.” Several Islamic countries have been accused of having lackluster and insufficient responses to Israeli crimes in Gaza. Reports show that Turkey, despite President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s strong words against the Israeli regime, has increased its trade with Israel since October 7th. An unidentified member of Turkey’s Exporters Union has told Turkish media that Ankara is currently providing 50% of food consumed in the occupied territories. Furthermore, some Arab states like Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and the UAE have formed a land corridor to help the regime bypass the Yemeni blockade in the Red Sea, according to Israeli reports. During his speech, Amir Abdollahian called on Islamic nations to cease all ties with Israel and recall their envoys from the occupied territories. On Monday, at a weekly news briefing on Monday, the spokesman for Iran’s Foreign Ministry, Nasser Kanaani, emphasized the significance of the OIC emergency meeting, stating that the 57-member group is “facing a test” over Israel’s genocide in the Gaza Strip. “This cruel war continues in the shadow of warmongering by the Zionist regime’s officials and the unlimited support of the United States. The OIC is facing a test to show how much of its capacity it will use in support of Palestine,” he said. “The leaders of Muslim countries took a strong and unanimous decision that requires an effective step to defend Palestine, with an urgency of stopping the war.”",
