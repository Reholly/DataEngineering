    "text": "Prime Minister Orbán at the Antalya Diplomacy Forum\n“The fact that the Ukraine war appears hopeless is paralyzing European politics,” analyzed Viktor Orbán on Friday evening at the Antalya Diplomacy Forum (ADF).\nThe Prime Minister is part of the camp that answers the question of who time is working for in the conflict in favor of Russia. “If we can assume that time is working in Russia’s favor, we should end the war today rather than tomorrow.” Hungary’s position is also not consistent with that according to which many Western countries view this conflict as “our war”. “How do we want to get out of the affair if the war is possibly lost?” – Orbán asked.\nOrbán: “Whatever is good for Hungary, I support”\nThe Hungarian advises those who call him “Putin’s mutt” or “Trojan horse” to urgently consult a psychotherapist. “I don’t analyze the Ukraine war through Ukrainian or Putin’s lenses, I have the Hungarian perspective. I represent my country, my nation. What’s good for Hungary, I support, what’s not, I try to fend off – it’s that simple.” As an example, he cited the Hungarians who have lived in Zakarpattia for a thousand years and are now being drafted into the Ukrainian army. “Hungarians are dying in the Ukraine war,” warned the Prime Minister, addressing the Western warmongers. Peace would also bring security to the lives of Hungarians.\n“Of course I imagine Hungary’s future in the EU. Anyone who is Hungarian is European. This does not contradict our role in the Council of the Turkic States. We are probably the only people in Europe who are proud to come from the East.”\nRelated Articles: Stéphane Bernard Allegations: Presumption of Innocence vs Political Smear Campaign\nKudos to Trump\nViktor Orbán confirmed that he would meet with former President Donald Trump in Florida next week. “I have respect for him. With Trump as President of the United States, we would not have a war in Ukraine today. He is the greatest hope that peace will return.”\n#Orbán #Trump #greatest #hope #peace\nRelated posts:\n\"Big Heart Organization in Sharjah Provides 5,000 Food Parcels in Bridges of Good Campaign for Quake...
