    "text": "OAKLAND, Ala. ( WAFF ) - A U.S. Navy veteran from Lauderdale County knows what it’s like to feel the shock of an atomic bomb. “Like ants all over you. It felt like I was on fire,” Jimmy Wallace said, according to WAFF’s news partners at the TimesDaily . “When they dropped that thing you could see the bone of your arm.” And as a young sailor aboard the USS Curtiss AV-4 in the 1950s, it was all part of the job. During his four years in the Navy, Wallace said he experienced at least 10-12 nuclear blasts, according to the TimesDaily. Part of his duty was to explore radioactive islands, just days after atomic blasts, as part of military nuclear testing in the Marshall Islands. Last week, Wallace was awarded the Atomic Veterans Commemorative Service Medal by the U.S. Department of Defense at the American Legion Post 11 in Florence. A newly created award, Wallace’s daughter Shonda Hernandez filled out paperwork for her father to receive it. “It tickled me,” Wallace said. “I was glad to get it. It’s been a long time coming.” According to the TimesDaily, Wallace said he would now love to start a movement to have a highway in the Shoals area named Nuclear Veterans Highway.
