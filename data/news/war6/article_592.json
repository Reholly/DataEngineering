    "text": "A late Kai Havertz goal earned Arsenal a dramatic 2-1 win against Brentford at the Emirates in Saturday’s Premier League.\nHavertz has now scored a goal in each of his last four Premier League games.\nThe win means Arsenal go top in the league table with Liverpool and Manchester City facing each other on Sunday.\nAfter dominanting the early part of the game Arsenal deservedly took the lead on 19 minutes as Declan Rice headed home Ben White’s cross.\nBut in four minutes of first half added time Aaron Ramsdale, who was in goal for Arsenal as David Raya could not face his parent club Brentford, gifted the visitors the equaliser.\nAfter receiving a back pass, he was quickly closed down by Yoane Wissa and saw his attempted clearance hit the DR Congo player and ended inside the net.\nRamsdale made up for his mistake with two brilliant saves to keep the score at 1-1.\nIn the 86th minute Arsenal got the winner as White was the provider again as his cross was headed home by a well positioned Havertz.",
