We knew it was going to be a tough rally but we prepared well for it.”\nShe added: “Hope we keep our pace as high as it was in the third stage in order to gain more points and win the final stage.”\nSeel said: “Oh yeah. Super happy. That was really cool.”\nPoland’s Ewelina Chlebowska and her German co-driver Hanna Riehle came in second, with 1,190.870 points, and currently lead the overall standings with a total of 3,428.603.\nSaudi Arabia’s racer Dania Akeel and her navigator, Senegal’s Syndiely Wade, came third with 1,183.509 points, and maintain their second place in the overall standings with 3,412.907.\nThe fourth and final stage of the rally begins on Friday morning, heading to King Abdullah Economic City in Rabigh.\nThe 2024 edition, titled “Her Passion Changes the World,” is aimed at empowering women in motorsport.\nThe event has attracted 110 contestants from 37 countries.",
