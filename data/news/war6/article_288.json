    "text": "Once Again, Indian Warship Rescues Missile Hit Crew In Gulf of Aden NEW DELHI (ANI) – Once again the Indian Navy responded swiftly to a distress call from the Gulf of Aden where a merchant vessel caught fire after being hit by a missile, and rescued 21 crew members, including one Indian national. The Navy said Barbados Flagged Bulk Carrier MV True Confidence was hit by a drone/ missile on March 6, resulting in a fire onboard and critical injuries to some of the crew members forcing the crew to abandon the ship. INS Kolkata, deployed for Maritime Security Operations arrived at the scene and rescued 21 crew members from the life raft using its integral helicopter and boats. Critical medical aid was also provided to the injured crew by the ship’s medical team. The rescued crew, including the critically injured personnel, were evacuated to Djibouti. Earlier, INS Kolkata responded to another distress call from a Liberian-flagged container vessel, MSC Sky II which was attacked by a drone or missile in the southeast of Aden.",
