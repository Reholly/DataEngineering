    "text": "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) applauded President Joe Biden for his delivery of his State of the Union address, which multiple news outlets described as “fiery” and which Axios called “commmanding.” Schumer wrote: “What the American people heard tonight was a leader who spoke directly to them, acknowledging their needs and sharing in their hopes for the future, reminding us why America is a beacon of hope to the rest of the world and the work that must be done to maintain that status.” Schumer, who continues to urge the House GOP to pass the $95.34 billion national security supplemental package (which includes $60 billion to support Ukraine), invited Andrii Chevozorov as one of his guests to the SOTU. Chevozorov is a 25-year-old Junior Lieutenant in the Ukrainian Army “who risked everything in battle and lost his leg to a landmine,” said Schumer.
