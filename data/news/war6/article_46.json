    "text": "The new exhibition “Another Eye” presented at the Antoine Chevalier gallery in the West Village is a celebration of imagination, play of colors, lights, and the unexpected. Ukrainian artist Anastasia Belous, who currently lives in Spain after leaving her country in 2015 due to the war in Crimea, presents a series of works revealing her vision of surrealist painting – the centenary of which is being celebrated this year. Witches on an airplane wing, women and children adopted by nature, giant rabbit, hairy chicken… the scenes follow one another, like a joyful parade, on the walls of the new pop-up gallery by French gallery owner Antoine Chevalier.\nDespite this apparent joy, Anastasia Belous’ paintings are all about Ukraine and war. Since the new Russian invasion two years ago, the country has seen millions of people leave, mainly women and children, uprooted migrants on the roads far from their homes, without knowing what the future holds for them. It is this other view of the war, from the side of these exiles, that Anastasia Belous proposes to bring to this tragedy.\nThe exhibition opens this Thursday March 7 from 5pm to 8pm at 178 Bleecker Street . On display until March 30.\n“The building fish, Anastasia Belous at the Antoine Chevalier gallery in New York . © Gallery Antoine Chevalier\n2024-03-07 17:37:40\n#surrealism #Anastasia #Belous #Antoine #Chevalier #gallery #York #French #Morning\nRelated posts: Thionville.
