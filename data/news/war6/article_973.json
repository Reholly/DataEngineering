    "text": "Oscars 2024: Celebs Wear 'Red Pins' To Demand Ceasefire In Gaza In a powerful display of solidarity, prominent celebrities, including Billie Eilish, Finneas, Mark Ruffalo, Ava DuVernay, and Ramy Youssef, graced the red carpet at the 96th Academy Awards adorned with small red pins. These pins, featuring the silhouette of a hand with a black heart positioned at the palm, turned heads and raised questions among fans regarding their significance. The pins, as revealed by \"Poor Things\" actor Ramy Youssef in an interview with Variety, symbolize a call for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in the ongoing [Israel-Hamas conflict](https://www.indiatimes.com/news/world/israel-hamas-war-68-journalists-killed-so-far-as-israel-continues-to-pound-gaza-623967.html). Youssef explained that the pins are part of a creatives-led initiative demanding peace in Gaza, emphasizing the need for safety, justice, and lasting peace for the [Palestinian people](https://www.indiatimes.com/news/world/cries-of-child-amputees-fill-the-air-in-gaza-city-620052.html). The big fashion message at the Oscars tonight was the red Artists4Ceasefire pins worn by attendees including Mark Ruffalo, Billie Eilish and Ramy Youssef.â€” Tony Bravo (@TonyBravoSF) [pic.twitter.com/SdecTY1kVW] [March 11, 2024] According to the New York Times, the pins were provided by Artists4Ceasefire, a collective of celebrities and entertainment industry members who signed an open letter urging President Biden to call for a ceasefire. Notable signatories of the letter include Jessica Chastain, Quinta Brunson, Richard Gere, America Ferrera, Cate Blanchett, Lupita Nyong'o, and Mahershala Ali. The open letter calls for urgent action to halt the violence in Israel and Gaza, highlighting the human toll of the conflict and urging leaders to honor the lives in the Holy Land. It specifically emphasizes the impact on children and refugees, stressing the necessity of allowing humanitarian aid to reach the affected civilians. \"The pin symbolizes collective support for an immediate and permanent ceasefire, the release of all hostages, and the urgent delivery of humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza,\" stated Artists4Ceasefire in a news release. In addition to the red pins, actors Milo Machado-Graner and Swann Arlaud of 'Anatomy of a Fall' wore pins featuring the Palestinian flag. Meanwhile, outside the Dolby Theatre, several protestors took to the streets of Hollywood, disrupting traffic to express their support for Palestine. The Oscar ceremony, traditionally a platform for celebrating achievements in the film industry, saw celebrities leverage their visibility to advocate for peace and draw attention to the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the region.",
