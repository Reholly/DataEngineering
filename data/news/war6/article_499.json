    "text": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday inaugurated the strategic all-weather Sela Tunnel that connects Tezpur in Assam to Tawang in the West Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh, close to China border.\nAlso read: Bichom becomes 27th district of Arunachal Pradesh\nThe tunnel, situated at an altitude of 13,000 feet, is an engineering marvel constructed by the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) at a cost of ₹825 crore. It will reduce the travel time by an hour.\nSpeaking on the occasion, the Ministry of Defence stated that the Prime Minister criticised previous regimes for neglecting the development of the border villages. Modi said his work style is driven by the needs of the nation and not for electoral considerations.\nHe promised the defence personnel that he would come to meet them at this engineering marvel in his next term. Modi also voiced the Government’s unwavering commitment to the development of the Northeast region.\nThe tunnel will provide all-weather connectivity to Tawang across Sela Pass on the Balipara - Chariduar - Tawang Road, boosting the preparedness of the Armed Forces and augmenting the socio-economic development of the border region.\nWork on many tunnels is going on in the region, the PM added. The Tunnel has been constructed using the new Austrian tunnelling method and incorporates safety features of the highest standards.\nAlso read: Tezu Airport to be re-inaugurated on September 24\nThe tunnel has been completed in five years, as the foundation stone for construction was laid by the PM on February 09, 2019 and now, it has been opened, overcoming challenges of difficult terrain and adverse weather conditions, the MoD stated.\nIn the last three years, the BRO has completed a record 330 infrastructure projects at the cost of ₹8,737 crore.",
