    "text": "As of: March 9, 2024, 11:24 p.m By: Philipp Bräuner Comments Press Split Chinese engineers have developed a new drone that could revolutionize the construction and use of remote-controlled flying robots. Xi'an - The competition for air sovereignty has reached a new level. At the Northwest China University in the city of Xi'an in Shaanxi Province, researchers have apparently developed a drone with a completely new propulsion mechanism. Physically, however, the technology is old. Because it is based directly on the flapping of birds' wings. Russia is also constantly testing new drones. China develops new drone with bird-like propulsion Ornithopter instead of quadrocopter: Chinese engineers have developed a drone that does not take off with rotors like this one, but with flapping wings. © Mark Schiefelbein/dpa A video introducing the newly developed aircraft was posted on the X channel of the state-controlled news agency China News . Its functionality is presented there with animations, detailed shots and individual flight scenes. The new aircraft called the “Small Falcon” is being highly praised by other state media in China. The new technology gives the machine the “highest maneuverability and the greatest possible bird-likeness” of its kind, according to the Chinese newspaper Global Times . As far as possible uses are concerned, the post itself talks about “ecological monitoring and environmental protection”. According to the Global Times , the small drone can also be used for “reconnaissance, surveillance and even precision strikes in special operations.” China is apparently also developing high-speed spy drones for the same purpose.

While drones with rigid wings and rotors rely primarily on electromagnetic waves for camouflage, the “Small Falcon” uses its habitus. “Even if you see the aircraft, you are more likely to ignore it because you would think it is a bird,” the Global Times quoted an anonymous expert as saying. Ukraine wants to use a new weapon against Russia's “moving targets”. Such mimetic concealment has probably been a goal of engineers at Northwest China University for some time. According to Spiegel, there were reports of pigeon-like drones there as early as 2018. At least the myth of these spy birds has recently had an effect. In the simmering conflict with China, a pigeon was taken into custody in India last year. The reason: suspected espionage. ( pkb )",
