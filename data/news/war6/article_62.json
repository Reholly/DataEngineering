    "text": "Those who serve: The artist who's painted World War II pilots BISMARCK, N.D. (KMOT) - Less than one percent of the 16 million soldiers from the US military are alive today according to the National World War II website. In this week’s, “Those who serve” we highlight a veteran dedicated to keeping some of their stories alive. It’s been almost 80 years since World War II ended but farmer and illustrator Scott Nelson is passing their experiences on to the next generation. Bismarck resident John Rish said he came to Nelson’s talk, not expecting to recognize some of the people he mentioned. ”I was pleasantly surprised that we have someone southwest of Mandan who has painted all these wonderful, wonderful paintings and done all this history review of these World War Two veterans,” said Rish. Scott said since most of the World War II veterans are gone now he wanted them to be remembered. He says he’s always been interested in aviation, art and their experiences. The collection of paintings started with his first interview with a man named Noble Peterson. ”He ended up shooting down a German plane and the guy parachuted and then he flew by the guy - to German hanging and waved at him and then the guy waved back,” said Scott. Scott’s immersion into the lives of veterans has impacted the veterans who are still here. His older brother, Gary R. Nelson was a Vietnam veteran and he was in the audience. Gary said a few years ago that would’ve been unusual since he didn’t like getting involved in post-military-related events. “All of a sudden it became important to me, the past, which I would’ve never talked about before,” said Gary. He said with Scott’s help he’s joined a couple of veterans’ organizations and participated in similar activities. Scott said in his experience veterans are more comfortable sharing their experiences around the age of 80. ”I know there’s a lot of guys from the Vietnam War or another that don’t open up about that,” said Scott. Scott finished his last World War II aviator painting in 2007. Each painting was also signed by the veterans who inspired it. Copyright 2024 KFYR. All rights reserved.",
