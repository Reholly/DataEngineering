    "text": "The abducted Junior Commissioned Officer (JCO) of the Indian Army, Konsam Kheda Singh, who was taken from his home in Manipur's Thoubal district earlier in the day, has been rescued by security forces.\nA coordinated joint search operation was launched by security forces to rescue Singh.\nIndian Army JCO Freed From Abduction\n\"The JCO was safely rescued at 6:30 PM on March 8, 2024, as a result of the synergized efforts of the security forces,\" stated the Army. \"The JCO is currently at Waikhong Police Station (near Kakching) in Thoubal district, and Manipur Police is investigating the incident.\"\nThe cause of the abduction remains unknown, but initial reports suggest extortion as the motive, as Singh&apos;s family had previously received such threats.\nThis marks the fourth incident since the onset of the conflict in Manipur where soldiers, either on leave, on duty, or their relatives, have been targeted.\nIn September, a former Assam Regiment soldier, Serto Thangthang Kom, was kidnapped and killed by an unidentified armed group from the valley. He was posted in Manipur&apos;s Leimakhong with the Defence Service Corps (DSC).\nIn November, four family members of a serving soldier were abducted and later killed in Imphal West district. They were identified as family members of Henthing Haokip, an Indian Army soldier serving in Jammu and Kashmir.\nIn February, an Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP) from Manipur Police was attacked in his house in Imphal city and subsequently abducted. Though the police did not name the group behind the abduction, individuals familiar with the situation suggested the radical Meitei outfit Arambai Tenggol may have been involved.\nOfficials assert that the ethnic violence has degenerated into anarchy, with underground militant groups regaining support.\nSaumya Joshi Oneindia",
