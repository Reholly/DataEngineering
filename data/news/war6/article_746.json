    "text": "This is the dramatic moment a Plymouth-based Royal Navy warship shot down two Houthi attack drones in the Red Sea. Defence Secretary Grant Shapps said the incident overnight saw HMS Richmond use its Sea Ceptor missiles to repel the attack. US Central Command reported that 15 drones in total were brought down by group vessels and planes during assaults in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden early on Saturday. A video, released by the Ministry of Defence, shows flashes of light as the missiles are launched into the air at the Houthi attack drones. Defence Secretary Grant Shapps said: \"The UK and our allies will continue to take the action necessary to save lives and protect freedom of navigation.\" Confirmation came from the [Ministry of Defence](https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/ministry-of-defence) that the Type 23 frigate jointly with international allies, \"fully repelled\" a Houthi drone attack, fortunately resulting in no injuries or damage, reports [the Express](https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1875651/hms-richmond-houthi-drones-Red-Sea).

Despite having little or no ties to Israel, the Houthis, originating from Yemen, have explained their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea as a reaction to happenings in Gaza. These attacks on vessels travelling through the Red Sea have led to ships rerouting around southern Africa instead of using the Suez Canal between Europe and Asia, increasing costs and posing a potential risk to the global economy. The UK sent HMS Richmond to the Red Sea at the start of January. HMS Diamond and HMS Lancaster were already in the region to the region to protect container ships from assaults by the Houthis. The warship is part of a US-led coalition named Operation Prosperity Guardian, which has been protecting trade ships as they journey through the region and towards the Suez Canal and Europe. At the time, Shapps told MPs that HMS Richmond, a type 23 frigate, would be posted to protect merchant vessels - but stressed the warship is only being deployed to the Gulf to replace a British vessel already on patrol there.
