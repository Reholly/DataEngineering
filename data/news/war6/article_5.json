    "text": "On February 24, an influential conference convened in Paris to commemorate International Women’s Day. Attended by numerous global leaders, lawmakers, and human rights advocates, the event served as a platform for sharing profound insights on the pivotal role of gender equality and emancipation in the ongoing struggle against tyranny within Iran. Furthermore, participants shed light on the broader impact of these efforts, addressing the pervasive influence of Islamic extremism propagated by Tehran. The conference brought together a diverse array of perspectives, emphasizing the collective commitment to advancing women’s rights and combating oppressive forces on both national and global scales. In her [address, Mrs. Maryam Rajavi](https://www.maryam-rajavi.com/en/international-womens-day-gender-equality-prime-challenge-of-our-time/), President-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), emphasized the indispensable role of women in political leadership and the liberation of Iran from the oppressive regime. She articulated that active and equal participation of women in political leadership is not only essential for democracy but also pivotal for the emancipation of men. She underscored that defeating the Velayat-e Faqih regime hinges significantly on the pioneering efforts of women. Against the backdrop of global conflicts and humanitarian crises, Mrs. Rajavi highlighted the plight of innocent women and children who often bear the brunt of such turmoil. She attributed much of the chaos and bloodshed in Iran and the wider region to the Iranian regime, labeling it as the “head of the snake.” Drawing from history, Mrs. Rajavi acknowledged the pivotal role of women in the post-1979 revolution era, particularly within progressive forces and the [People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI/MEK)](https://english.mojahedin.org/a-primer-on-the-history-of-the-peoples-mojahedin-organization-of-iran/). She commemorated the sacrifices made by countless women who fought against the reactionary forces, enduring torture and execution at the hands of the ruling mullahs. Mrs. Rajavi cited the significant presence of women within the PMOI, with numerous women holding top leadership positions over the decades. She also emphasized the substantial representation of women within the NCRI, with 56 percent of its members being women. She lauded the bravery of Iranian women who have been at the forefront of uprisings and resistance movements against the clerical regime, showcasing their pivotal role in shaping Iran’s future. In her closing remarks, Mrs. Rajavi expressed unwavering faith in the ability of women and men who rebel against the oppressive ideology of the regime to pave the path to freedom and equality. She envisioned a world where every woman is recognized as an individual with the right to choose and control her own destiny, free from objectification and oppression. When aiming for a deep and radical implementation of equality, we encounter this question: Does this transformation involve marginalizing men? No, solutions that seek to replace men with women do not lead to the liberation of [#women]. The new message of the Iranian Resistance is… [pic.twitter.com/5L8V8Fd7m8] — Maryam Rajavi (@Maryam_Rajavi) [February 27, 2024] Former French Minister of National Education, Higher Education, and Research, Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, expressed admiration for the unwavering courage of Iranian women who have endured decades of repression under the current regime. She said, “The resistance that is that of Iranian women, their absolutely heroic courage, the sacrifices, the staggering resilience over these four decades of oppression by a religious dictatorship operating under the guise of Islam, all this seems so exorbitant, so extraordinary to me that I almost have a feeling of illegitimacy in addressing them, in glorifying them, in applauding them.” Mrs. Vallaud-Belkacem highlighted the atrocities committed by the regime, including the execution of political prisoners and the systematic discrimination against women. She underscored the urgent need for political action to address gender inequality and human rights abuses in Iran. The former minister praised the resilience of Iranian women who continue to resist despite immense challenges. She called for solidarity and support from the international community in their quest for freedom and democracy. Mrs. Vallaud-Belkacem emphasized the importance of women’s voices in political leadership and stressed the need for gender equality in all spheres of society. She concluded, “Strength, strength to Maryam Rajavi, President-elect of the NCRI, strength to the PMOI activists, strength to all those who fight at the risk of their lives, who resist against Islamist fundamentalism. Strength to the men who accompany them and support them and also pay a very heavy price. Strength to all those who refuse to let silence and indifference cover the atrocities that are still happening today in Iran.” Former Latvian President Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga addressed the gathering with a poignant message of solidarity and resistance against tyranny, particularly highlighting the plight of women under oppressive regimes. Drawing from Latvia’s historical struggles against authoritarianism, President Vīķe-Freiberga emphasized the parallels with the current situation in Iran. President Vīķe-Freiberga condemned the Iranian theocracy’s systematic dehumanization of women and its complicity in supporting oppressive regimes worldwide. She said, “The totalitarian regime is always based on the support of those who find benefit in aiding the dictator who is at its head. And this dependence is an illusion. And I would like to say to the men of Iran, when they tolerate and when they accept the repression and oppression of Iranian women, they are harming their own humanity and their own masculinity.” President Vīķe-Freiberga championed the flame of freedom as a beacon of hope, stressing the importance of individual conscience and the separation of church and state. She reassured the audience that the struggle for freedom and equality will prevail, urging them to remain steadfast in their courage and determination. Drawing from Latvia’s own journey to freedom, President Vīķe-Freiberga expressed solidarity and wished success to all those fighting against tyranny and oppression. In her address, former Ecuadorian President Rosalía Arteaga Serrano voiced unwavering support for the women of Iran and condemned the oppressive practices of the Iranian regime. Drawing from her personal experiences and political journey in Ecuador, she underscored the urgent need to combat discrimination and ensure equal opportunities for women. Mrs. Arteaga Serrano denounced the plight of women in Iran, where many have faced stigmatization, violence, imprisonment, and even death for advocating their basic freedoms. She highlighted the stark reality of political discrimination and gender-based oppression, affirming her commitment to stand in solidarity with Iranian women in their quest for emancipation. The former president of Ecuador said, “The National Council of Resistance of Iran, led by [Mrs. Maryam Rajavi](https://www.maryam-rajavi.com/en/biography/), has shown courage and vision in its fight for the consolidation of rights for all, especially for women in Iran. Its slogan, we can and must, reflects the feeling of an oppressed community in the search of their rights. The need to advocate for women’s rights in Iran cannot be postponed, which will serve to create, in Mrs. Rajavi’s own words, opportunities for women to make autonomous choices, achieve the right to employment, free choice of profession, and other rights.” Mrs. Arteaga Serrano passionately advocated for the full exercise of freedoms in Iran, including the separation of religion and state, the abolition of discriminatory laws, and the establishment of equal rights for women. She underscored the imperative of enacting legislation to protect women from violence and ensure their unfettered participation in all spheres of society. Gracias París por la gran acogida [pic.twitter.com/UqSORvBssT] — Rosalía Arteaga (@rosaliaarteaga) [February 24, 2024] In her speech, Ana Helena Chacón, former Vice President of Costa Rica, emphasized the importance of solidarity and action in the face of oppression. Drawing from Costa Rica’s history as one of the first nations to abolish the death penalty, former VP Chacón emphasized the need for access to justice and the importance of advocating for those unjustly imprisoned. She also spoke out against the imposition of religious beliefs on public policy, advocating for a secular approach that respects human rights and individual freedoms. She condemned gender-based violence and highlighted the plight of Iranian women facing systemic oppression. “We are here because there is love in our hearts and no hate,” Mrs. Chacón declared, emphasizing the importance of love and solidarity in building a peaceful and just society where every woman can pursue her own happiness free from oppression. Promising to continue the fight for freedom and justice, the former Costa Rican VP reaffirmed her commitment to advocating for women’s rights both locally and globally, promising to honor the lives lost and to strive for a better future where oppression and injustice have no place. Anneli Jäätteenmäki, former Prime Minister of Finland, delivered a poignant message of solidarity and support for Iranian women during the conference. Highlighting that it is her first appearance at such an event, Jäätteenmäki expressed deep concern over the treatment of women in Iran and the erosion of their rights. With a tone of shock and disbelief, former PM Jäätteenmäki highlighted the diminishing value, happiness, security, and social participation experienced by women in Iran. She underscored the historical significance of women in Iranian society and lamented the shift towards fundamentalism in the 1970s, which marginalized women and subjugated them to male dominance. Mrs. Jäätteenmäki strongly denounced the Iranian regime’s refusal to recognize women’s rights, emphasizing the need for global support to help Iranian women reclaim their dignity and human rights. She called for a society where men and women could coexist peacefully, free from political executions, massacres, and imprisonment. Concluding her remarks with a note of optimism, the former Finish PM expressed confidence that change is imminent. Her words echoed a collective determination to stand with Iranian women in their struggle for equality and justice. Member of the UK House of Lords, Baroness O’Loan delivered her address at a conference, praising the resilience and determination of Iranian women in their fight against oppression under the current regime. She began by acknowledging the profound impact of Mrs. Rajavi’s leadership, highlighting her role as a beacon of courage for young Iranian girls and the broader resistance movement. Drawing attention to the significant contributions of Iranian women in challenging the regime, Baroness O’Loan emphasized the pivotal role they played in leading the organized resistance movement. Despite facing relentless persecution and terrorism from the regime, their unwavering commitment to freedom and democracy remains steadfast. Baroness O’loan said, “I applaud all those women and young girls in [the Resistance Units](https://www.ncr-iran.org/en/news/iran-resistance/resistance-units-iran-societys-response-to-mullahs-rule-of-terror/) of the PMOI who are bravely confronting the brutal IRGC should be prescribed as a terrorist organization in every country in the world. They have immeasurable courage and they have hope.” Baroness O’Loan condemned the regime’s systematic efforts to undermine the resistance through character assassination, propaganda, and sham prosecutions. She applauded the rejection and condemnation of these tactics by her colleagues in the United Kingdom Parliament and called on European governments to uphold the rights of Iranian opposition members, especially women, in accordance with international law. She emphasized the importance of supporting their efforts to establish a democratic republic in Iran, which she believes will bring stability, prosperity, and peace to the region and the world at large. In her speech, Mrs. Judy Sgro, a former Canadian Minister and current member of Parliament, expressed admiration for the leadership of Mrs. Rajavi and the dedication of her team. She emphasized the urgent need for a free and democratic Iran, highlighting the aspirations of young Iranian women for freedom and pride in their country. She underscored the global responsibility to address the challenges posed by Iran’s actions, which she believes contribute to instability in the Middle East and beyond. The Canadian MP called for accountability for Iran’s behavior and urged individuals to raise awareness and advocate for change. She said, “Iran, in my opinion, is behind everything going on in the Middle East and what is going on in Ukraine and thousands and thousands of people, whether Israeli, Palestinians, Ukrainians or others, are dying and Iran is delivering the instruments of war.” In a significant political announcement, MP Sgro revealed Canada’s intentions to designate the IRGC (Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps) as a terrorist organization, demonstrating Canada’s solidarity with efforts for a free and democratic Iran. She concluded with a rallying call for collective action, stressing that achieving a free and democratic Iran requires the concerted efforts of individuals, governments, and the international community. Grateful for the opportunity to engage with both Madame Maryam Rajavi, President of NCRI, and Candice Bergen. Their passion for making a difference in the world is evident, and I look forward to continued dialogue and cooperation. [#leadership] [#Dialogue] [#Cooperation] [pic.twitter.com/pswFJdqKhm] — Judy Sgro (@JudySgroMP) [February 24, 2024] In her speech, Dutch MEP Dorien Rookmaker likened Maryam Rajavi to Nelson Mandela, praising her innovative leadership and the organization of women within the resistance movement. As a leader of a prominent women’s association in the Netherlands, Rookmaker admired the dedication and organizational skills demonstrated by Mrs. Rajavi and her supporters. MEP Rookmaker emphasized the significance of celebrating the achievements of women worldwide, particularly in the face of oppression and injustice. She commended the men who stood alongside Iranian women in their struggle for freedom and highlighted the resilience of the Iranian Resistance despite severe repression. The Dutch MEP said, “Behind the facade of Iran’s historical beauty lies a regime that suppresses dissent and stifles basic human rights, particularly for women who dare to speak out against injustice. But greatly, the Iranian Resistance stands tall and does not know the meaning of giving up, and this gives us hope.” She also paid tribute to several women imprisoned by the Iranian regime, highlighting their courage and determination to seek justice in the face of adversity. In particular, Mrs. Rookmaker honored Maryam Akbari Monfared, Marzieh Farsi, and Zahra Safaee whose stories symbolized the plight of countless others silenced by the regime. She recounted Monfared’s quest for justice for her siblings executed by the regime and shared Monfared’s hopeful vision of a free Iran. In closing, she remarked, “When I started being a member of parliament in Europe, there was a lot of division among European members of parliament about the situation in Iran. A lot of the members of the European Parliament wanted to continue the policy of appeasement of this terrible regime, but in our last debate, we could see that from left to right, all members of parliament stand behind the opposition of Iran and the movement of Maryam Rajavi.” Gisteren in Parijs kwamen vanuit de hele wereld vrouwen actief of actief geweest in de politiek of strijdend voor mensenrechten steun betuigen aan [@Maryam_Rajavi]de [@cnri]en het 10 punten plan voor een seculier democratisch Iran.

Zij stelt: [https://t.co/XWaHmbbb1n] — Dorien Rookmaker (@RookmakerDorien) [February 26, 2024] Michèle Alliot-Marie, Former Interior, Defence, Foreign, and Justice Minister of France, praised Mrs. Rajavi for her unwavering commitment to shared values. Alliot-Marie expressed solidarity with women worldwide and highlighted the importance of recognizing their struggles, particularly in Iran. She said, “How can we not stand by the women of Iran whom we have seen demonstrate, despite all they risked and going so far as the ultimate sacrifice for our values, those of democracy, those of freedom, those of equality between men and women? They are, just like you, dear Maryam Rajavi, the symbol of refusing to give in to injustice, to ignorance, to stupidity, to dictatorship. They are also, just like you, dear Maryam, a beacon of hope in a part of the world that crystallizes political tensions and geopolitical challenges.” Mr.s Alliot-Marie criticized the Iranian regime’s oppression of women and its disregard for democratic values, citing concerns about its nuclear program and support for terrorist groups. She also emphasized the need for international vigilance and support for those advocating for freedom and equality in Iran. Asserting that Iranians deserve the right to choose their own government, she pledged unwavering support to those fighting for democracy and peace. The former French Minister urged European nations to amplify their support for Iranian women and their quest for freedom. In conclusion, she echoed a message of resilience, reminding the audience that courage leads to victory. With determination, she affirmed, the fight for freedom and equality will prevail. Kathleen Depoorter, member of the Belgian Parliament commended the unwavering resolve of those striving for a free and democratic Iran. She began by emphasizing the regime’s inability to quell the determination of the Iranian people in their pursuit of freedom. The Belgian MP expressed profound admiration for the courage and commitment displayed by Iranian women who have been at the forefront of the resistance movement, enduring unimaginable hardships and sacrificing their lives for the cause of democracy. Mrs. Depoorter said, “Many members of the [PMOI Resistance Units](https://english.mojahedin.org/iranian-resistance-units/) inside Iran, who played, of course, this major role in the resistance and in the protests, are young women. And if we listen to their slogans, we know that they reflect their conviction and their determination to establish this democratic, secular republic. And it also rejects their rejection from all forms of oppression, whether it is by the Shah or by the mullahs.” Depoorter lauded Mrs. Rajavi’s exemplary leadership, highlighting her role as a beacon of hope and inspiration for women both within the resistance movement and across Iran. She commended Rajavi’s stance against compulsory veiling and praised her as a symbol of political leadership and courage. Recognizing the importance of collective action, Depoorter underscored the need for unity and collaboration in the quest for gender equality and the overthrow of the oppressive regime. She assured those in Iran of the wide-ranging support from democratically elected representatives in Belgium and across the Western world, emphasizing solidarity as a crucial component in achieving a free and democratic Iran. Vandaag was ik te gast op het congres voor internationale vrouwendag van [#NCRI] [#IWD2024]. Vrouwen vormen de kern van het verzet tegen het Iraanse regime. Élk individu heeft recht op vrijheid, zelfbeschikking en democratie waar ze ook wonen. Daar zal ik voor blijven strijden 👊! [https://t.co/HNMW3JQvXy] — kathleen depoorter (@KDepoorterMP) [February 24, 2024] Candice Bergen, former Canadian Member of Parliament and Leader of Canada’s Conservative Party commended the strength and passion demonstrated by the NCRI President-elect and emphasized the unity between women and men in their shared pursuit of freedom, democracy, and human rights. Bergen praised Maryam Rajavi for her inclusive leadership style, which empowered women to take on significant roles within the movement. She said, “You have put these women in positions of leadership not just as tokens, not to check a box, not to fill a quota, but to provide real leadership, strong decision-making capabilities. You have said to these women, yes, you can, and I believe in you, and I’m going to mentor you.” Acknowledging the sacrifices made by Iranian women and girls on the ground, Bergen expressed deep admiration for their courage, resilience, and unwavering dedication to the cause of freedom. She called for solidarity and support for these brave individuals, emphasizing the importance of peace and protection for those risking everything to fight for a better future. While celebrating the achievements of women and the spirit of International Women’s Day, the former MP also issued a call to action. She urged women leaders to use their positions of influence to speak truth to power and challenge the policy of appeasement towards the Iranian regime. Mrs. Bergen emphasized the need for a united front against Tehran’s oppressive tactics, which have caused division, hostility, and violence on a global scale. Mrs. Bergen said, “I want to announce a recent statement that has been supported by 400 women, personalities who are many, many of them are here today, some have not been able to attend, but they are all with us in spirit. The signatories include former world leaders, ministers, and officials, Nobel laureates, UN rapporteurs, members of parliament, renowned journalists and authors, women experts in all fields of study in the academic world, heads of NGOs, imagine women, the impact that we can have in all of those places for freedom. These are the women who have signed this declaration. These female dignitaries are from over 40 countries, spanning five continents. At the forefront of this support is the condemnation of the Iranian’s regime, systematic repression of women.” For Ingrid Betancourt, the former Colombian Senator and presidential candidate, the significance of this event resonated deeply, as it falls on the heels of the anniversary of her own harrowing experience—22 years since her abduction by a guerrilla group in Colombia. She expressed profound honor in joining forces with the resistance movement against the patriarchal, oppressive, and misogynistic culture perpetuated by the Iranian regime. Mrs. Betancourt highlighted the transformation of Iranian women from mere protesters to formidable resistance fighters, underscoring their empowerment under the leadership of Maryam Rajavi. Reflecting on her longstanding association with Mrs. Rajavi, Betancourt acknowledged the initial skepticism and misinformation surrounding the resistance movement. However, her unwavering conviction in being in the right place at the right time, driven by the pursuit of truth, led her to witness firsthand the remarkable achievements and leadership of Maryam Rajavi. The former Colombian Senator said, “I have been subject to fake news, I have also been subject to many criticisms that I feel are unfair, but in this case, because I know who Myriam Rajavi is, it makes me even sicker because of the fake news they carry. I have seen her as a woman who is not above others, she is not above, she takes care, always takes care, all the time takes care of her colleagues.” Furthermore, Mrs. Betancourt applauded what she called “a cultural revolution fostered by Mrs. Rajavi,” emphasizing that it transcends gender divides and stands as a testament to collective empowerment against patriarchal norms. She stressed the importance of recognizing this movement not as a gender war but as a unified effort to challenge and dismantle oppressive structures. The former presidential candidate added, “The space for women has diminished. The only place where I feel it hasn’t diminished is here, in the PMOI, where I feel that women have not only been empowered, but men and women, all together, have embraced the opportunity they have to live this kind of leadership because they are opposing, confronting, and destroying a patriarchal behavior.” Dismissing the regime’s propaganda once again, Mrs. Betancourt said, “If this movement wasn’t important, why bother? But not only that. Recently, we’ve been informed of leaked messages from the Foreign Minister and intelligence inside Iran. There is a strategy to pay academics, scientists, people who normally feel neutral and objective, and say they’re unbiased, they’re paid by the regime to demonize the PMOI. Imagine the time consumed, the effort, and the energy they put into annihilating this resistance. That’s one of the reasons I’m so happy today. Because we’re here, after many years, we’ve gained momentum. I know we will be the generation that will applaud the downfall of the Mullah regime, and that women are the changemakers. Women are the ones who will overcome the regime.” Paris. International Conference on Women in Iran With Maryam Rajavi [#FreeIran2024] [#WomensRights] [#Iran] [pic.twitter.com/xVbTkBta5w] — Firouz Mahvi (@FirouzMahvi) [February 24, 2024] Irish Senator Erin McGreehan voiced her unwavering support for Iranian women and their struggle against oppression and tyranny. She also emphasized the extraordinary resilience of Iranian women who continue to defy repressive measures imposed by the authorities. Reflecting on the history of Iran’s anti-monarchy revolution, Senator McGreehan lamented the theft of democratic ideals by the current theocracy. However, she highlighted the pivotal role of women in championing a new democratic revolution, citing their unwavering commitment to freedom and democracy despite severe suppression. Senator McGreehan said, “During the last four decades and under the leadership of women, this culture of resistance has morphed and organized the resistance movement with the democratic opposition, the PMOI, and the wider coalition, the NCRI. And today you, Madam Rajavi, are continuing this proud tradition, inspiring a whole new generation of Iranian girls to actively take part and shape the future of their country in a free democratic republic. Indeed, your determination and your leadership are inspiring women all over the world. And with such inspiration and a beacon for a free and democratic Iran, women are now at the forefront of the protest movement and central to [ the Resistance Units](https://www.ncr-iran.org/en/news/iran-resistance/resistance-units-iran-societys-response-to-mullahs-rule-of-terror/) mobilizing and expanding all across Iran to break through the regime, suffocating oppression and their misogyny.” Rejecting calls for dialogue with the theocratic regime, Senator McGreehan underscored the futility of appeasement policies and called upon democratic countries to stand in solidarity with Iranian women in their quest for freedom and equality. In conclusion, Senator McGreehan expressed her unwavering support for Madam Rajavi and the Iranian women’s fight for a free and democratic republic based on the [Ten-Point Plan](https://www.ncr-iran.org/en/maryam-rajavis-ten-point-plan-for-future-iran/) for the future of Iran. She affirmed the solidarity of women worldwide and extended her heartfelt wishes for the people of Iran to realize their aspirations for a strong, free, and beautiful nation. In her remarks at the conference, former Afghan Minister Nargis Nehan described the dire situation in Afghanistan, where poverty is rampant, families are forced to sell their daughters, and the Taliban’s extremist ideology is indoctrinating young boys. She denounced the international community’s engagement with the Taliban and criticized the silence surrounding human rights violations. The former Minister emphasized the need for unity among Afghan and Iranian women to challenge gender apartheid and hold oppressive regimes accountable. She urged solidarity efforts to raise global awareness about the threats posed by extremism and terrorism emanating from Iran and Afghanistan. Mrs. Mehan said, “We really appreciate your presence today here as distinguished guests and we really appreciate that you are with us, with our sister in Iran, and I’m sure with your sisters in Afghanistan. But there is one harsh reality. Your governments, your ministries of defense, your ministries of finance, your ministry of finance affairs are not with us. They left us alone and they abandoned us in this fight.” In closing, former Minister Nehan called for women to take greater leadership roles in advocating for justice and reform on a global scale. She emphasized the importance of women’s empowerment and urged male allies to support women’s voices in the fight for equality and peace. The speech concluded with wishes for a Happy Women’s Day and a call to action for a better, more equitable world.

In her impassioned address, Mrs. Badi condemned repression, violence, and dictatorship, affirming the collective demand for dignity, freedom, and self-determination. She underscored the importance of women’s participation in decision-making processes and advocated for the empowerment of Iranian women as full citizens. Paying tribute to the Iranian Resistance efforts, she said, “I salute Mrs. Rajavi, whose words heal and transform into weapons of resistance that intimidate dictators. We will not relent; we will continue to wield words as weapons. These tools of resistance will persist until we reclaim our rights — our right to live with dignity, to choose freely, to return to our homelands. That’s why I say, wherever she may be, today’s fight is the same, and together we grow stronger. Lastly, let us never cease advocating for human rights in Iran and around the world. Long live the women of Iran!” Closing her speech, Mrs. Badi reiterated the unity of women’s struggles globally and pledged continued solidarity in the fight for human rights and gender equality. She expressed gratitude to all women who persevere in the struggle for justice, emphasizing their resilience and determination every day of the year and on International Women’s Day. In her speech, Leymah Roberta Gbowee, 2011 Nobel Peace Prize laureate and renowned Liberian peace activist, recounted the harrowing realities of war and violence in her homeland, where women and children endured unspeakable atrocities. Despite the bleak circumstances, she emphasized the transformative power of ordinary women uniting for change. Drawing parallels between Liberia’s struggle for peace and Iran’s quest for freedom, Mrs. Gbowee underscored the resilience and potential of Iranian women to effect positive change in their country. She highlighted the courage of Iranian women who have bravely protested against oppression, even in the face of imprisonment and persecution. The Nobel Peace Prize winner called upon Iranian women to harness their collective strength and unity in pursuit of peace, justice, and democracy. Emphasizing the importance of solidarity across religious and ideological divides, she urged women to work together towards a common goal of liberation. Reflecting on Liberia’s successful transition to democracy and the election of Africa’s first female president, Mrs. Gbowee emphasized the transformative impact of women’s leadership in shaping a peaceful society. She rallied Iranian women to stand firm in their quest for freedom and justice, reminding them that their resilience and determination would ultimately pave the way for a brighter future.

With over 40 years of exile, she noted the relentless pursuit of justice for the 30,000 Iranians murdered in 1988 and the ongoing fight for freedom for those remaining in Iran, particularly young girls deprived of education and forced into marriages. Mrs. Attias condemned the Iranian regime’s oppression and highlighted the voices of courageous women like Maryam Akbari Manfared and Azam Kholami Zahab, who have endured imprisonment and mistreatment for their commitment to justice and democracy. She denounced the UN’s hosting of Ebrahim Raisi, now President of Iran and implicated in past atrocities, and criticized Western leaders for engaging with him. Attias underscored the historical struggle of Iranian women against tyranny, from the constitutional revolution of 1906 to the present day, where women continue to fight for their rights and freedom. She said, “The Shah mistreated Iranian women to force them to uncover their heads. The Mullahs do the same to force them to cover up. An eternal and futile quest for men to assert their power over women.” She condemned the regime’s attempts to manipulate European countries and institutions through false accusations and urged European leaders to stand firm against such manipulation. In conclusion, Attias reaffirmed her unwavering support for Iranian women in their quest for freedom and justice. She echoed Mrs. Rajavi’s call for resistance and emphasized that Iranian women’s indomitable spirit will ultimately triumph over oppression. Linda Chavez, Chairman of the Center for Equal Opportunity, passionately rallied support for regime change in Iran, emphasizing the urgent need for transformative action. The former Director of the White House Office of Public Liaison lauded the leadership of Mrs. Maryam Rajavi, hailing her as one of the world’s most dynamic and inspiring leaders. She highlighted the dire situation faced by women in Iran, where systemic oppression and discrimination threaten their very lives. The former White House official said, “There will not be change in Iran without regime change. And this affects not just the women of Iran, not even the women and men of Iran. It affects the entire world.” Refuting attempts by agents who serve Tehran, Mrs. Chavez added, “If you listen to so-called experts, they’ll tell you that Iran is not really ready for regime change. They say maybe the people don’t want it bad enough and that there really isn’t an organized force that can bring about regime change. Well, apparently, they have never been to an NCRI meeting or see the members of the PMOI because they are ready on a second’s notice to be able to execute that kind of regime change.” Dismissing the regime’s propaganda against the Iranian Resistance, Mrs. Chavez said, “I think that it’s important to understand that if this movement were not a threat to the mullahs in Tehran, then why is it they spend so much money and effort and even violence to try to stop that movement?” Emphasizing the importance of Madam [Rajavi’s Ten-Point Plan](https://www.ncr-iran.org/en/maryam-rajavis-ten-point-plan-for-future-iran/), which advocates for the separation of church and state, equal rights for women and men, and free and fair elections, Mrs. Chavez expressed confidence in her ability to lead Iran toward a brighter future.

She emphasized the significance of March 8th, International Women’s Day, as a symbol of women’s freedom worldwide, underscoring the struggles faced by women in Iran under oppressive regimes and Islamic law. The former senator paid tribute to individuals like Mahsa Amini and Dr. Alejo Vidal Cuadra, former Vice President of the European Parliament, whom she said have fought for freedom and democracy despite facing severe opposition and even violence. She highlighted feminism as synonymous with social justice and freedom, stressing the importance of continued advocacy for the rights of Iranian women and men. Former Senator Quintanilla Barba concluded her address with a message of hope and solidarity, affirming her commitment to standing alongside Iranian women in their quest for freedom and justice. Her words encapsulated a spirit of resilience and determination, resonating with the shared aspirations for a better future for all.

Drawing attention to the tragic death of Masha Amini, who lost her life in custody after defying discriminatory laws enforced by the Morality Police, MP Liltorp emphasized the urgent need for justice in Iran. The parliamentarian from Denmark condemned the Iranian regime’s relentless crackdown on dissent and its flagrant disregard for basic human rights, particularly targeting women with violence, fear, and systemic misogyny. Despite facing unimaginable atrocities, Iranian women have exhibited remarkable courage and resilience in their quest for freedom and equality. Expressing personal resonance with the plight of Iranian women, MP Liltorp highlighted Denmark’s commitment to gender equality and emphasized the importance of standing up against oppression on the international stage. She underscored the need for decisive action by the European Union and other nations to hold the Iranian regime accountable for its egregious violations of human rights.

Drawing from her experience as President of the Law Society of England and Wales, Mrs. Blacklaws recalled issuing statements urging the international community to intervene and secure the rights of defenseless residents of Ashraf 3 in Iraq, who faced deadly attacks orchestrated by the Iranian government and the IRGC Quds Force. She underscored the continuation of these challenges even after the residents resettled in Albania, with Iran resorting to cyber-attacks to pressure the Albanian government to restrict their activities. Blacklaws condemned the judicial proceedings in Tehran against members of the PMOI and the NCRI, highlighting the Iranian government’s abuse of the judiciary to silence dissent and pro-democracy voices. She stressed the international community’s responsibility to intervene on behalf of those seeking justice and accountability, proposing mechanisms such as referral to the UN Security Council or the use of universal jurisdiction in democratic countries. Commending Mrs. [Rajavi’s Ten-Point Plan](https://www.ncr-iran.org/en/maryam-rajavis-ten-point-plan-for-future-iran/), she said, “This is a roadmap for success and a viable platform upon which the Iranian people can build a free, secular, and democratic Iran. It deserves all of our support and endorsement, so I urge the British and the European governments and the international community to join with the thousands who are already supporting this cause.” In her address, Ganna Yudkivska, a former Ukrainian judge at the European Court of Human Rights, emphasized the urgent need for global solidarity in supporting the rights of women in Iran. She highlighted the courage of Iranian women in the face of oppression, drawing parallels to her own experiences and insights gained from literature she had admired. Referencing her work with the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, Mrs. Yudkivska underscored the plight of Iranian women arbitrarily detained for their activism. She recounted the stories of several political prisoners, emphasizing their unwavering commitment to justice and freedom. Mrs. Yudkivska called for global attention to the struggles of these women, stating that their resilience embodies a critical movement challenging radicalism and extremism in the Middle East. She drew parallels to her own country’s fight against Russian aggression, asserting that the Iranian women’s struggle represents a broader quest for democracy and freedom. Italian MP Naike Gruppioni expressed solidarity with Iranian women in their struggle for democracy and freedom. She highlighted the oppressive nature of the Iranian theocratic dictatorship, describing it as marked by endemic misogyny and repression. Mrs. Gruppioni also emphasized the importance of women’s representation in institutions and civil society as a means to counter oppressive regimes and promote democratic principles. MP Gruppioni said, “The immense courage of Iranian women places them at the forefront of resistance—physical, ideological, and intellectual—unparalleled in the world. They are leading the charge in trying to change a theocratic and autocratic government. The immense courage of these women, who survive, fight, and resist violence, exclusions, discrimination, and the annihilation of individualities, already makes them citizens of a free and evolved world that must, at all costs, provide them with the political, institutional, and ideological support they deserve.” The Italian representative praised the leadership of Mrs. Rajavi, stating, “The President of the National Council of the Iranian Resistance is a woman like us, a courageous Iranian woman, and having known her, I would say the most courageous of all. Mrs. Rajavi is the embodiment of the strength of what women could have done if the cowardice of the regime had not feared it, had not stopped it, had not stifled it, and had not inhibited it!” MP Gruppioni called for concrete support for Iranian women and reaffirmed the commitment to stand alongside them in their quest for justice and equality.

Gunnarsdottir condemned the institutionalized discrimination and misogyny that Iranian women face, calling for an end to the oppressive regime and the establishment of democratic principles. She said, “Iranian women in the Resistance movement have been a real force for good. Like women everywhere, of course. But women in Iran, have made a lot of sacrifices during the recent struggle. Some have made the ultimate sacrifice far too many.” MP Gunnarsdottir added, “Maryam Rajavi has been a great leader of the Iranian opposition, a role model for all of us here. We look forward to the day when the opposition movement can move home, can move home to Iran, and institute [her Ten-points plan](https://www.ncr-iran.org/en/maryam-rajavis-ten-point-plan-for-future-iran/). And that will be a great day for all of us. But Mariam Rajavi has also a 12-point plan for gender equality in Iran.” The Icelandic representative underscored the importance of supporting progressive forces within Iran to bring about meaningful change and eliminate the legacy of oppression perpetuated by the current regime. Drawing from Iceland’s achievements in gender equality, MP Gunnarsdottir stressed the need to help Iranian women achieve fundamental rights, including the right to choose their clothing and spouses, equal participation in democratic processes, and freedom from discrimination.

Commending the courage of Iranian women, she said, “We are pleased that this movement is led by a courageous woman, full of strength, who is not afraid of the dictatorial and religious regime governing Iran. It is the moment of encounter where women from all over the world have shown courage and determination and are facing all challenges.” MP Dascalu added, “The revolt of Iranian women is not just about the struggle against the veils, but beyond that, it is about their desires and knowledge, their rights that have been stolen from them, and they are fighting to reclaim them.” She condemned Tehran’s actions on the international stage, labeling them as threats to humanity. Expressing solidarity, the MP declared the support of Moldova’s women for their Iranian counterparts, advocating for the respect of women’s rights and the condemnation of authoritarian regimes. She emphasized the importance of standing with those who continue to fight for dignity and equality, particularly in the face of oppression. Maltese MP Katya De Giovanni highlighted the importance of solidarity and the struggle for gender equality and justice, particularly in light of recent events in Iran. She emphasized the shocking human rights violations in Iran, including the execution of 25 women in 2023 and the escalation of chemical attacks on girls’ schools to suppress protests. In contrast, the representative discussed Malta’s progress in promoting women’s participation in various spheres, including government and academia. She acknowledged the challenges women still face, such as the lingering culture of gender roles, but noted the strides made since women were first allowed to vote in 1947. MP De Giovanni reaffirmed Malta’s solidarity with Iranian women in their struggle for equality, justice, and human rights, emphasizing the global importance of supporting women’s rights movements. Addressing the event, Maria Pancu, a Member of Parliament from Moldova, emphasized the unwavering support of Moldova for the Iranian people, echoing sentiments of unity and compassion. She also reminded Moldova’s commitment to aiding the people of Ukraine for the past two years, underscoring the nation’s dedication to assisting those in need. Despite being a small country, Moldova is recognized for its immense heart, which extends to encompass the struggles faced by Iranians, she stressed. MP Pancu conveyed a message of unwavering belief in the Iranian people’s ability to achieve victory and freedom, echoing sentiments of solidarity with women in Iran and across the globe. In her speech, Malgorzata Krzyzowska, Vice-President of the Foreign Committee of the Polish Supreme Bar Council, highlighted the institutionalized oppression of women in Iran, citing misogynistic laws that restrict their rights and perpetuate gender inequality. She pointed to examples such as mandatory hijab laws, child marriage regulations, gender segregation practices, and unequal inheritance laws. Mrs. Krzyzowska stressed that as long as Iran remains under a misogynistic regime, women’s rights will continue to be neglected, and violence against them will persist. She called on forward-thinking governments and human rights organizations to maintain pressure on the Iranian regime, holding it accountable for crimes against women. She endorsed Mrs. Maryam Rajavi’s plan for women’s rights in a future free Iran, emphasizing the urgent need for change. Concluding her speech, Krzyzowska underscored the importance of protecting children and mothers, urging solidarity with the Iranian people’s aspirations for universal human rights and freedoms. The legal community in Poland, she affirmed, stands in support of these fundamental aspirations. Former member of the French National Assembly, Michèle de Vaucouleurs, expressed unwavering solidarity with those advocating for a free and democratic Iran. Reflecting on her tenure as chair of the Parliamentary Committee for a Democratic Iran from 2017 to 2022, Mrs. de Vaucouleurs underscored the bellicose and irreformable nature of the current theocratic regime. She shared insights gained from engagements with specialists in Iranian affairs and interactions with members of the Iranian Resistance in France and Albania. The former MP recounted testimonies of survivors from Iranian prisons, highlighting the enduring demand for justice, especially regarding the 1988 massacre of political prisoners. She commended the courage of women who bravely confronted the oppressive regime’s misogynistic policies and criminal actions. Expressing solidarity with those committed to freedom, Mrs. de Vaucouleurs emphasized hope in the program championed by Mrs. Maryam Rajavi, envisioning a future Iran where state and religion are separate, elections are free, the death penalty is abolished, and peace prevails.",
