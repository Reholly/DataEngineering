    "text": "In the heart of Iraq, where the echoes of conflict still reverberate, a beacon of hope emerges. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) join forces to breathe life into a once-devastated village. Their mission? To pave the way from rubble to roads, turning debris into pathways of renewal.\nFrom Chaos to Construction: Al Mansuriya’s Tale\nThe village of Al Mansuriya, nestled within the Multaqa district, bore witness to the wrath of 2016—a year that scarred its landscape with destruction. Private homes crumbled, public infrastructure lay in ruins, and despair hung heavy in the air. But today, Al Mansuriya stands on the cusp of transformation.\nNearly 60,000 tonnes of debris, remnants of tragedy, were painstakingly reclaimed from Al Mansuriya. The community rallied, their commitment unwavering. 400 residents, fueled by a shared purpose, engaged in the arduous task of debris removal.\nUnder the banner of Employment for Public Works (EPW) schemes, they sorted, crushed, and recycled. Their hands labored not just to clear the wreckage but to rebuild—a testament to resilience.\nJapan’s Hand: A Bridge to Sustainability\nSupported by the benevolence of the Government of Japan, the Kirkuk debris recycling system now stands as a symbol of progress. Its wheels turn, not merely to process waste, but to forge a sustainable path. Amidst the remnants of conflict with Daesh, this handover marks a milestone—an investment in Iraq’s future.\nUNEP’s West Asia Regional Director, Sami Dimassi, speaks with conviction. He champions the cause of circularity—the art of retaining materials within our economic ecosystem. No longer mere debris, these remnants become opportunities. Opportunities for employment, for resource optimization, and for safeguarding our planet. Dimassi’s words echo through the windswept streets of Al Mansuriya.\nGiorgi Gigauri’s Dual Triumph\nAs the sun kisses the newly cleared roads, Giorgi Gigauri, IOM Iraq’s Chief of Mission, reflects. His voice carries the weight of responsibility and hope. “This project,” he declares, “is a double win.” The communities find solace in reconstruction, and local authorities inherit a legacy of sustainability. Circular principles guide their steps, ensuring that every stone laid is a promise kept.\nBut this tale transcends mere debris management. The project’s crowning glory? A 600-meter stretch of asphalt—the first road built using recycled materials. Kirkuk’s roads, once scarred by conflict, now bear witness to resilience.\nMaterial testing confirms compliance with Iraqi road standards. And the remaining stockpile of recycled aggregate—13,650 tonnes—holds the promise of rebuilding 80 percent of the village’s thoroughfares.\nBeyond Debris: A Blueprint for Iraq’s Future\nThis initiative reaches beyond Al Mansuriya. Mosul Municipality received its own debris recycling center in 2022. Routine construction waste now finds purpose, weaving circularity into Iraq’s fabric.\nAs the dust settles and asphalt gleams, we glimpse a nation rising—a nation that transforms rubble into roads, despair into determination, and conflict into hope.",
