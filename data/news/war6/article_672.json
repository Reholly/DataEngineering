    "text": "Watch the release trailer of Warhammer 40,000: Dakka Squadron\nWarhammer 40,000: Dakka Squadron has hit Nintendo’s eShop like a Blasty Dakka to a goblin command base! Right now, players can take the helm of an orc machine and, as one of their commanders, lead his boys to victory in this fast-paced, aerial shooter.\nHere, action is mixed with black humor of the real kind. But if you think it's going to be just funny, well... couldn't be more wrong. This is war, after all. A bloody battle between the player’s orc companions and vicious goblins.\nThis time, players will take the wheel of an airborne war machine as one of the orc commanders.\nThey will be able to choose from five available orc clans, each with their own unique bonuses, whether more defensive or offensive. As they say – \"whatever floats one's boat\".\nThere will be five different planets to conquer and both ground and air targets to defeat. One thing can be said for sure – there will be no time for boredom!\nThere will also be a range of different types of missions to complete – whether it's the defense of a specific strategic point or, instead, a fierce aerial dogfight. The missions will vary in length and difficulty and sometimes their objective may even change while the task is being carried out.\nAlso, Commanders should not forget to check the technical parameters of your machine during the battle! They have to remember that it too has limited endurance.\nAnd while we're on the subject of aircraft, let's get to the particularly fun part. After all, each of the airships will be completely customizable! Oh, and there will be many types of them available to choose from.\nSo how about it? Already have a favorite color for an ORC MACHINE UV DESTRUCTION?\nWarhammer 40,000: Dakka Squadron is available on the\nNintendo eShop.\nThe game is going to receive a patch, with optimization changes and UI upgrades soon. The information regarding the patch availability will be announced on the nearest possible date.\nIf you want to be up-to-date with RedDeer.Games projects, visit\nthe official website,\nFor more information, contact the PR representative:\nABOUT REDDEER.GAMES\nSince 2019, RedDeer.Games (RDG) is an independent developer and publisher of video games.
