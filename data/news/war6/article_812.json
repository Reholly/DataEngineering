    "text": "New Delhi: As the Russian invasion of Ukraine escalated in 2022, the United States began \\\"preparing rigorously\\\" for a possible nuclear strike by Moscow against Kyiv, which would have become the first nuclear attack since the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the US took place almost eighty years ago, CNN said in a report citing two senior administration officials. The report further stated that outreach and public statements from the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, helped in averting the crisis.The US was particularly worried that Moscow might use a tactical or battlefield nuclear weapon, the officials said. As a result of these fears, the US tried to seek the assistance of non-allies, including India, to prevent Russia from such an attack, the report said.“One of the things we did was not only message them directly but strongly urge, press, encourage other countries, to whom they might be more attentive, to do the same thing,\\\" the senior administration official was quoted as saying by the media outlet.The US senior administration officials said that the public statements from PM Modi, and others, helped in averting the crisis. “I think we believe showing the international community the concern about this, particularly the concern from key countries for Russia and the Global South, was also a helpful, persuasive factor and showed them what the cost of all this could be,\\\" the official said.The official said that after India ‘weighed in’, it must have had some effect on their thinking. The second senior administration official said, “I think the fact that we know China weighed in, India weighed in, others weighed in, may have had some effect on their thinking…I can’t demonstrate this positively, but I think that’s our assessment.”In the Russia-Ukraine conflict, India has continuously condemned civilian killings and urged for a peaceful resolution to the dispute. In a crucial statement last year, PM Modi told Russian President Putin that “this is not the era of war” on the sidelines of the SCO summit held in Uzbekistan.Between late summer and fall 2022, the National Security Council called for a series of meetings to set contingency plans in place “in the event of either a very clear indication that they were about to do something, attack with a nuclear weapon, or if they just did, how we would respond, how we would try to preempt it, or deter it,” the first senior administration official said.",
