    "text": "Since 1994 KURVE Wustrow is offering an annual \"International Training on Nonviolence in the Context of War and Armed Conflict\". The training is held in English and lead by three experienced trainers from three different continents. The 12-day basic course addresses staff and activists from peace initiatives, human rights groups and non-governmental organisations from all over the world.\nObjective\nThe training offers a comprehensive introduction into civil nonviolent conflict transformation. The participants develop a broad understanding of nonviolence. They will be encouraged in their awareness, attitude and competencies towards nonviolent action. They are able to apply the contents of the training in their private as well as work contexts, and are able to pass this on as multipliers.\nThe training supports the exchange between participants, in particular south-south-exchanges.\nContents and Methods\nThe training is a shared educational learning process which involves mostly participatory exercises that elicit learning from participantsâ€™ insights and experiences.\nIt can be demanding and at times stressful, as this methodology pushes participants to take extra steps and share from a personal as well as from a professional level. The trainers facilitate the learning process and model a nonviolent approach to learning.\nAt the core of the training are the following contents:\n- Conflict Transformation\n- Conflict Analysis Tools\n- Nonviolence and Nonviolent Action\n- Mediation\n- Dealing with the Past\n- Coping with Repression\n- Stress Debriefing and Trauma\n- Holistic Security\n- Anti-Bias,\n- Do No Harm\n- Role as Peace Worker\nThe participatory and experience-based training is focussed on the needs of the participants. The concrete contents and their scope will be decided with the participants at the start of the training. Exchange, reflection and practical exercises are paramount.\nhttps://www.kurvewustrow.org/en/training-nonviolence\n- Deadline: 10 March 2024 (for people with Visa) and 05 May 2024 (no Visa)\nFee informationFee for organisations: 3.600 Euro Fee for individuals: 2.400 Euro Reduced fee: 2.000 Euro\nThe course fee covers training material, vegetarian full board and lodging in the seminar house of KURVE Wustrow.\nHow to register\nhttps://kurvewustrow.civiservice.de/webform/application-form-for-international-training",
