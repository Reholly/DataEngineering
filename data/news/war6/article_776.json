    "title": "PM Narendra Modi Stopped War Between Russia and Ukraine, Claims BJP’s New Lok Sabha Election 2024 Ad Campaign (Watch Video)",
    "text": "In a new advertisement campaign for the upcoming Lok Sabha Elections 2024, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi played a crucial role in stopping the war between Russia and Ukraine. The claim was made in the context of the evacuation of over 22,500 Indian students from the conflict zone. The BJP ad campaign titled “Modi ka Parivar” shows how PM Narendra Modi stopped the Russia-Ukraine war and helped bring back Indians who were stranded in the war torn region. It remains to be seen how this claim will impact the party’s campaign in the run-up to the elections.
