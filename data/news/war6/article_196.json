    "text": "Add articles to your saved list and come back to them any time. One night, in 1941, a man who was to become a friend of mine flew out of England in a Halifax bomber across the North Sea to the Baltic port city of Kiel, where Grossadmiral Karl Dönitz’s Kriegsmarine was constructing a massive U-Boat bunker. The base was heavily defended and at 20,000 feet above the target, his plane was coned in searchlights and as the flak rose to meet them the crew could read their maps and see their instruments as if it were midday. My friend, Boz, was the co-pilot that night, functioning as a spare man, essentially – there to take over if the pilot was killed. He had no controls. Credit: Robin Cowcher The pilot was zigzagging viciously when the Halifax suddenly dropped a wing and stalled and began to dive hard for the Baltic Sea, icy air fluting through the cabin and the sea storming towards them at 480 km/h. The pilot had lost control of himself, and of the plane, and started calling “bale out”. “This was disconcerting,” Boz later admitted. He and the navigator looked at each other dubiously, both realising that the pilot “was in a mess” and that baling out over the Baltic in winter would be a certain and appalling end. Boz loved aircraft, and he knew this one was alive. So he leaned across and backed off all four throttles and the engines caught and the plane came out of its dive and levelled at 11,000 feet, disaster averted. Once the plane had turned for home, the pilot got his head back and began talking to the crew on the intercom, but there was no answer from the rear gunner. The wireless operator went back to check on him and announced: “He’s gone, I’m afraid.” He had followed orders and baled out over the night sea and was never seen again. On the way home to England, the crew talked about their near miss and agreed with the pilot that what he had shouted over the intercom was “prepare to bale out”. A normal command in such circumstances. It’s likely none of the crew looked each other in the eye after landing in England at dawn. A secret of that sort is like an unexploded shell, in that certain careful protocols must creep into your dealings with it. I think the crew made a good, brave decision. Despite our regard for the dead, and our need to honour them for our own sake, they don’t need us as the living do. The dead don’t face tomorrows made heavy by ugly yesterdays. Boz never told this story publicly until long after the war, when the names of the rear gunner and the pilot were lost, and they couldn’t be linked in death by those who weren’t there, and who thus had easy access to blame. Those who weren’t there – with their judicial omniscience and their lordly, well-mulled pontifications – those riders in the stand. Those who were there know that those who weren’t there weren’t there. And never the twain shall meet. The pilot became a Wing Commander of a squadron and made it back to Melbourne after the war. Boz tried to contact him, without success. The Wing Commander perhaps thought there’d be some mention of the incident over Kiel, their little secret – that dutiful rear gunner. He couldn’t have known Boz too well. Boz was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and mentioned in dispatches twice and was flying with the 380th Bombardment Group for the United States Air Force against the Japanese when that group was awarded the United States Presidential Citation. The title “hero” is often dubiously applied, mostly in histories and comic books, but as teens we breathed the word behind Boz’s back. As schoolboys in his charge, my mates and I would try and get him to talk of his war and he’d snarl and swear at us, then point out a plover or a thundercloud or an untucked shirt by way of diversion. There was so much to admire about the man. And with the years, I’ve come to fully appreciate his willingness to assent to that white lie formulated high above the North Sea – his quick ability to see and accept the frailties and failures that inhabit and inhibit us all. He acted in loco parentis over my friends and me for some years, and saw and accepted a multitude of ours. Boz died a few weeks ago at the age of 105. We can now safely call him hero.",
