    "text": "President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said thanks to the sacrifices of martyrs, Egypt managed to enjoy peace and security despite unstable regional conditions.\nHe made the remarks during the 39th Armed Forces Cultural Symposium on the occasion of the the Armed Forces’ celebration of the Martyr’s Day, which is held at Al-Manara International Conference Center in New Cairo Saturday 09/03/2024.\nSisi noted that Egypt waged a 10-year war against terrorism and confronted extremist through that aimed at subverting the state.\nPresident Sisi said that Egypt lived in a major crisis for four years since the start of coronavirus, the Russian military operation in Ukraine and the war in Gaza.\nSisi pointed out to the increase in prices in the past year, adding that this requires exerting more efforts and working.\nPresident Sisi said that his promises to the Egyptians did not change, adding that with work and patience the country can overcome the current circumstances.\nHe asserted the importance of siding together and exerting more efforts to overcome the repercussions witnessed in the region and the world.\nSisi said that Egypt is helping to solve the crises as much as possible, adding that it tries to bring about peace and stability in the region.\nEgypt is keen on keeping the crossing open for 24 hours to allow aid supplies to the Gaza Strip whenever possible, he said.\nThe airdropping of aid supplies is due to the challenges facing their access into the enclave, especially the north, Sisi said.\nPresident Sisi dismissed as groundless allegations that some officials in the state control an amount of 10-12 billion dollars.\nThe population is living on 10 percent to 12 percent of the total area of Egypt instead of 6 percent previously, he said, adding that there was overpopulation from Aswan to Alexandria.\nThe state selected the hard way to become a “capable state”, he said.\nPresident Sisi pointed out to the challenges Egypt witnessed in the past ten years, adding that he was sure that the problem would be solved.\nSisi said that some institutions assessed the cost needed for the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip by an amount exceeding 90 billion dollars.",
