    "text": "QUETTA: Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir has said that armed forces and law enforcement agencies will fully support the people of Balochistan for peace and prosperity in the province as the success of Balochistan is the success of Pakistan. According to a statement issued here on Friday by Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR), the military’s media wing, Gen Munir said: “The people of Pakistan are proud of the brave people of Balochistan who have stood tall against all odds”. The COAS said this during his visit to the Awaran district of Balochistan where he was briefed on the security situation of the province. Gen Munir was informed about the efforts being made by the army in the socio-economic development and agriculture potential of Balochistan. “Armed Forces of Pakistan and law-enforcement agencies will continue to render their services in support of the people of Balochistan for peace and prosperity,” the general said. During the visit, the army chief interacted with the local elders, farmers and families of martyrs and assured them of the army’s unstinting support for their security and welfare while paying rich tribute to the sacrifices rendered by martyrs. The ISPR said that while interacting with the notables and farmers of Awaran, the army chief emphasised the importance of agriculture and the army’s commitment to the Green Pakistan Initiative. “Farmers will be provided with all kinds of agricultural facilities, including provision of easy agricultural loans, seeds, fertilisers, solar tube-wells and guidance by agriculture experts so that they can cultivate their lands and become partners in the progress and development of Pakistan,” Gen Munir said. Later on, the army chief inaugurated the Cadet College of Awaran and interacted with faculty members and students. He also appreciated the establishment of another Cadet College in Balochistan for the people of the area. Published in Dawn, March 9th, 2024",
