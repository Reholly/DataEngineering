    "text": "Young Survivor Displays Resilience, Transformation, and Gratitude to ICC 03/08/2024 Kenya (International Christian Concern) — Rebekah is a Kenyan victim and survivor of a terrorist attack that occurred three years ago in Katito, Kisumu County. The incident was perpetrated by a neighbor who was associated with the al-Shabab terrorists, although young Rebekah and her family were unaware of his affiliation. The family was sitting outside after dinner when the attack occurred. Their unsuspecting neighbor stopped by, seemingly with good intentions, and to chat. Rebekah’s family warmly welcomed him. To their shock, however, the neighbor carried and detonated a bomb. Rebekah’s parents and the terrorist were killed instantly. Rebekah sustained severe injuries, including losing three fingers, yet miraculously survived. Rebekah underwent a drastic transformation after the horrific incident. Without family support, she spent two years in an orphanage before returning to live with her sister-in-law. She struggled with simple household chores because of her injuries. And memories of the incident haunted her. However, Rebekah has been resilient and displayed an unwavering zeal to improve. She is also doing well in school. “Rebekah is a disciplined and dedicated student and has shown remarkable improvement in both writing and speaking English,” said her eighth-grade teacher. “She actively participates in class, asking questions and completing assignments with enthusiasm. I’ve formed a close bond with Rebekah, helping whenever she faces challenges. The use of effective and sufficient learning materials has proven beneficial, especially given Rebekah’s need for extensive writing practice. To further support her academic progress, I’ve decided to allocate special time for private tutoring, ensuring a focused and personalized learning experience. This initiative includes scheduling sessions and communicating the plan with her guardians.” Rebekah’s sister-in-law expressed immense admiration for Rebekah’s resilient spirit and praised her growing circle of friends, particularly her close bond with schoolmates. She shared, “Rebekah now has a multitude of friends, fostering even closer connections with her schoolmates. It’s heartwarming to see her friends visiting our home, creating a lively atmosphere with numerous children playing together.” She also expressed gratitude to International Christian Concern (ICC) which supplied Rebekah with school supplies and other support. “It has significantly lightened the parental load for me. Rebekah’s academic journey has been smooth, with her never lacking any essentials. A heartfelt thank you for ensuring she has the necessary school supplies, clothes, and even food for her stay-at-home. We are genuinely happy and deeply grateful for this support.” Brimming with joy and adorned with countless smiles, Rebekah enthusiastically expressed, “I feel immense happiness when I have an ample supply of books at school. Not too long ago, my collection was insufficient, and most of the books were in poor condition. However, ever since International Christian Concern began providing me with books, even my left-handed writing practice has become easier. As we converse, I am thoroughly savoring every moment at school and grateful for the positive impact ICC has on my education.” Reflecting on Rebekah’s journey as a young girl, it becomes clear that she has embraced a positive perspective on life, showing considerable progress. With unwavering determination, she nurtures dreams of joining a boarding high school and achieving her long-term goals.",
