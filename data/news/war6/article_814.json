    "text": "Upon instructions by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez has extended financial aid to the families of six soldiers who perished and six others who were wounded during clashes with the terrorist group Dawlah Islamiyah-Maute in Lanao del Norte last Feb. 18.\nACT-CIS party-list Rep. Erwin Tulfo said over P4.14 million in financial, education and livelihood assistance from the Speaker’s personal calamity and emergency funds were given to the families of the 12 troopers who figured in the skirmishes with the Maute Group from last week of February until March.\nThe Department of Social Welfare and Development, along with the Department of Labor and Employment and the Commission on Higher Education were also set to provide livelihood and educational assistance to the victims and their families, Tulfo said.\nRomualdez said the President directed him to provide financial aid to the families of Cpls. Rey Anthony Salvador, Reland Tapinit, and Rodel Mobida, as well as PFC. Arnel Tornito, and Pvts. Micharl John Lumingkit and James Porras who died during the clashes with extremists.\nOthers who likewise received the subsidies were Cpls. Jaymark Remotigue, Rey Mark Limare, and Ernil Quiñones, PFC Marvien Aguipo, Pvts. Amiril Sakinal and Nazareno Provido. The extremist group clashed with the soldiers from the 44th Infantry Battalion in Barangay Ramain, Munai town in Lanao del Norte.\nFor the families of the six fallen soldiers, an aid package worth P400,000 to P430,000 was granted, consisting of P300,000 in cash aid, P30,000 in schooling aid for each child, and P100,000 in livelihood assistance.\nThe six wounded soldiers received P150,000 in cash aid, P30,000 in schooling aid for each child, and P100,000 in livelihood assistance.",
