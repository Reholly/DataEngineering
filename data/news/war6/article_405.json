    "text": "The Sela Tunnel, a vital infrastructure project connecting Guwahati in Assam to Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh, was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday. Strategic importance of Sela TunnelConstructed by the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) at a cost of â‚¹825 crore, the tunnel holds strategic importance, providing year-round connectivity and significantly reducing travel time in the challenging terrain.Located at an altitude of 13,700 feet in the West Kameng district, the Sela Tunnel offers a lifeline for the region, especially the strategic Tawang area where Indian and Chinese troops clashed in December 2022. The road to Tawang, passing through the treacherous Sela mountain pass, posed severe challenges with temperatures dropping to -20 degrees Celsius and heavy snowfall obstructing passage.World's longest twin-lane tunnel at an altitudeThe completed project is recognised as the world's longest twin-lane tunnel built at an altitude exceeding 13,000 feet. Comprising Tunnel 1 (a 980m single tube tunnel) and Tunnel 2 (a 1555m twin tube tunnel), the latter includes one bi-lane tube for traffic and an escape tube for emergencies. The tunnel system is complemented by a seven-kilometer approach road to Tunnel 1 and a 1.3-kilometer link road connecting Tunnel 1 to Tunnel 2.Described as an engineering marvel, the Sela Tunnel incorporates the new Austrian Tunnelling Method and adheres to the highest safety standards. The project aims to provide a faster and more efficient transport route, holding strategic significance for the country.The lack of motorable roads and rail connections in Arunachal Pradesh has been considered a disadvantage for India compared to China along the border in the northeast. The completion of the Sela Tunnel addresses this gap, ensuring all-weather connectivity to the Tawang region, a part contested by China.The Sela Tunnel holds historical importance, as during the 1962 war, Indian and Chinese forces clashed, resulting in the PLA overtaking Tawang town. The new infrastructure aims to enhance military preparedness by allowing seamless movement for personnel and equipment throughout the year.The recent order for Zorawar light tanks underscores the strategic significance of the Sela Tunnel, offering faster deployment along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), where the challenging terrain makes the use of main battle tanks like T-90, T-72, and Arjun impractical.Despite facing challenges during construction, including a major cloudburst in July that rendered approach roads inaccessible, the Sela Tunnel is ready for inauguration after a thorough third-party audit post the Silkyara tunnel cave-in in Uttarakhand last November.",
