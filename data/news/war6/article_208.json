    "text": "Textron (NYSE:\nTXT) +1.8% pre-market Friday after the U.S. military said it will resume flights using the Osprey aircraft, The Wall Street Journal reported, months after the entire fleet was grounded indefinitely over a series of deadly crashes.\nA joint venture between Boeing (\nBA) and Textron ( TXT) has built more than 450 Osprey aircraft, which has a tilt-rotor design that allows it to take off and land vertically like a helicopter and fly forward like an airplane.\nBut the Osprey has been involved in accidents that have killed at least 60 U.S. service members and passengers since entering service in 2007, leading to concerns over its safety and design.\nThe planes were grounded in December following a fatal crash off the coast of Japan that killed eight U.S. service members; Japan also grounded its Osprey fleet after the November 29 accident.\nThe U.S. Navy and the Japanese Army said in a joint statement Friday that the grounding has been lifted following a thorough safety review of the incident, and maintenance and procedural changes have been implemented.",
