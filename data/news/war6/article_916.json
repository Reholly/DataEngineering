HEADLINES : Sand not from the beachfront Do not question Sabah’s sovereignty in Malaysia: CM We must be like Sarawak: DCM Aerial water bombing to tackle wildfires ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Home / Sports News Cavaliers dethrone Borneo Eagles Published on: Monday, March 11, 2024 By: Winnie Kasmir Text Size: New Zealand Cavaliers (top) won the men’s category while Borneo Flyers defended their title in the women’s category. SANDAKAN: New Zealand Cavaliers emerged champions of the Borneo Sevens 2024 tournament that was held at the Eagles Rugby Club here on Sunday. The final was a nail-biting affair pitting the Cavaliers against the defending champions Borneo Eagles. ADVERTISEMENT When the referee blew the final whistle, the Cavaliers emerged triumphant having scored 19 points to Borneo Eagles’ 12 points. At half time, both teams were tied at 12 points each. Players from both teams were well-matched in skill and speed and the Cavaliers found themselves under early pressure when Borneo Eagles scored their first try in the first minute after the kick-off.

Read more The Cavaliers responded and scored two tries after that with one conversion. They found their momentum in the second half and scored another try which was converted. ADVERTISEMENT Cavaliers captain Lewis Ormond commenting on the win said the Borneo Eagles are a good team and that they are very happy to have participated in the tournament. “We will definitely come back next year to defend our title and it is an experience for some of our boys who have never travelled abroad. ADVERTISEMENT “They are happy to experience a new culture,” he said, and hope that more children in the state and Malaysia will take up rugby. Rugby he said, is not only about on the field as the experience off the field also plays an important part in the game. “Meeting new people and getting new experiences is part of that,” he said. In the women’s category, Borneo Flyers defended the championship title after crushing Uzbekistan 40-0 in the final. Flyers captain Dhys Faleafaga said she is super proud of the squad as they all worked very hard to defend the title. “They made my job as a captain very easy as they are really good. I see so much potential here and I told them that I believe that they know how to play good rugby as they have good skills,” she said. As champions in both the men’s and women’s categories of Borneo Sevens 2024, New Zealand Cavaliers and Borneo Flyers won the Challenge trophy and US$5,000 cash respectively. The runners-up of both categories received US$2,000 cash. Minister of Youth and Sports, Hannah Yeoh presented the prizes to the winners. Stay up-to-date by following Daily Express’s Telegram channel.
