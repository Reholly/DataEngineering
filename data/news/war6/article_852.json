    "text": "2024-03-10 14:40:49 The US Army announced, on Sunday, the implementation of a new joint operation to deliver humanitarian aid to the besieged Gaza Strip in light of the continuation of the war since last October, with its residents suffering from a severe humanitarian crisis. The US Central Command (Centcom) said in a statement published on the “. She added, “The aid provided included meals provided by Jordan and a US Air Force C-130 plane, which included more than 11,500 meals in addition to other food items, including rice, flour, pasta, and canned food, providing life-saving humanitarian assistance in northern Gaza.” “. The command said that airdrops of aid contribute to alleviating human suffering, and that they will continue. Data from the US Department of Defense (Pentagon) showed that the United States dropped about 135,000 meals in air drops this month, according to what Reuters reported. For its part, the Jordanian army announced the implementation of 6 airdrops on Sunday, in cooperation with “sisterly and friendly countries.” He mentioned [ statement](https://www.petra.gov.jo/Include/InnerPage.jsp?ID=274115&lang=ar&name=news&cat=news) The army, which was published by the Jordanian News Agency (Petra): “Two C130 aircraft belonging to the Royal Jordanian Air Force, a plane belonging to the Arab Republic of Egypt, a plane belonging to the United States of America, a plane belonging to the Republic of France, and a plane belonging to the State of Belgium participated in the operation.” The statement indicated that “the number of airdrops carried out by the Jordanian Armed Forces since the beginning of the Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip rose to 37 Jordanian airdrops, and 40 airdrops in cooperation with brotherly and friendly countries.” After 5 months of war and a severe siege on the Gaza Strip, the vast majority of the Palestinian Strip’s population of 2.3 million people are vulnerable to famine, according to the United Nations.

Watch the moment the Imbaba church fire broke out](https://www.archyde.com/the-first-video-from-the-inside-watch-the-moment-the-imbaba-church-fire-broke-out/) The transfer of humanitarian aid to Gaza across the land borders (from Rafah to the south and from the Kerem Shalom crossing with Israel) has declined, and relief organizations attribute this to Israeli restrictions. United Nations agencies say that malnutrition rates among children in northern Gaza are “very high” and about three times higher than in the southern Palestinian Strip, where more aid is available. US President Joe Biden ordered the army to build a temporary port to bring aid into Gaza by sea. The Pentagon said on Friday that it could take up to 60 days to build the port and become operational, a period of time that aid groups say is too long given the imminent risk of famine. 1710094230 #Army #announces #airdrops #Gaza #Strip Related posts: [This is how Griezmann left Atlético without a single shot on goal against Inter and frustrated Simeo...](https://www.archyde.com/this-is-how-griezmann-left-atletico-without-a-single-shot-on-goal-against-inter-and-frustrated-simeones-plan-soccer-sports-3/) [U-turn in Ecuador: journalist replaces murdered candidate - Ecuador](https://www.archyde.com/u-turn-in-ecuador-journalist-replaces-murdered-candidate-ecuador/) [Former Italian President Giorgio Napolitano Dies at 98: A Legacy of Leadership and Reform](https://www.archyde.com/former-italian-president-giorgio-napolitano-dies-at-98-a-legacy-of-leadership-and-reform/) [St. Petersburg cafe bombing kills Russian military blogger](https://www.archyde.com/st-petersburg-cafe-bombing-kills-russian-military-blogger/) [Israeli Political Crisis: Statements and Repercussions on US Relations, Two-State Solution, and Dome...](https://www.archyde.com/israeli-political-crisis-statements-and-repercussions-on-us-relations-two-state-solution-and-domestic-public-opinion-latest-updates/) [Pinkelnig jumps to second place at the World Cup in Ljubno - winter sports](https://www.archyde.com/pinkelnig-jumps-to-second-place-at-the-world-cup-in-ljubno-winter-sports/) [Lots of love: real singer Kim Frank about the beginning, success and end of the teen band - streamin...](https://www.archyde.com/lots-of-love-real-singer-kim-frank-about-the-beginning-success-and-end-of-the-teen-band-streaming-tv/) [\"I suffer because he is so strong!\"](https://www.archyde.com/i-suffer-because-he-is-so-strong/)",
