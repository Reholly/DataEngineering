    "text": "Macron states ‘unwavering support’ for Moldova Paris – French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday stated his country’s “unwavering support” for Moldova as tensions mount between Chisinau and pro-Russian separatists. “France restates its unwavering support for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova within its internationally recognised borders,” he said in a joint statement with Moldovan President Maia Sandu as she visited Paris. Two years into Russia’s invasion of neighbouring Ukraine, Moldova faces “multiple challenges caused by the conflict on its borders”, the statement said. Top of the list is the pro-Russian breakway region of Transnistria, where officials last week appealed to Moscow for “protection”. There is mounting concern that the territory could become a new flashpoint in the conflict, with Moldova “facing intensifying hybrid attacks”, the two presidents said. Thursday’s meeting between Macron and Sandu will include the signature of a Chisinau-Paris defence deal, as well as an “economic roadmap”. “The Moldovan state must be in a position to protect its neutrality, defend its territory and its population, and contribute to regional and international security,” they said in their statement. Macron and Sandu said Paris was “fully backing” Moldova’s reforms aimed at one day joining the European Union, ahead of a referendum there later this year. “Justice reform and the battle against corruption” would be particularly important to a successful membership bid, they added.",
