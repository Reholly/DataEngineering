    "text": "Ace Ukrainian FPV drone pilot, Darwin, shows war’s explosive evolution At 21 years old, \"Darwin,\" is an ace pilot of first-person view (FPV) kamikaze drones with Ukraines Achilles battalion of the 92nd Brigade. Darwin hunts Russian targets, including tanks, armored personnel carriers and individual soldiers. FPV pilots like Darwin represent the evolution of Ukraines war against Russia. As artillery shells and rockets run short, Ukraines military increasingly turns to FPV drones to help hold back the enemys renewed offensive, degrade Russian President Vladimir Putin's war machine and strike fear in the enemy. Scripps News international correspondent Jason Bellini got rare access, for over 20 hours, to Darwin and his team. They spent most of their time at a secret location just a few miles from one of the most hotly-contested sectors of the front line. Alexander Kamyshin, Ukraines minister of strategic industries, told Scripps News that FPV drones are becoming the main battle weapon for our people. Thats why he is leading an FPV drone production initiative that aims to produce more than a million units for pilots by the end of this year.

He expects the price tag for killing an individual enemy fighter to drop to around $1,000 by the end of 2024. Kamyshin also noted that artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies will be integrated this year into his made-in-Ukraine FPV project. The hope is that AI will give FPV drones a technological advantage, making them less vulnerable to Russias counter-drone measures, which are constantly improving. An upcoming episode of Scripps News documentary series, In Real Life, will focus on the first-person experiences of Darwin,also known as the kamikaze kid.
