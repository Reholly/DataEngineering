    "text": "name=\"articleBody\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"> Hundreds of people gathered in London on Sunday to sound the shofar, the ram's horn used in the Jewish religion, to demand the release of Israeli hostages still held in Gaza.\nIn several places in the British capital, participants sounded their instruments at midday for 1 minute and 55 seconds, corresponding to the 155 days of captivity of the hostages, kidnapped in the deadly attack by Hamas, a terrorist movement based in Gaza, from October 7 in southern Israel.\nAt least 1,160 people were killed, most of them civilians, according to an AFP count established from official sources, and around 250 people kidnapped, 130 of whom are still being held in Gaza, according to Israeli authorities.\nIn retaliation, Israel launched a military offensive on Palestinian territory, which left more than 31,000 dead, according to leaders of the Islamist group, and 1.7 million displaced according to the UN.\nAlso read: Hamas “endeavours to inflame the region during Ramadan”, accuses Israel\n“The shofar produces a famous, recognizable moan.\nIt is used in moments of lament, of introspection.\nBut it also aims to wake us up, to encourage us to improve,”\nMarcel Knobil, organizer of these gatherings, and present in front of a London synagogue, told AFP.\n“It is so important that we come together and amplify the message that peace is all we want, and that as soon as the hostages are freed, as soon as Hamas lays down their arms, there will be peace.\n” he added.\n“I think that a day like today, when we see the entire world Jewish community coming together to pray for the release of the hostages, to remind the world of their terrible fate, is extremely precious for the families of the hostages themselves- same\n,” also declared Keith Black, head of the\nJewish Leadership Council\n.\nThis gathering takes place as negotiations struggle to reach a truce agreement on the eve of the start of Ramadan that would allow the release of hostages and the entry of more humanitarian aid into Gaza.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is facing intense pressure from Israeli public opinion who are demanding such an agreement in order to bring back to Israel the hostages still held in Gaza.",
