    "text": "People have been rioting all over the world. Likewise, at the UN, the vast majority of countries asked for a ceasefire; that is very significant, but unfortunately, the United States imposed its veto on the Security Council, Sepulveda Allende told Prensa Latina. The internationalist doctor described as a milestone South Africa’s decision to file a lawsuit in the International Court of Justice in The Hague, against Israel, who is being accused of the massacre against Palestinians. According to the latest count of the Ministry of Health in Gaza, the death toll since the onset of Tel Aviv’s military offensive amounts to over 30,900, and the injured exceeds 72,000 persons, in addition to the fact that almost 8,000 bodies are missing under the rubble. Sepulveda Allende welcomed the Chilean Government’s decision to cut off Israeli military companies’ participation in the International Air and Space Fair (FIDAE), scheduled to take place here next April. Allende’s grandson further praised the visit paid to that nation by Aleida Guevara, Commander Che’s daughter, and Nkosi Zwelivelile Mandela, grandson of former South African President Nelson Mandela, as ambassadors of the Global Campaign for the Right to Return to Palestine. Chile shelters the largest Palestinian community outside the Middle East; therefore, it is paramount to be here to make visible both Gazans’ cause and the ongoing genocide that is being committed, Allende’s grandson said. jrr/omr/mem/car",
