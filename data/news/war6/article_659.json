    "text": "The first flight was made by a Swedish reconnaissance aircraft Gulfstream S102B. It flew over Poland near the borders of the Kaliningrad region and Belarus. There is a variety of equipment on board the aircraft that can intercept and analyze messages and other electronic signals.\nThe second flight was carried out by a Saab 340 AEW&C radar aircraft over the Baltic Sea. The Saab 340 AEW&C aircraft has a radar system capable of detecting various targets over long distances.\nSweden’s entry into NATO On Thursday, March 7, Sweden officially became the 32nd member of NATO. The protocol on the country’s accession to NATO was published on the website of the US State Department.\nAfter the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, Sweden and Finland jointly submitted applications to join NATO. Thus, the countries abandoned the policy of military neutrality that both had observed for decades.\nAnd if for the latter it was relatively quick (Finland became the 31st NATO member on April 4, 2023), then for Sweden this process was delayed due to comments from Turkey and Hungary.\nLater, after a series of agreements, Ankara finally gave its consent. On January 25, 2023, Turkish President Recep Erdogan signed a decision of the Turkish parliament ratifying the protocol on Sweden’s accession to NATO.\nAfter which Hungary became the last NATO member country to delay ratifying Sweden’s membership in the Alliance. I only raised the issue almost a year later. Hungary recently took a reciprocal step by finally ratifying Stockholm’s application.\nRead urgent and important messages about Russia’s war against Ukraine on the channel RBC-Ukraine on Telegram .\n2024-03-09 20:43:40\n#Historical #mission #Swedish #planes #flew #Russia #time #joining #NATO",
