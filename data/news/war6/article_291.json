    "text": "Maguindanao del Norte, Philippines — From being adversaries, soldiers and combatants of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) are now allies in ensuring the success of the peace process in Mindanao as members of the joint peace and security committee (JPSC).\nAt a recent interview held at the JPSC office in Barangay Datu Odin Sinsuat in this province, retired Maj. Gen. Francisco Felicidario III of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and Von Al Haq of the MILF provided their perspectives on the progress of the peace process in Mindanao.\n“It’s no longer Mindanao at war. It’s a Mindanao in progress and development,” Al Haq said.\nHe noted the shift in discussions from confict to peace in the area.\nAl Haq cited the equitable distribution of peace dividends among various sectors due to the positive impact of peace negotiations.\nHe highlighted the role of the JSPC in maintaining peace and order as a product of peace negotiations.\nFelicidario cited significant improvements in security and mobility compared to previous years.\n“We’re getting there. We’re seeing a lot different from before this,” he said. ”You wouldn’t be here if we were in those times.”\nFelicidario stressed the need to sustain the gains of the peace process, citing the collective responsibility of stakeholders in securing lasting peace.\nHe mentioned ongoing discussions in the security cluster of the government discouraging the use of “conflict-affected areas.”\n“They would want to erase the term ‘conflict-affected areas’ and be more representative of the peace that everybody is enjoying now and the development that’s being enjoyed,” Felicidario said.\nThe JPSC is composed of 15 members of the Bangsamoro Islamic Armed Forces (BIAF), eight from the Philippine National Police and seven from the AFP. The committee was established since the start of the peace negotiations in the Bangsamoro region in 2019.\nIt has also continued its efforts as first responders to emergencies.\nAlmish Guimba, a former BIAF staff member, noted the transformative impact of peace negotiations on his family’s life, including opportunities for education and growth of former MILF combatants.",
