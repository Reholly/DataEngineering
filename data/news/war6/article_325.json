    "text": "Patricia is a champion for peace in supporting a permanent ceasefire in Gaza\nFormer Assemblywoman Sadaf Jaffer re-affirms her support for\nCampos-Medina for U.S. Senate at Somerset Democratic Convention\nCalifon, N.J.— Former Assemblywoman Sadaf Jaffer, a respected leader recognized as a distinguished American elected official who represented the 16th Legislative District in the New Jersey General Assembly, officially nominated U.S. Senate candidate Dr. Patricia Campos-Medina for the Somerset County Democratic Convention yesterday.\nIn a powerful statement, Jaffer expressed her unwavering support for Campos-Medina’s candidacy, emphasizing her moral leadership and extensive experience.\n“Patricia Campos-Medina is a principled and effective leader with a lifetime of experience that our government desperately needs,” stated Jaffer. “Her advocacy for workers’ rights, including domestic workers, and her commitment to women representation as the former head of Latina Civic, highlight her dedication to fairness and equality.”\nJaffer also commended Campos-Medina’s efforts in championing healthcare access, reproductive rights, and Medicare for all. “Patricia’s unwavering dedication to these critical issues demonstrates her understanding of the urgent challenges we face as a society,” added Jaffer.\nHighlighting Campos-Medina’s advocacy for peace, Jaffer emphasized the importance of her perspective, having lived through war as a child. “In a time where our leaders have remained silent on the devastating consequences of warfare, Patricia’s call for peace is more crucial than ever,” said Jaffer.\nJaffer urged voters to consider the significance of their choice, emphasizing the profound impact of U.S. Senators’ decisions on millions of lives worldwide. “The American people deserve a representative like Patricia Campos-Medina in the U.S. Senate,” concluded Jaffer.\nNJ party conventions in New Jersey are an insider’s political game. However, amidst this climate, individuals like Former Asw. Jaffer serves as a beacon of hope. She reminds us of the critical importance of speaking truth to power, even when those in power attempt to silence opposition.\nCampos-Medina’s campaign is based on issues and speaks directly to the concerns of NJ working class and regular voters. In her quest to win the nomination, she will continue to participate in Democratic conventions where she is invited to participate and speak to delegates. Her commitment is to the voters of NJ and she continues to build a grassroots campaign in areas where conventions are not fair or open to all candidates vying for the U.S. Senate.\n“My campaign is based on advancing policy issues based on my life experience. I am the daughter of a working class immigrant family; in the U.S. Senate I will drive solutions to working families issues as I have done my entire professional life,” states Campos-Medina. “I appreciate former Assemblywoman Sadaf Jaffer’s courageous support for my candidacy. She is a mentor and a role model for women of color who are running for office and fighting for representation.”\nWith over 20 years of experience in government service and Democratic Party support, Jaffer stressed the need for fresh leadership in the U.S. Senate. “We don’t need more of the same in the U.S. Senate,” affirmed Jaffer. “Patricia’s potential as the second Latina and first woman from New Jersey to serve in the Senate underscores the importance of diverse representation in our government.”\nABOUT PATRICIA CAMPOS-MEDINA\nDr. Patricia Campos-Medina, a nationally recognized labor leader and community organizer, brings a wealth of experience and a proven record of expertise to her candidacy for the United States Senate. With three decades of dedicated service in grassroots and union organizing, electoral campaigns, government affairs, and organizational management, Patricia is a proven champion for working families. Her commitment to higher education and labor education is reflected in her academic journey, from earning a scholarship to attend Cornell University to achieving a Ph.D. from Rutgers University.\nPatricia’s journey as the daughter of immigrant workers escaping civil war informs her dedication to championing education as the key to a brighter future. Her resilience and commitment to diversity and inclusivity stand as pillars in her quest to represent all New Jerseyans in the U.S. Senate. As a policy expert, Patricia has demonstrated leadership in national and state legislative campaigns, where she has tirelessly fought to protect the rights of American workers, ensuring their ability to join unions, and advocating for workplace safety, affordable healthcare, and dignified retirements. Patricia Campos-Medina is not just another candidate; she is a Jersey Girl ready to restore integrity, accountability, and trust in our politics, fighting for the opportunities every working family deserves.
