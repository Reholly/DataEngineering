    "text": "NAIROBI, Kenya, Mar 8 – President William Ruto has promoted Major General Charles Muriu Kahariri to the rank of Lieutenant General and appointed him the Vice Chief of Defence Forces.

Additionally, Major General David Kimaiyo Tarus has been promoted to Lieutenant General and appointed as the new Commander of the Kenya Army, taking over from Lieutenant General Peter Mbogo Njiru, who served for 39 years. Prior to this, Lieutenant General Tarus served as the Deputy Army Commander. President Ruto has also elevated Major General Jimson Longiro to the rank of Lieutenant General and designated him as the Vice Chancellor of the National Defence University – Kenya. Major General Longiro previously held the position of Commander of the Kenya Navy. Brigadier Thomas Nioroge Ng’ang’a has been promoted to Major General and named as the new Commander of the Kenya Navy. He succeeds Brigadier Thomas Nioroge Ng’ang’a, who was previously the Base Commander at Kenya Navy Base Manda.
