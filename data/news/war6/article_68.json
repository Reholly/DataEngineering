    "text": "Majority of Lexington council release statement calling for ceasefire in Gaza LEXINGTON, Ky. (WKYT) - Lexington Vice Mayor Dan Wu read a statement on behalf of the majority of the council during Thursday night’s meeting calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. “We ask that the government of Israel allow desperately needed humanitarian aid to reach the people of Gaza. We call for a permanent end of violence and long-lasting peace in the region. Not all council members agreed with the statement stating that local governments should not be part of foreign affairs. They do say they are against islamophobia and anti-semitism. The statement comes after pro-Palestinian groups have called for the council to take a stance. The Kentucky Jewish Council released a statement: The Kentucky Jewish Council denounces the suggested statement by Vice Mayor Wu, endorsed by the council, ostensibly calling for a Ceasefire in Israel’s War on the Hamas Genocidal Terrorist Group. The statement, which was made with no input or consultation with Lexington Jewish leaders, is in direct opposition to the community-wide letter crafted by Mayor Gorton, which called to avoid bringing the violence from Gaza here to Lexington. While this performative statement will have no effect on Gaza, it will have grave repercussions on all communities here at home. The city council has no jurisdiction or ability to affect foreign affairs, and fear of violence from protestors should not allow performative statements to take the place of the actual work our Council should be engaged in.
