    "text": "LONDON: The Palestinian town of Jericho has named a street after Aaron Bushnell, the US air force member who set himself on fire in an act of protest against Israel’s war in Gaza outside the Israeli Embassy in Washington, the Guardian reported on Sunday.\nThe incident took place on Feb. 25, when the 25-year-old, dressed in military attire, shouted “I will no longer be complicit in genocide,” during a live stream on the Internet.\nHe then doused himself in a clear liquid and set himself on fire, screaming “Free Palestine.”\nAt a ceremony to reveal the new street sign on Sunday, Jericho's Mayor Abdul Karim Sidr paid tribute to Bushnell, stating he \"sacrificed everything\" for the Palestinian cause.\n“We didn’t know him, and he didn’t know us. There were no social, economic or political ties between us. What we share is a love for freedom and a desire to stand against these attacks (on Gaza),” the mayor told the crowd.\nThe decision to name the street after Bushnell was made swiftly, just two weeks following his death. “We made a quick decision so we would be first,” Sidr said.\nThe city has also dedicated a square to South Africa in recognition of its government's legal action against Israel at the International Court of Justice, accusing it of genocide, the Guardian reported.",
