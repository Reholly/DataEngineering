    "text": "The director of The Zone of Interest accepted his award with an anti-war speech that drew praise and confusion.\nBy Shirley Li\nRich Polk / Variety / Getty March 11, 2024 Share\nSave\nThe Oscars are not built for somber appeals about current events, though the show has tried in the past to balance celebration with seriousness. Sometimes that effort has worked: In 2002, after 9/11, Tom Cruise opened the evening with a vague but elegant speech about needing movie magic “more than ever,” which eased the apparent anxiety in the room. Other times, it couldn’t completely control the proceedings: In 2003, shortly after the Iraq War began, the show tried to dissuade flashy displays of emotion and even scrapped the red carpet. But the notoriously vocal director Michael Moore had other ideas, using his Best Documentary acceptance speech to criticize President George W. Bush until he was booed offstage.\nThis year seemed poised for another festive but dry evening, devoid of any real reminders of life outside Hollywood. But then the historical drama The Zone of Interest won for Best International Feature, and the director, Jonathan Glazer, flanked by two of the film’s producers, used his speech to deliver a stark message to the audience. “Right now,” he said, his hands shaking as he held the piece of paper on which he’d written his remarks, “we stand here as men who refute their Jewishness and the Holocaust being hijacked by an occupation which has led to conflict for so many innocent people. Whether the victims of October the 7th in Israel or the ongoing attack on Gaza—all the victims of this dehumanization.” (Unsurprisingly, the response to his remarks has been intense—a mix of praise and derision but also confusion stemming from some people seizing on only the first part of what he said, and assuming he was refuting his Jewishness full-stop.)",
