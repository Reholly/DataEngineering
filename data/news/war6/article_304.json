    "text": "WWE's Undertaker bringing 1deadMAN SHOW to Philly during Wrestlemania week Dead men don't dance. But apparently, they do tell stories. And on April 4 at the Fillmore in Philadelphia, the professional wrestler known the world over as the Undertaker will do just that. UNDERTAKER 1 deadMAN SHOW will take center stage two days before the city hosts Wrestlemania 40. The Undertaker, also known as Mark Calloway, spent decades entertaining fans as one of the top wrestlers in World Wrestling Entertainment. He's been in the ring with everyone you can imagine and was known as the leader of WWE for most of his stint. The show tells stories of his career, and has been an extremely popular ticket. It's also sold out venues in Nashville, Boston, San Antonio and Australia since debuting in 2022. World Wrestling Entertainment is taking over Philadelphia, beginning with the one-man show. Friday, WWE will hold a live Smackdown taping at the Wells Fargo Center. After the taping WWE will hold its annual Hall of Fame ceremony with Paul Heyman, former owner of Philly-based ECW getting inducted. Saturday, WWE will hold an NXT premium live event Stand and Deliver, at the Wells Fargo Center. The main event will be Saturday and Sunday when WWE holds Wrestlemania 40 at Lincoln Financial Field. While the card is still isn't official, the Rock and Roman Reigns have challenged Cody Rhodes and Seth Rollins to a match on Saturday. That would likely mean Sunday would include Reigns defending his championship against Rhodes and Rollins will defend his championship against Drew McIntyre. And on Monday, WWE will present its most popular Monday Night Raws of the year, the one after Wrestlemania, at the Wells Fargo Center. Tickets for UNDERTAKER 1 deadMAN SHOW go on sale Wednesday, March 13 at 10 a.m. ET. An exclusive presale opportunity will be available starting Tuesday, March 12 at 10 a.m. ET at https://www.ticketmaster.com/event/02006067C3086197. A limited number of VIP tickets, which include premier seating and a meet-and-greet with The Undertaker, will also be available.",
