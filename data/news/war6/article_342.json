    "text": "Fitting the rubber gasket\n#\n1\nMember\nThread Starter\nJoin Date: Nov 2014\nLocation: USA\nPosts: 266\nReceived 3 Upvotes on\n3 Posts\nFitting the rubber gasket\nModel # LG WM2487HWMA and having trouble fitting my washer door boot into the fitting. I've figured out the orientation and direction of the part but there are a few nooks and crannies I can fit it into but don't know which one to place it in.\nThe one fitting that makes the most sense is one that will allow the inner tub to rotate freely and if the rubber touches the inner tub it will create too much friction and rip it off. So there's a configuration that makes sense, doesn't touch the metal tub but it does't appear to sit flush with the outer tub and I can't figure out what the metal clamp would attach to.\nHere are some photos:\nSide view of the door boot. Looks correct here.\nSide view.\nBottom of the tub, notice a gap.\nHere's where the ring connects, but it's not tight at all.\nThe one fitting that makes the most sense is one that will allow the inner tub to rotate freely and if the rubber touches the inner tub it will create too much friction and rip it off.
