    "text": "|\n|\nThank you, Steven, for this powerful but painful article, and for praising Foer's book. When I went to Ukraine in 2006, I visited Lvov, Zbarazh, Skalat, Chernivitsi (formerly Czernowitz), and Tarnopol, my ancestral towns, and was escorted by Alex Dunai, a terrific guide. One of my goals was to see the towering cenotaph for Zbarazh, which I had found online, and begins \"Here Lies Soap.\" But when I showed Alex a photograph of it, he said it wasn't in Zbarazh; it had been erected by survivors in 1947 and was in Beth David Cemetery in Elmont NY - barely one hour from my house (!)\nI describe my Ukrainian visits and subsequent trip to Beth David extensively in BECAUSE OF EVA: A Jewish Genealogical Journey (pub by Syracuse U Press, 2016). Parts, including \"Here Lies Soap,\" were also published over the years in the Forward, the Jewish Week of New York, and The Galizianer.\nSusan J. Gordon\nNew York\nZBARAZH - Bialazurker, Geist, Schoenhaut\nSKALAT - Schoenhaut\nLVOV - Lempert\nCHERNIVITSI - Lempert\n|\n|",
