Newer threats in the conflict spectrum have added to the complexities,\" he said.The Army chief said that \"grey zone actions and aggression by our adversaries is manifesting across multiple domains including the military i.e. on land, air and maritime space\".Consequent to all these developments, the battle space has become more \"complex, contested and lethal and shall remain so in the future\", General Pande said.He highlighted how warfare has diversified into new domains, including cyber, electromagnetic spectrum, information, and space.
