Ever on the warpath, the evil branch indulged in an hour of vilifying everyone not on their team. The stupid party is useless as opposition. How many of them voted to extend the NDAA and its domestic spying. How many of them voted for the kill switch. Cars used to be engineered to make them as simple to start and run as possible. Maybe one day the wokesters will have a kill switch that can be activated if your social credit score doesn't meet their approval.\nI don't think that Orangeman is smart enough to seek retribution against his enemies. If he's allowed to occupy the White House again, he'll probably reappoint rabid tribesman Jared Kushner to screw things up again along with some folks of the same ilk as Jeff Sessions, Bill Barr, Mike Pompeo, and John Bolton. Victoria Nuland will also be available for Kushner's consideration.\nOur country doesn't realize that it's like the Roadrunner cartoons' Wiley Coyote after he's run off a cliff.\n@Dingleberry, it may even be 70% or greater.\n2024-03-09 14:34:58\nClick for\nDMCA\nand\nUser Conduct\ncomplaints, along with our\nprivacy policy.\nAKCS V52.3 Copyright 1993-2024 Karl Denninger.
