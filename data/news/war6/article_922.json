    "text": "Billie Eilish , Finneas, Mark Ruffalo, Ava DuVernay, Ramy Youssef and Quannah Chasinghorse are among the latest stars to step onto the red carpet in matching red lapel pins – this time at the Academy Awards .\nAnd though he did not walk the carpet, actor Mahershala Ali also donned one of the pins when helping introduce the nominees for this year's Best Supporting Actor award.\nBut what do they mean?\nLIVE UPDATES: The winners, surprises and biggest moments from the 2024 Oscars\nBillie Eilish is one of many celebrities who have worn the pin on the red carpet.
