SAF’s History Supporting NATO SAF Tehnika has played a crucial role in supporting NATO's objectives, beginning with its pivotal contribution in 2009 by deploying the Marathon II microwave link system at the British Antarctic Survey's Halley VI station. This effort significantly bolstered NATO’s environmental monitoring, aiding in the assessment of global security dynamics. Building on this foundation, SAF further extended its support in 2012 through its involvement in NATO's Mediterranean Dialogue initiative. By enhancing Egypt's communication infrastructure with the PhoeniX split mount radio system, SAF not only addressed Egypt's specific communication needs but also aligned with NATO's strategic goals by enhancing interoperability and monitoring capabilities across member states.
