    "text": "On May 21, 1968, nurse Jan McCarthy arrived in South Vietnam to take up a post at the 1st Australian Field Hospital at Vũng Tàu .\nIt was her 28th birthday, and McCarthy would spend the next 12 months in the region, working around the clock treating patients injured on the frontline of the Vietnam War.\nMcCarthy oversaw the theatre technicians and later worked in the ICU, dealing with a raft of traumatic injuries, including amputations and other wounds caused by gunshots, shrapnel and bomb blasts.\n\"If the battalions were out in the jungles, we were constantly on the go because you never quite knew what was going to happen,\" she says.\nListen to ABC RN's The Book Show Your weekly destination for in-depth literary interviews as well news and analysis about the publishing industry. A must-listen for lovers of fiction.\nRead more\nIt was McCarthy's job to triage the casualties who arrived by helicopter and send critical cases straight into theatre for surgery.\n\"We got them very quick. I think the quickest we had someone on the table from the time they were wounded … was 18 minutes,\" she says.\nDuring her 12-month posting, she lost just one soldier on the operating table.\nMore than 50 years later, the critical role played by nurses like McCarthy during the Vietnam War remains relatively unknown.\nHowever, recognition of their extraordinary service is growing, thanks in part to the efforts of two women — an Australian and an American — who have dedicated themselves to telling these important stories.\nCheerful in the face of adversity In the book Our Vietnam Nurses, author and journalist Annabelle Brayley shares the stories of some of the hundreds of nurses — including McCarthy — who served in Vietnam during the war.\nMore than 40 Royal Australian Army Nursing Corps (RAANC) nurses served in Vietnam until Australia's withdrawal from the conflict in 1971. The first group — Lieutenants Colleen Mealy, Margaret Ahern, Terrie Roche, and Captain Amy Pittendreigh — known as the 'Fab Four', arrived at the 8th Australian Field Ambulance at Vũng Tàu in 1967.\nThe 'Fab 4' nurses of the Vietnam War: Captain Amy Pittendreigh and Lieutenants Terrie Roche, Colleen Mealy and Margaret Ahern. ( Supplied: Shaun Gibbons/Dennis Gibbons AM )\nBetween 1965 and 1972, 106 nursing officers served at the Butterworth Air Force Base in Malaysia. Many of their patients were military personnel evacuated from Vietnam.\nMany of these nurses joined Australian medevac crews that flew into Vietnam, a fact they were ordered to keep secret.\nThirty-two RAAF nurses also completed 60-day secondments with the US air force. Based in Manila, the nurses formed part of the four daily 'milk runs' — medevac missions to pick up wounded American and Korean soldiers in South Vietnam.\nA huge Hercules aircraft could fit 60 casualties — 40 stretchers stacked five high and 20 walking wounded — who were triaged and managed by the flight nurse as they flew back to base, often under enemy fire.\nLieutenant Colleen Mealy tends to a patient at the 8th Australian Field Ambulance in South Vietnam in 1967. ( Supplied: Shaun Gibbons/Dennis Gibbons AM )\nMore than 200 civilian nurses also joined surgical teams in South Vietnam, replacing Vietnamese medical staff seconded into the military.\nIn the aftermath of the 1968 Tet Offensive (one of the largest military campaigns of the war), the Australian surgical staff worked non-stop for days at Long Xuyen hospital, treating the massive number of civilian casualties that overwhelmed the poorly resourced provincial hospitals.\n\"The team operated around the clock, cleaning, debriding, packing or suturing every conceivable traumatic injury, including stumps where limbs had been blown off, only stopping to sleep when they couldn't stand any longer,\" Brayley writes in Our Vietnam Nurses.\nThe conditions in the hospitals were appalling, she says.\n\"There'd be 400 beds and 600 patients, and the electricity was intermittent, and the water was intermittent … and yet, they cheerfully went about their tasks and did the very best they could to support the civilian teams there.\"\nMcCarthy says the nurses took the serious challenges of the job in their stride.\n\"You had a role to play, and as a nurse, you had to do your job and just get on with it,\" she says.\nNo support at home US novelist Kristin Hannah is the author of 25 books, including the 2015 bestseller, The Nightingale, set in German-occupied France in World War II.\nHannah spent 12 months researching The Women, reading the memoirs and diaries of nurses who served in Vietnam. ( Supplied: Pan Macmillan Australia )\nIn her latest novel, The Women, Hannah places readers in the thick of the action in a Vietnam War field hospital, where helicopter medevacs known as dust offs and mass casualty events known as MASCALs are part of daily life.\nThe main character, 21-year-old Frankie McGrath, enlists as a nurse in the US army and is posted to the 36th Evacuation Hospital in Vietnam after a perfunctory eight weeks' training.\nHannah said she wanted to illustrate the perilous conditions nurses like the fictional Frankie faced every day.\n\"You see her go from a woman who's literally sobbing in the corner saying, 'I have no business being here' to a take-charge surgical nurse who can help a doctor close a wound while they're being bombed,\" she tells ABC RN's The Book Show .\nWhen they returned home, nurses in the US faced the same opprobrium and lack of support that greeted their Australian counterparts.\n\"When the women vets came home from Vietnam, many of them were suffering from what we now know is PTSD, and there was no help for them,\" Hannah says.\n\"They kept saying that these women had not been in combat because they weren't shooting guns, they weren't being shot at, and so it was really important for me to show … what it was like in these hospitals.\n\"I defy anyone to say that is not being in combat.\"\nMissing in action Hannah's fascination with the Vietnam War stems from her childhood in the 70s, when her best friend's father, a helicopter pilot, was shot down and declared missing.\nFor years, Hannah wore a silver 'prisoner of war bracelet' printed with his name and the date he was lost.\n\"The idea was that you wore these bracelets in remembrance until the person came home,\" she says.\nFor years, Hannah says, \"the Vietnam era was a subject that really nobody wanted to talk about\". ( Supplied: Pan Macmillan Australia/Kevin Lynch )\nLater, Hannah witnessed the hostility that greeted Vietnam veterans returning home from the war.\nShe says their poor treatment by the public was an injustice she always wanted to explore in her writing.\n\"There was no gratitude for their service, and … it just made a huge impression on me,\" she says.\nWhile Hannah describes the Vietnam War as \"a national embarrassment\" for the US, she says the contribution of \"young [and] naïve … nurses who answered their country's call to duty and went to war\" should be more widely recognised.\n\"It's shocking to me that their service has been forgotten.\"\nRecognition a long time coming When McCarthy flew home to Australia in 1969 on her 29th birthday — the only woman on the plane — she says there was plenty of excitement among her fellow passengers.\nHowever, the returning servicemen and women faced a cool or even openly hostile reception from the public.\n\"We were told once you got back into Australia … not to wear your uniform outside the barrack area,\" she says.\n\"People had no idea what it was like, so you didn't speak about it too much.\"\nSuch was the culture of silence surrounding the Vietnam War that many nurses journalist Annabelle Brayley interviewed didn't tell anyone about their service — not even their families.\nThe civilian nurses of the Vietnam War Civilian medical staff who worked in Vietnam during the war suffered similar health problems to veterans, but were denied access to subsidised health care.\nRead more\nMcCarthy went on to have a long career in the army, rising to the rank of Colonel and serving as Director of Army Nursing Services and Matron-in-Chief of the RAANC before she retired in 1992.\nShe says army nurses have always been recognised for their Vietnam service. But other nurses had to wait much longer.\nThe Department of Defence refused to acknowledge the service of RAAF nurses during the Vietnam War until 1994 on the grounds they were based in Malaysia, not Vietnam. It's a decision Brayley says was unfair.\n\"[The nurses] were on the ground … every time they got out of a plane to load wounded to take them back to Butterworth [Air Force Base],\" she says.\n\"[And] every time they were on the ground — and particularly the 32 who flew for USAF … picking up and transporting patients — they were in danger.\"\nThe civilian nurses had to wait until 2020, when Josh Frydenberg and Darren Chester (then treasurer and minister of veteran affairs, respectively) passed legislation entitling them to Vietnam service medals and the essential Gold Cards, which provide them with access to healthcare and support services.\nGiven their service, it was a decision long overdue, Brayley says.\n\"Few of them have returned without any impact from the time they spent in Vietnam,\" she says.\nAustralia's first Vietnam Nurses Memorial In 2023, Hannah travelled to Washington, DC to attend the 30th anniversary of the dedication of the Women's Vietnam Memorial.\n\"It was so remarkable to see 100 female Vietnam War vets coming together laughing and crying and hugging each other and talking over what they had sacrificed, what they'd suffered, what they'd shared, and to feel that they were being embraced,\" she says.\n\"It was just a wonderful moment.\"\nIn Australia, no such memorial has existed — until now.\nAnnabelle Brayley on Conversations The Australian author discusses her book honouring the nurses of the Vietnam War.\nRead more\nEight years after the publication of her book, Brayley is leading a new project honouring nurses who served in Vietnam. The Vietnam Nurses Memorial is a photographic exhibition that will open at the Morven Historical Museum in central Queensland on April 24, 2024.\n\"It will be a permanent display that includes civilian, RAAF and army nurses, and … there'll be a very loose chronological story of their service in Vietnam that will reflect a story of the Vietnam War itself,\" Brayley says.\nSix nurses will travel to Morven, a tiny town 650 kilometres west of Brisbane, to attend the exhibition opening and march with local school children in the Anzac Day parade.\n\"This is going to be pretty special,\" Brayley says.\nRN in your inbox Get more stories that go beyond the news cycle with our weekly newsletter.\nYour information is being handled in accordance with the ABC Privacy Collection Statement .
