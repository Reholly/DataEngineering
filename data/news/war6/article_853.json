    "text": "2024-03-10 16:21:00\nThe Jordanian Armed Forces carried out 10 airdrops of humanitarian aid to northern Gaza this Saturday.\nThe airdrops were carried out in cooperation with the United States, France, Egypt and Belgium, the military said in a statement.\n“Jordan continues its efforts and efforts to send more medical, relief and food aid to the population of Gaza City with the aim of compensating for the acute shortage of food and medicine as a result of the ongoing Israeli war in the enclave,” it says. the notice.\nJordan said it has carried out 35 aid airdrops in Gaza since Nov. 6.\nVideo obtained by CNN on Saturday shows several military transport planes dropping humanitarian aid into areas of Gaza.\nA little context: While airdrops are a quick way to get supplies into a conflict zone, aid agencies say their drawbacks overwhelmingly outweigh their benefits.\nFor starters, they are more expensive. Airdrops cost up to seven times more than ground deliveries, says the World Food Programme. They also have a much more limited delivery capacity.\n“Aid workers always complain that airdrops are good photo opportunities but a terrible way to deliver aid,” Richard Gowan, United Nations director of the International Crisis Group, told CNN.\nAid workers are urging the United States to pressure its ally Israel to lift its strict siege on the enclave, which has left Palestinians on the brink of famine.\n1710095193\n#news #hostage #release",
