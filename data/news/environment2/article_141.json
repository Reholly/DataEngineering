The U.N. calls the promise the “30-by-30 target.” It aims to protect plants and animals severely affected by climate change, pollution, and habitat destruction.\nIn October, U.N. delegates will gather for a COP16 biodiversity meeting in Colombia to discuss plans for reaching the 30-by-30 goal.\nFILE - This photo of the endangered kagu was taken at the Preservation and Research Center in Yokohama, Japan, Oct. 25, 2010. (REUTERS/Yuriko Nakao) The recent study was published in Frontiers in Science. In it, the researchers aimed to identify the highest value areas around the world. Carlos Peres said he hopes the areas identified will be included in protection plans. Peres was a co-writer of the study and is a conservation ecology expert at the University of East Anglia in Britain.\nPerese said, \"Most countries do not actually have a strategy .”\nHe said, \"The 30-by-30 targets still lack a lot of details because it doesn't actually say what 30 percent should be protected.\"\nThe study's proposed protections would cover an additional 1.6 million square kilometers. This is an area about one fifth the size of the United States. The study includes 16,825 sites that are home to rare and threatened wildlife.\nFILE - These endangered Mexican gray wolves rest at the Museo del Desierto in Saltillo, Mexico, July 1, 2020. (REUTERS/Daniel Becerril/File Photo) It is estimated that nearly 16 percent of the world’s surface already has some level of protection.\nThe study estimated that the cost of purchasing land by governments would be about $263 billion. Many of these areas include private property and would be bought at current market values over the next five years.\n\"Time is not on our side,” Peres said, “because it will become increasingly more expensive and more difficult to set aside additional protected areas.”\nMost of the cost of creating protected areas is in buying the land. The study did not consider the costs for policing and maintaining the nature preserves.\nFILE - The waldrapp, a critically endangered species, sits inside the breeding aviary cage at the Preservation and Research Center in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, October 25, 2010. (REUTERS/Yuriko Nakao/File Photo) About three-quarters of the sites are tropical forests. The Philippines, Brazil, and Indonesia are home to more than half of the high-valued areas.\nRussia is the one country with the most high-valued areas. The study said about 138,000 square kilometers should be the target of conservation.\nSeveral African countries are also at the top of the list. Madagascar has the fourth-highest number of areas. And the Democratic Republic of Congo has the largest area targeted for conservation in Africa.\nThe United States is among the top 30 countries in the study. The study said about 0.6 percent of the U.S. should be targeted for conservation. That is an area about the size of the state of Delaware.\nThe researchers only considered land and freshwater areas. They did not consider oceans or marine protected areas. The study also did not include kinds of animals such as invertebrates, or animals without a backbone, like insects.\nThe U.S.-based nonprofit group One Earth paid for the study.\nI’m Anna Matteo.\nJake Spring reported this story for Reuters.
