    "text": "Climate change poses huge challenges for the financial sector, too. The Bundesbank supports the transition to a low-carbon economy.\nA digital euro would be a digital form of central bank money, specifically the euro. It could be used by the general public in much the same way as cash, only in virtual form. Alongside cash, the Eurosystem would thus supply households with an additional form of central bank money that can be used quickly, easily and securely.\nThe Bundesbank provides a new procedure for the automated download of statistical data sets. The web service offers an interface for programmatic access.\nThe Bundesbank’s up-to-date statistical data in the form of time series (also available to download as a CSV file or SDMX-ML file).\nHere you will find information on the bank sort code file and on the bank sort code update service. You can also download the bank sort code files.\nIn the press area, you will find press releases, speeches, guest contributions and interviews with Bundesbank Executive Board members as well as further press materials.\nThe Bundesbank published various studies and conference proceedings, resulting from the research activities of its employees and guest researchers.\nWith the dual bachelor's degree in applied computer science, we offer an attractive career in the world of information technology.\n189 KB,\nPDF",
