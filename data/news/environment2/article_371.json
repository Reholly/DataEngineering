    "text": "Five million hits! It’s pretty amazing to realise we’ve been running SV-POW! for nearly seventeen years now, since [1st October 2007](/v3/r2/?url=aHR0cHM6Ly9zdnBvdy5jb20vMjAwNy8xMC8wMS9oZWxsby13b3JsZC8=). And it’s astonishing, and gratifying, and even a tiny by humbling, to see how popular it’s been in its niche. That niche has turned out to be a bit bigger than we could have imagined, and I am delighted to say that earlier today we notched up our five millionth view! (See the bottom of the sidebar for a live count.) In this time, we’ve posted 1,622 articles (as well a 70 non-blogpost pages), and y’all have added 21,720 comments. So on Matt’s and my behalf, I thank you all for joining us on this wild ride. Your comments are a huge part of what makes this fun to do. We’ve always loved writing this blog, and we still do — and we have no plans to stop any time soon!
