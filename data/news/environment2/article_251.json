    "text": "The teachings of green Islam do not only stipulate provisions in the dimension of mahdah (worship) alone, but also provides answers to various issues that we face in this climate crisis. slam, which advocates the principle of amar maâ€™ruf nahi munkar (promoting the good, deterring the bad), is a religion that is based on the teachings of the Quran and Sunnah. Its followers strive to establish a society that embodies the ideals of baldatun tayyibatun warabun ghafur (a just and prosperous community). This vision is in accordance with the will of Allah, who has entrusted humans with the responsibility of being His servants and representatives on earth. In Indonesia, Muslims have been dedicated to promoting an understanding of Islam known as wasatiah, which aims to bring about compassion and mercy in all aspects of life. This endeavor has been ongoing for hundreds of years. Hence, it is crucial to actively promote and cultivate an understanding of Islam that remains relevant and beneficial to humanity in the face of changing times. This involves ongoing efforts and processes to raise awareness about the significance of embracing Islam as a religion that adapts and provides benefits to individuals. Throughout history, there have always been individuals or groups advocating for ishlah (improvement) or tajdid (renewal) within the Muslim community, recognizing the need for continuous growth and development. To perform this mission, Muslims place Islam as a foundation, guidance and spirit in treading changes, which manifests in the form of thought, movement and service. The progressive Islamic movement has at least three important capitals to do good and forbid evil: (1) al-quwwah jam'iyyah (capital of togetherness), (2) al-quwwah al-'ilmiyyah (capital of knowledge) and (3) al-quwwah at-tajdidiyyah (capital of progressiveness that can respond to various present problems). The Muslim ummah has strong foundations in carrying out movements in overcoming the climate crisis, some of these examples are Islamic movements that have become a light in the midst of the climate crisis. One of the practical actions to translate this awareness is the use of solar panels in communities and houses of worship, which supports the just energy transition narrative. Istiqlal Grand Mosque, the At-Tanwir Building and Mosque at the Muhammadiyah Central Board in Jakarta and Al-Muharram Mosque in Tamantirto village, Bantul regency, Yogyakarta, are among prominent examples of the green Islam movement.
