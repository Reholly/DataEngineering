In addition, it has attracted £1bn in savings deposits from farm businesses and consumers wanting to support the rural economy and has reached break-even profitability. The bank has a target to achieve a £1bn balance sheet in 2024.\nThe Chester-based bank is backed by institutional agriculture and AgTech investors, as well as other stakeholders in the sector. In total Oxbury has raised in excess of £120m in investment since inception with further capital-raising initiatives planned to support ongoing lending growth.\nSince first announcing the original ENABLE Guarantee last year, we have been thrilled at the pace at which we’ve been able to support around 170 SME farming businesses across the country, with over £140m of vital funding to help support and grow their businesses.\nBy doubling the original transaction – and including the new sustainability incentive – Oxbury will be able to rapidly increase the impact of our lending across the farming and rural economy.James Farrar Co-Founder and CEO at Oxbury Bank\nWe’re pleased to agree this transaction increase with Oxbury Bank. It has demonstrated its commitment to supporting smaller businesses in the agricultural sector and we hope the extra lending capacity facilitated by the ENABLE Guarantee will allow it to build on that in 2024 and beyond.Michael Strevens Head of Structured Guarantees, Guarantee and Wholesale Solutions, British Business Bank\nFurther Information\nIf you are a journalist and have a media enquiry, please contact\n[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2d404849444c48435c58445f44485e6d4f5f4459445e45004f585e4443485e5e004f4c4346034e42035846).\nNotes to editors\nAbout the British Business Bank\nThe British Business Bank is the UK government’s economic development bank. Established in November 2014, its mission is to drive sustainable growth and prosperity across the UK and to enable the transition to a net zero economy, by improving access to finance for smaller businesses. Its remit is to design, deliver and efficiently manage UK-wide smaller business access to finance programmes for the UK government.\nThe British Business Bank’s core programmes support over £12.4bn\n[\nRead footnote text\n1\n](#footnote1_x9qr6q7)\nof finance to more than 90,000 smaller businesses [\nRead footnote text\n2\n](#footnote2_7jl1fr8)\n.\nAs well as increasing the supply and diversity of finance for UK smaller businesses through its programmes, the Bank works to raise awareness of finance options available to smaller businesses.
