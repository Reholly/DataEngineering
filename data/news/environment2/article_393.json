    "text": "If you love creamy pumpkin soup in the winter, you’ll want to invest in the correct\n kitchen appliances to help you create your favourite winter dish. And while some may think any ol’ blen d er will do when it comes to blending soup (or hot liquids), we’re here to tell you – and warn you – any ol’ blender absolutely won’t do. In fact, it’s incredibly dangerous to blend hot liquids in a blender that is not designed to do so.\nWhat are the best blenders for hot soups?\nHot liquids, like\nsoups or purees, can expand during the blending process and, for lack of a better word, explode, when you use a blender that isn’t designed for hot liquids. Therefore, hot liquids in a normal blender is a recipe for disaster. However, there are specialty blenders, namely, hot and cold blenders, that are designed to handle both hot and cold liquids.\nWhat are hot and cold blenders?\nGiven their name, hot and cold blenders are designed to blend both hot and cold liquids with ease. These blenders are made from high-quality glass that is heat resistant. Further, hot and cold blenders often have extra safety elements such as a lid lock or overheating protection/sensors. Some high-tech models also include a heating feature within the appliance so you can cook your soup with the blender.\n2024’s top hot and cold blenders\n- Ninja Foodi cold and hot blender, $299 (usually $399), Myer (\n[here’s why](#1))\n- Kleva Mealio hot and cold blender, $197, Amazon (\n[here’s why](#2))\n- Tefal Perfectmix hot and cold blender, $279.66, Amazon (\n[here’s why](#3))\nThe best hot and cold blenders 2024\nReady to blitz up your soups, purees, and more ASAP?
