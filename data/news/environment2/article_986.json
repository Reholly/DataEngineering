    "text": "Good and timely monsoon rain has boosted the prospects of main horticultural crops, namely tomatoes, onions, and potatoes, said the government on Friday in a statement.\nThis should help in their prices moderating. Click here to connect with us on WhatsApp\nTomato: Higher acreage target\nThe statement said an assessment by the Ministry of Agriculture showed this kharif season, a higher acreage of 272,000 hectares had been targeted as against 267,000 last year.\nThe condition of the crop is good in major producing areas of Chittoor, Andhra Pradesh, and Kolar, Karnataka.\n“In Kolar, picking of tomatoes has started and will hit the market within a few days from now,” the statement added.\nBased on feedback from district officials, it has been reported that tomato crop yields in Chittoor and Kolar are better than last year.\nAdditionally, there has been a notable increase in cultivation areas in the major growing states of Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu.\nThe wholesale prices of tomatoes in Delhi are slightly lower than they were a year ago.\nHowever, the data indicates that prices were high just a few weeks ago.\nOnions: Good supply\nThe statement indicates there is a comfortable supply in domestic markets despite a slight decrease in production during the 2024 rabi season over the previous year.

It said 27.32 million tonnes was stored in cold storage this year, which is sufficient to meet the consumption demand\n“The prices of potato regulate the rate at which it’s released from the cold storages during the storage period from March to December,” the statement said. Tomato prices in Delhi surge to Rs 70-80 per kg Retail prices of tomatoes in Delhi have surged to around Rs 70-80 per kg on lower supply due to recent heatwave conditions.\n Mother Dairy is selling tomatoes at Rs 75 per kg. Local vendors are selling at Rs 70-80 per kg. Online marketplaces Otipy, Blinkit are selling at Rs 80 per kg.
