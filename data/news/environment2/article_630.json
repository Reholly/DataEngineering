    "text": "BYD said on Thursday it has produced its eight millionth electric vehicles, just three months after producing its seven millionth unit globally at its Jinan factory in eastern China in March and three years after reaching its first millionth unit mark in mid-2021. The latest milestone was achieved at BYD’s newly opened factory in Rayong, Thailand, which is capable of producing 150,000 vehicles annually, and happened to be a blue BYD Dolphin hatchback, the most popular EV model in the country. The Chinese EV giant has found initial success in Southeast Asia’s second-largest economy with sales of 12,942 units between January and May, capturing roughly 40% of the country’s booming EV segment, according to figures compiled by Autolife Thailand. Smaller Chinese rival Hozon in December began trial production on the outskirts of Bangkok with an output of up to 20,000 units annually, while China’s biggest car manufacturer SAIC has been making gas-powered MG cars in the country with Thai conglomerate CP Group since 2014.
