    "text": "Greening Future Generation (GFG) in celebrating Environmental Awareness Month launched a roll-out of My Mess, My Responsibility, My Livelihood 2023 campaign on June 27 at Phiri Community Hall.\nThe event was held to address critical environmental issues impacting Soweto through illegal dumping and other forms of pollution which threaten the ecosystem and residents’ livelihood.\nGFG partnered with the City of Johannesburg in line with their Growth and Development Strategy (GDS 2040), Pickitup, Local Councillors for Ward 15 and 16, and Mrs eSoweto Sharleen Jones who is the ambassador of the campaign.\nSilence Ntshatsha who is the manager of Pickitup stated that it was an honour for them to be part of the event.\nShe also mentioned that such initiatives are very important in the community and that it is time that people know how to handle waste because there’s currently a dumping crisis in Soweto.\n“Over five places have problems with dumping including Phiri.\n“This launch in partnership with us as Pickitup is truly a great honour seeing that there are people out there who appreciate taking care of the environment and reducing waste amongst communities,” said Ntshatsha.\nMrs eSoweto in partnership with the GFG campaign has promised to inspire and engage with the community towards taking ownership and responsibility of their environment.\n“It is such a blessing to be here today as we celebrate Environmental Awareness Month.\n“As I was driving, I came across a guy driving and he threw away a bottle after consuming what he was consuming and I felt offended by his action because that is not only pollution but also, he could’ve harmed anyone passing by.\n“It is important to have such events to teach such people about certain actions especially if they harm the environment,” said Jones.\nGFG hosted a five-day event from June 24 to the 28.\nThe event had a workshop session and two environmental education blitzes hosted in Mapetla, Phiri, and Senaone, stakeholder engagement and launch. A 5km marathon where they were transforming illegal dumping sites into community assets was also part of the campaign.",
