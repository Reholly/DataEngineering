    "text": "10 Sustainable Sandals To Slide Into Summer 2024\nThe Good Trade editors endorse products we’ve personally researched, tested, and genuinely love. Learn more about our methodology and business model\nhere.\nWe’ve worn and researched sustainable shoes for a decade — these are 10 eco-friendly, ethical brands for comfortable and affordable sandals and slides that you’ll reach for all summer long.\nSummer’s here and we are ready. From sipping Aperol spritzes at outdoor happy hours, to hanging out at the beach, to visiting our local farmer’s market for the most delicious strawberries, we are embracing all of the warmer weather activities and the fashion that comes along with it. We’ve rounded up a few of our favorite brands that are bringing ethical and fair trade sandals to the masses. We love all the new recyclable styles and are partial to easy slides ourselves. Happy summer (and shopping)!\nWhy consider sustainable sandals?\nSustainable sandals are better for not only the environment, but also your personal health. Some sandals, like the popular\njelly sandals, are made from PVC (polyvinyl chloride) and present significant environmental and health concerns. PVC is non-biodegradable and can release harmful chemicals like phthalates, which pose health risks and contribute to pollution throughout their lifecycle. (Don’t fret, as we’ve listed some safer alternatives to the jelly sandal in our roundup below!) Opting to go for sustainable sandals made from eco-friendly materials like recycled plastics, organic cotton, and responsibly sourced leather, help reduce environmental impact, are often biodegradable, and are safer for our bodies.\nEco-friendly sandals are also produced using ethical labor practices, ensuring fair wages and safe working conditions for workers. Sustainable sandals are also designed for durability, reducing the need for frequent replacements and minimizing waste. By opting for sustainable sandals, you support practices that protect the planet, reduce pollution, and promote social responsibility, making a positive impact with every step!\nOur criteria:\nWe’ve worn, researched, and even corresponded with sustainable shoe brands over the years. Below, we’ve compiled our 10 favorite sustainable sandals that are eco-friendly, ethically made, and are comfortable enough that you’ll want to slip them on all summer. We’ve included a variety of price points, too. We return to this list with regular updates as we find new options that meet the following criteria.\n- ETHICAL PRACTICES | These sustainable shoe brands adhere to ethical commitments in all they do, including labor practices like fair wages and safe working environments. We’ve prioritized brands that give back to their communities.\n- ECO-FRIENDLY/SUSTAINABLE | All of the brands below sustainably source materials and produce their footwear thoughtfully, with most using all natural materials and recycled/upcycled materials when possible.\n- COMFORTABLE | Our editors have tried all of the brands on this list, and confirmed that they’re comfortable and supportive so you can avoid the dreaded summer blisters.\n- AFFORDABLE | Sandals, and especially sustainable sandals, can be an investment. We’ve chosen brands at a variety of price points so there’s something for every budget.\nBe sure to check out our guides on\nethical handbags, eco friendly sunglasses, and sustainable swimwear for all your summer essentials!
