    "text": "Most people in this country are worried about climate change and want their government to act on it. But for too long, many politicians have acted like voters don’t really care. As the 2024 election approached and climate disasters piled up, something had to change. Enter Project Climate Vote To counter this, Greenpeace UK did something it’s never done before – a nationwide mass door-knocking programme to recruit climate voters and make them visible to politicians. For the first time ever, our volunteer network transformed into a campaigning machine on a mission to turn the climate-concerned majority into a political force that all parties would have to reckon with. From the streets to social media, over phone or on the doorstep, Greenpeace volunteers went out canvassing for the climate. We recruited nearly a quarter of a million Climate Voters – people who pledged to vote with climate and nature in mind. Help keep up the pressure Let’s make sure the new government keep their climate promises. We’re hatching a plan to hold every MP accountable – including yours. Are you in? [Get involved](https://action.greenpeace.org.uk/climate-voter-mass-lobby?source=WB&subsource=ECCLPLVOWB01GT) By numbers 50,000 doors knocked 14,000+ phone calls made 63,000+ posters distributed 10,315 emails sent to candidates 223,737 people committed to vote with climate and nature in mind 1,000,000+ people saw our [voting guide](https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/take-action/project-climate-vote/ranking/) 245+ seats flipped to a more climate-friendly party [According to Greenpeace's manifesto analysis of cross-UK parties.](https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/take-action/project-climate-vote/ranking/)",
