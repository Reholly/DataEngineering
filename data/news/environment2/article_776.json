    "text": "Oakland County’s animal shelter and pet adoption center is busy and close to capacity.\nThere won’t be any special adoption events in the near future, said division manager Bob Gatt.\n“We don’t have an event coming up because we’re so busy,” he said. “Crowd adoption events take time and staff.”\nRelated Articles Local News | Two hurt in separate Oakland County lake incidents on the Fourth of July Local News | Art Fair returns to Royal Oak this weekend Local News | Drew Basile of Birmingham wins spot in Jeopardy! Tournament of Champions Local News | Blast levels pump house at Royal Oak’s Red Run Golf Course Local News | Flare night tradition returns to Lake Orion People can visit the shelter to adopt animals during the six days the office is open, he said.\nThis week the shelter had 151 dogs in the building and 130 cats – including 40 kittens Gatt described as “gorgeous” – plus more cats and dogs being fostered by volunteers in family homes.\n“We’re really, really crowded and we have some great dogs here,” he said.\nPeople who can’t adopt but would like to help in other ways can donate supplies or volunteer to be a foster home to the shelter’s dogs. This improves their social skills and their chances for a permanent home, Gatt said, adding that all food and medical care is supplied free for fostered pets.\nPeople interested in volunteering can visit the shelter during regular hours and talk to a staff member.\nRelated Articles Local News | Keeping dogs and other pets safe during Fourth of July fireworks Local News | Are pet dogs and cats the weak link in bird flu surveillance?
