    "text": "The six courses cover a range of topics, including agriculture and food systems, ecosystem services, gender, governance, sustainable development and modelling, all with a focus on climate change. The topics were identified during workshops in Islamabad and Lahore in May 2023, ensuring they meet the specific needs and interests of Pakistani universities.\nThe newly developed courses were presented as part of two launch events in Islamabad and Lahore at the end of June, attracting around 100 participants from academia and research, based in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab and Islamabad. The events served as a platform not only for presenting the courses, but also for fostering critical discussions on how to improve them and how to strengthen the capacities of higher education professionals in Pakistan.\nThe project activities will continue in fall this year, with specific trainings planned for instructors of these courses. These trainings will cover a variety of topics, ranging from handling climate data to employing qualitative methods for the study of climate change.",
