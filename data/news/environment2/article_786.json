    "text": "site.btaDirectorate of Persina Nature Park Awarded Living Danube Prize for 2024 Persina Nature Park Directorate is the winner of the shared first Living Danube prize for 2024. The award is presented by the Danube Natural Heritage Foundation, Neuburg, Germany every two years. This was announced on Friday by Daniela Karakasheva, chief expert for Biodiversity and Education Programmes at the park. The prize is presented for the third time by the Danube Natural Heritage Foundation. It has a total value of EUR 15,000. The winner also receives a gold-plated medal with an image of a tern. The award is given to projects contributing to nature conservation along the Danube. For the year 2024, the first place is shared between two finalists - Persina Nature Park and the Association for Nature Conservation in Bavaria - District Organization Deggendorf, Germany. \"The Living Danube\" is an international recognition of the Park's efforts. It provides an opportunity to forge new links with a range of stakeholders and also opportunities to share best practice. The award will be directed towards the implementation of conservation activities that have been carried out by the Persina NP Directorate for more than 23 years,\" Karakasheva added. /RY/ news.modal.header news.modal.text",
