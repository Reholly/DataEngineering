    "text": "‘We had to’: Trash Pandas’ fans show up on Fourth of July despite the heat MADISON CO., Ala. ( [WAFF](http://www.waff.com/)) - On Independence Day temperatures hit a blistering 98 degrees with a feels like temperature of 107. Despite this heat, Rocket City Trash Pandas fans still showed up to Toyota Field which saw a near sellout crowd. “Nothing more American than coming down here in the sweltering heat,” Lequita Craig, a Trash Pandas fan said. But why would fans brave the heat just for a baseball game? “Cause it’s baseball. National pastime, 4th of July,” Craig said. It wasn’t just the hot dogs, beer, and baseball that brought people out. It was what happened after the game...the fireworks. “Fireworks. It’s America’s past time. You can’t have the 4th of July and not have baseball,” Amy Harvel, a Trash Pandas fan said.
