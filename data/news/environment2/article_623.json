    "text": "SPARTANBURG â€” The Flying Biscuit Cafe has announced plans to open a new location in downtown Spartanburg this fall.\nServing southern-inspired food,\nFlying Biscuit is scheduled to open its Spartanburg location at 121 W. Main St., in the building that formerly housed The Tulip Tree restaurant. The Tulip Tree closed in early 2024 after nearly four years in business.\nFounded in 1993, Flying Biscuit has 34 locations in Georgia, North Carolina, Texas, South Carolina, Florida and Alabama. In 2019, it opened a location in\nGreenville's West End neighborhood. It also has locations in Columbia and Charlotte. The restaurant's popular menu items include pancake tacos, egg-stravaganza, hangover hash, and strawberry cheesecake stuffed French toast.\nIts breakfast and lunch menus are served all day.\nSpartanburg's downtown continues to draw interest with new restaurant openings.\nIsla's On The Square, an upscale seafood restaurant, opened July 2 at 113 N. Church St. Owner Brian Greene said more restaurant openings are likely in 2024 and 2025 as the city continues to grow and attract new visitors downtown.\nIn April,\nMain Street Pub at 252 W. Main St. reopened after completing renovations to expand the business. It's among businesses hoping to gain more customers when Spartanburg's new downtown baseball stadium Fifth Third Park opens in April 2025.\nSpartanburg Mayor Jerome Rice anticipates the area's economic growth to continue. He expects restaurants downtown to benefit with the opening of the new stadium as well.\n\"The new oyster bar is an added attraction to what we already have downtown,\" Rice said. \"It's an exciting time in Spartanburg to see all of the growth. Our restaurants are all different and reach everyone and bring people downtown.\"\nPeople coming downtown want to continue to have more dining options.\n\"The more options we have the better,\" Spartanburg City Councilwoman Erica Brown said, who attended Isla's On The Square's soft opening. \"People are looking for more options rather than just bar food. Isla's brings us a whole new feel of casual dining that is something unique and we don't have in any other parts of the city.\"\nBrown added, \"The Flying Biscuit is going to be great because there's not a lot of breakfast options downtown right now. It's going to be a great addition and increase foot traffic.\"",
