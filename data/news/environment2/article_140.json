    "text": "Despite Electric Vehicles (EVs) becoming more prevalent on our roads, for many Australians the price tag still remains much too high, particularly given the current cost-of-living climate. But in a bid to persuade more motorists to purchase the EVs, which offer a host of financial and environmental benefits, some states are offering big rebates to make the vehicles more financially attractive. Below is a list of the current EV rebates being offered in each state: Know the news with the 7NEWS app: [Download today ](https://7news.com.au/app?utm_source=7NEWS&utm_medium=contextual-link-app&utm_campaign=7news-app) Queensland Queensland’s Zero Emission Vehicle Rebate Scheme offers up to $6000 for residents who purchase a new EV. To be eligible, the EV cannot be worth more than $68,000, and it had to have been purchased on or after April 21, 2023. The person purchasing the car must also have an annual total household taxable income equal to or less than $180,000. The rebate also applies to cars worth up to $58,000 purchased between March 16, 2022 and April 20, 2023, with a total household taxable income equal to or less than $180,000 a year. A $3000 rebate is available for EVs worth up to $68,000 bought on or after April 21, 2023 or EVs valued up to $58,000 bought between March 16, 2022 and April 20, 2023. Queensland businesses are ineligible to receive the $6000 rebate but may still be eligible for the $3000 rebate. More information can be found on the Queensland Government’s [website](https://www.qrida.qld.gov.au/program/queensland-zero-emission-vehicle-rebate-scheme). Victoria In Victoria, vehicles classified as ZLEVs — low-emissions cars that require electrical plug-in to recharge — receive $100 off their [annual registration](https://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/registration/registration-fees/concessions-and-discounts/hybrid-vehicle-registration-discount). The state government did offer a $3000 rebate on eligible EVs with a retail price up to $68,740 however it was scrapped in June 2023 as part of cost-cutting measures. New South Wales New South Wales also once offered a $3000 rebate on eligible EVs less than $68,750 however the incentive ended in December 2023. Instead, the state government promised to invest an additional $260 million into EV charging infrastructure. South Australia The South Australian Government axed its $3000 EV rebate at the start of 2024 however a three-year registration exemption for electric vehicles still remains. New battery electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles registered worth up to $68,750 and registered from October 28, 2021 to June 30, 2025 are eligible. The exemption applies for three years from the date the vehicle is first registered. For more information, visit the state’s Department of Treasury and Finance [website](https://www.treasury.sa.gov.au/Growing-South-Australia/incentives-for-electric-vehicles). Western Australia Residents in WA can receive a $3500 rebate under the [Government’s Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) Rebate Scheme](https://www.transport.wa.gov.au/projects/zero-emission-vehicle-zev-rebate.asp). Zero emission vehicles that are fully powered by batteries or hydrogen fuel cells and are worth $70,000 or less are eligible. Hybrid vehicles are not entitled to the rebate. Since the introduction of the scheme in May 2022, almost 7000 rebates have been paid totalling $24,000,000 (as of May 31, 2024). Northern Territory Free registration and stamp duty concessions for eligible plug-in electric vehicles are [available for NT residents](https://nt.gov.au/driving/rego/getting-an-nt-registration/get-electric-vehicle-registration-and-stamp-duty-concessions). For electric vehicles valued up to $50,000, a stamp duty concession of up to $1500 is on offer. Battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles are eligible. Australian Capital Territory Lower registration fees are available for some low-emissions vehicles in the ACT. Certain electric vehicles also receive a stamp duty exemption. Zero emissions vehicles were eligible for two years of free registration, however the incentive finished in June 2024. There are interest-free loans of up to $15,000 available for homeowners to purchase sustainable products for their home, including new and used zero emissions vehicles vehicle charging equipment. More details can be found on the [government’s website](https://www.accesscanberra.act.gov.au/driving-transport-and-parking/registration/incentives-for-low-and-zero-emissions-vehicles). Tasmania Tasmania has an [Electric Vehicle Rebate program](https://www.recfit.tas.gov.au/what_is_recfit/climate_change/electric_vehicles/support?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR3ODeJC3qj-0tAAfMFKQ_p2gCrZiLetcbP7QEtB9yJ2qkATWNLMSfub69g_aem_Bp97bTYoN6mAo_l-3pfA1w) which offers a limited number of rebates of $2000 for new battery electric vehicles and second-hand electric vehicles. The majority of the rebates have been reserved, however some funding is still available where applicants have taken too long to buy their cars (more than six months). The state government will allocate these rebates to another applicant. As of July 1, 2024 there are 28 rebates available. The rebates will be re-released at 11am every Tuesday until funding has been exhausted. Rebates are not guaranteed to everyone who applies. Stream free on",
