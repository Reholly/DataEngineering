    "text": "Fota Wildlife Park has announced the arrival of three endangered Asiatic lion cubs – the first lion births at the park since 2019.\nThe cubs were born to mother Arya, a six-year-old lion who was part of the first cub litter to be born at Fota and who recently returned from Helsinki Zoo.\nShe was paired with the male lion Yali, who is the most genetically significant Asiatic lion in the European Breeding Programme.\nThe cubs were born on June 5th, with Yali present for the birth. Lead ranger Julien Fonteneau said: “We are overjoyed with the birth of Arya's cubs.\n“Arya and Yali’s cubs are not just vital to our breeding programme but also to the global efforts in preserving the Asiatic lion population.\n“In a first for Fota Wildlife Park, Yali was present at the birth of his three cubs, normally the male lions would not attend the birth of their young. One of our team members here quipped that Yali is a very modern father!”\nThe International Union of Conservation of Nature classes the Asiatic lion as endangered, with the species found in only one remaining site in the world, the Gir Forest in India. The population there is estimated to be about 500 to 600 lions.\nThe birth of the cubs brings the number of Asiatic lions in Fota to seven. Fonteneau said: “Arya’s journey has been remarkable. Born and raised at Fota Wildlife Park, she spent a few years at Helsinki Zoo, but was eventually ousted by the other lionesses.\n“Earlier this year, Arya returned to her roots at Fota to live with her mother, Gira, and her aunt, Gita. Now, she has continued the lineage of Asiatic lions at Fota Wildlife Park. Her mate, Yali, who joined Fota in the summer of 2022, is a crucial figure in the European Breeding Programme due to the rarity of his DNA.”\nFota Wildlife Park is calling on the public to help name the three male cubs – with annual Conservation passes up for grabs for the winners.
