    "text": "PHIST strikes again with Southeast Asia’s biggest sustainable tourism event PHIST ( [Phuket](https://thethaiger.com/news/phuket) Hotels for Islands Sustaining Tourism), Southeast Asia’s biggest sustainability event for the travel and hospitality sectors, will return to spark conversation and drive the green agenda this September, with an impressive line-up of key figures and industry innovators led by Peng Sum Choe, CEO of Pan Pacific Hotels Group. Organised by the [Phuket Hotels Association](https://www.phukethotelsassociation.com/), the non-profit organisation of hoteliers focused on creating a bright future for Phuket, PHIST 2024 will run under the theme One on One: Sustainability from the Top, as it reveals how senior company executives can successfully build a forward-thinking corporate culture and drive positive change, not only within their own companies but across the entire industry and beyond. Headlining this year’s event will be Peng Sum Choe, CEO of Pan Pacific Hotels Group, who has guided his company towards integrating sustainability into every aspect of its operations. This has led to the group achieving Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC) Multi-Site certification for all eight of its properties in Singapore. He will come together with Jesper Palmqvist, Senior Director – Asia Pacific for hospitality analysts STR, to discuss the critical issue of green leadership. Also driving the conversation will be Jayne MacDougall, Executive Director of the Phuket Hotels Association, who will reveal the details of the Green Planet School Farm Project – an important initiative that is empowering the next generation of organic producers. Staged at Angsana Laguna Phuket in Phuket on 2 September 2024, PHIST is not just another conference; it is a highly immersive and interactive learning event that will feature a series of candid debates and discussions, 18 workshops, career development sessions and networking opportunities that will encourage attendees to confront conventional thinking and create meaningful solutions to a range of environmental and community-focused challenges. Last year’s conference was attended by more than 1,000 people. “I am grateful for the opportunity to address my industry colleagues at PHIST. Sustainability is a crucial issue, particularly for island communities, making this event an important platform for collaboration. I look forward to sharing my experiences and learning from the innovative solutions and insights of others,” said Peng Sum Choe, CEO of Pan Pacific Hotels Group. “We are thrilled to announce Peng Sum Choe and Jesper Palmqvist as our headline speakers; they will provide the perfect blend of expertise and insight to inspire guests to create sustainable futures for their own businesses,” said Jayne MacDougall, Executive Director, Phuket Hotels Association.
