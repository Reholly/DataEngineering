    "text": "A Bittersweet Rediscovery of the Rarest Kangaroo Alive In the dense, emerald heart of the Wondiwoi Mountains, in [West Papua](https://palmoildetectives.com/tag/west-papua/) the trees echo with the haunting refrains of the vogelkop superb bird-of-paradise. Underfoot, the ground is soggy and dense with mossy herbaceous fragrances and the scuttling of an eastern long-beaked echidna as she burrows into her subterranean domain. In 2018, an extraordinary moment was captured forever on camera in 2018. High in the treetops, amidst the thick moss-covered branches, a shy Wondiwoi tree kangaroo lay in quiet repose, a symbol of sturdy, plump beauty. This creature was believed to be extinct for nearly a century. Yet a chance encounter by British amateur botanist Michael Smith in 2018 has thrust this creature back into the spotlight. Wondiwoi tree kangaroos Dendrolagus mayri have an odd combination of kangaroo and monkey qualities. Large and soulful eyes blink from behind long eyelashes and thickly furred paddle-like arms culminate in strong sharp claws fit for grasping tree branches. Their bodies are the colour of burnt umber and terracotta and embody the tranquillity of Papua’s majestic montane forests where they blend into the painter’s palette of the jungle. Smith’s serendipitous discovery of Wondiwoi tree kangaroos, known as the world’s rarest and most endangered kangaroo, highlights their precarious existence due to human-related threats like palm oil deforestation, rare mineral mining and hunting throughout their range. A Journey Fuelled by Passion and Curiosity Michael Smith is an amateur botanist from England. He spends a lot of his free time traversing remote locations like [Indonesia](https://palmoildetectives.com/tag/indonesia/), Pakistan and Kurdistan in the faint hope of encountering the rarest species on earth. “I want these animals to be the poster children for seriously threatened and ancient habitats. I’m trying to get evidence of something interesting – and in terms of getting people involved and excited about conservation, it seems to be effective.” He understands that time is of the essence to save these animals and many others from the relentless growth of palm oil deforestation. It’s hard to know if things will change fast enough for there to be anything left. In the 1990s, Papua New Guinea was just a big forest, with a few people. Now it’s still 80% or 90% forest, but there is huge pressure from people and investors who want to make palm oil.” Video Credit: [Palm Oil Detectives](https://youtu.be/1pzwtverGhU?si=d92OgCXSbUzrRsk1) The Enigmatic Wondiwoi Tree Kangaroo The bittersweet rediscovery of the Wondiwoi tree kangaroo underscores their gravely precarious position as the rarest kangaroo in the world. Originally they were discovered in 1928 by Ernst Mayer and known only by a single specimen. Papuan non-profit Tenkile Conservation Alliance estimates that less than 50 individuals remain alive. The Wondiwoi tree kangaroo’s habitat is under severe threat from [palm oil deforestation](https://palmoildetectives.com/category/news/the-problems-with-palm-oil/palm-oil-deforestation-fires-ecocide/) and the extraction of rare minerals such as mica and [gold](https://palmoildetectives.com/tag/boycott-gold/). The forests of West Papua, once a haven for diverse wildlife, are being decimated in silence. The Guardians of the Forest The survival of the Wondiwoi tree kangaroo is intricately linked to the sovereignty, and land stewardship of the [Papuan indigenous peoples](https://palmoildetectives.com/2022/08/09/anthropologist-and-author-of-in-the-shadow-of-the-palms-dr-sophie-chao-in-her-own-words/). Their deep spiritual and ancestral connection to the land and its human and more-than-human inhabitants stands in stark contrast to the destructive policies of the colonialist Indonesian government. Conservation efforts must prioritise indigenous rights and knowledge, recognising that true protection of these animals lies in the hands of those who have lived in harmony with the forest for many millennia. [Tenkile Conservation Alliance](https://tenkile.com/saving-tree-kangaroos/) have a range of programmes helping indigenous peoples to understand the importance of conserving rather than hunting tree kangaroos and providing them with ways to harvest alternative sources of food. They have developed tree kangaroo hunting moratoriums as well alongside village communities. The Jungle Kingdom of Dendrolagus: Tree Kangaroos The [genus Dendrolagus](https://palmoildetectives.com/?s=dendrolagus), more enchantingly known as tree kangaroos, embody arboreal grace and irresistible chubby cuteness. These [marsupials](https://palmoildetectives.com/tag/marsupial/) are lesser known than their iconic ground-dwelling cousins further south in Australia and possess a range of distinctive traits making them masters of the jungle canopy. Their exceptionally long, pendulous tails act as elegant counterbalances, helping with every leap and bound. Strong forelimbs, paired with shorter and broader hind feet, provide them with superior strength and agility. Long curved claws and spongy paws enhance grip, like natural bouldering shoes, allowing them to climb and cling effortlessly to branches. Females possess a forward-opening pouch (marsupium) containing four teats. These provide a nurturing haven for their developing young. Their teeth are adapted for shearing leaves, reveal their dietary preference for the verdant foliage of the treetops.

Taking Action: How You Can Help Take action by using your wallet as a weapon #Boycottpalmoil #Boycott4Wildlife The rediscovery of the Wondiwoi tree kangaroo underscores the urgent need for consumer action. Here’s how you can make a difference: - Boycott Palm Oil: Reject RSPO greenwashing and avoid products containing “sustainable” palm oil. Use your purchasing power to demand palm oil free in the supermarket. Join the [#Boycottpalmoil and #Boycott4Wildlife](https://x.com/PalmOilDetect)movement on social media. - Raise Awareness: [Share posts on social media](https://x.com/PalmOilDetect)and engage in supermarket sleuthing to expose brands that use palm oil. Highlight the ongoing deforestation and animal cruelty. - Support Indigenous Sovereignty: Advocate for the rights and sovereignty of Papuan indigenous peoples, recognising their crucial role in conserving rainforest habitats and as guardians of rare species. - Donate: Support the [ongoing advocacy of Palm Oil Detectives](https://ko-fi.com/palmoildetectives)and the non-profit [Tenkile Conservation Alliance](https://tenkile.com/), who work tirelessly to protect indigenous peoples, endangered species and their environments. - Get Involved: Participate in local and global conservation efforts. Whether through social media activism, community education, or direct action, every effort counts. By taking these steps, you can help ensure that the Wondiwoi tree kangaroo and other [endangered species in Papua](https://palmoildetectives.com/2021/01/26/papua-new-guinea/) have a fighting chance to survive and thrive. The fight to protect the Wondiwoi tree kangaroo is a testament to the resilience of nature and the enduring spirit of people all over the world who strive to safeguard it. Together, we can shine a light on the darkness of deforestation and exploitation, ensuring a brighter future for these remarkable creatures and their forest home. Further Reading Pickrell, J. (2018).
