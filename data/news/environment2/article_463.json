    "text": "Nearly 1,000 AXA volunteers engaged in restoration and biodiversity efforts\nHONG KONG , July 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- AXA Hong Kong and Macau (\"AXA\") celebrated its \"Week for Good 2024\", AXA's annual global volunteer service campaign dedicated to sustainability. This year, the event centered on water and environment. Around 1,000 employees and financial consultants participated in a series of impactful activities, including coastal cleanup, upcycling workshops, which were aimed at raising awareness on the importance of clean water and advocating for the preservation of Hong Kong's marine ecosystem. Timed to coincide with World Environment Day on June 5th , these activities align with AXA's new climate strategy and commitments, reinforcing the company's efforts to combat climate change and enhance clean water and sanitation initiatives.\nAround 300 AXA volunteers, including AXA employees, financial consultants and their families, participated in the coastal cleanup in Shui Hau Wan, successfully clearing over 500kg of waste.\nWater is essential for human existence. As human population continues to grow, fresh water has become a globally scarce resource. Exacerbated by climate change, extreme weather events such as floods, droughts, landslides, and hailstorms present an escalating threat to global water resources. Among all natural disasters, 90% are water-related or have an impact on water resources[1]. By 2030, it is estimated that there will be a 40% deficit[2] in available freshwater resources. To address these challenges, it will require immediate action to educate the current and future generations about preserving this vital resource.",
