    "text": "Prince Edward Island is getting a new national park reserve thanks to an agreement signed this week. The creation of\nPituamkek National Park Reserve will be the first national park reserve to contribute to Canada’s commitment to create 10 new national parks by 2026.\nComprised of a chain of barrier islands in northwestern PEI, the lands of Pituamkek (bee-DOO-um-gek) form one of the most ecologically significant coastal dune ecosystems in eastern Canada and hold great cultural and historical significance for the Epekwitnewaq Mi’kmaq, the Mi’kmaq of Epekwitk and island residents.\nThe archipelago also helps mitigate the impacts of extreme weather events on coastal communities, as seen during Hurricane Fiona in September 2022. The Traveler got\na private preview of the island near the Lennox Island First Nation in northwestern PEI in June 2022. This will be Canada's 48th national park.\nThe establishment agreement was announced Thursday by Mi’kmawey Kapmnt Ta’n Nikana’tu’tij Epekwitnewaq Mi’kmaw-Saqmaq — the Mi’kmaw Nation Government of Prince Edward Island (as represented by the Prince Edward Island Chiefs), Chief Darlene Bernard of Lennox Island First Nation, Chief Junior Gould of Abegweit First Nation, and Steven Guilbeault, Minister of Environment and Climate Change and Minister responsible for Parks Canada.\nPituamkek — “At the Long Sand Dune” — is home to ancient and continuing Mi’kmaw land-use traditions, important cultural and archaeological sites, rare and sensitive ecosystems, and unique geological formations. It boasts coastal dune systems, old-growth forests and PEI’s only igneous rock incursion.\nThe agreement lays out key elements of the future park reserve, such as a co-management governance model, guardian programming, community-based employment opportunities, and commitments for net-zero, climate smart infrastructure development. It builds on Canada’s commitment to reconciliation with Indigenous peoples and a renewed government-to-government relationship with the Epekwitnewaq Mi’kmaq.\nThe work on assembling the park reserve lands is an ongoing partnership between L‘nuey, Parks Canada, Island Nature Trust, the Nature Conservancy of Canada and the Province of Prince Edward Island. The Mi’kmaq Epekwitnewaq Kapmntemuow has led the way in initiating and continuously advocating for the establishment of this park reserve since the beginning of this process in 2006.\nParks Canada explains that a national park reserve is an area that is managed like a national park but is subject to one or more Indigenous land claims. These land claims are being negotiated between the federal and Indigenous governments. Indigenous peoples continue to use the land for traditional hunting, fishing and trapping.",
