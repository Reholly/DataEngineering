    "text": "This month is Plastic Free July, a global movement to minimize plastic waste. Plastic Free July is all about taking small steps to reduce our use of single-use plastic and keep plastic trash out of our ecosystems and waterways. This month and beyond, try these 10 easy plastic-free swaps to minimize your plastic use in the [kitchen](https://bestreviews.com/articles/kitchen/knives/are-plastic-cutting-boards-safe), [house cleaning](https://bestrevie.ws/007f59ba1bc74cc0c46f9aa4f051de875cc9fa54-MDcyMDI0/73?cbid=71597&r=https%3A%2F%2Fiherb.prf.hn%2Fclick%2Fcamref%3A1011lffhn%2Fpubref%3A007f59ba1bc74cc0c46f9aa4f051de875cc9fa54-MDcyMDI0%2Fdestination%3Ahttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.iherb.com%252Fpr%252Fif-you-care-reusable-sponge-cloths-5-clothes-8-x-6-75-20-cm-x-17-cm-each%252F104947), [running errands](https://bestrevie.ws/B0BWGJ3HQG/007f59ba1bc74cc0c46f9aa4f051de875cc9fa54-MDcyMDI0) and more. In this article: [Stasher Platinum Silicone Food-Grade Reusable Storage Bag, ](https://bestrevie.ws/B01DZQT99I/007f59ba1bc74cc0c46f9aa4f051de875cc9fa54-MDcyMDI0?lid=193144) [Grove Co. Multipurpose Cleaner Refill Concentrate](https://bestrevie.ws/B0BT74Z5YB/007f59ba1bc74cc0c46f9aa4f051de875cc9fa54-MDcyMDI0) and [Iron Flask Co-Pilot Insulated Mug with Straw and Flip-Cap Lids](https://bestrevie.ws/B0CW676ZGY/007f59ba1bc74cc0c46f9aa4f051de875cc9fa54-MDcyMDI0) Plastic Free July was founded as a grassroots campaign in 2011 and has since evolved into a global movement, with millions of individuals pledging their participation. It's estimated that 2021's Plastic Free July eliminated more than 2 million tons of plastic waste. As consumers become more aware of the dangers of [microplastics](https://bestreviews.com/articles/health-and-wellness/digestion/how-to-avoid-consuming-microplastics) and the threat plastic trash poses to Earth's oceans, pressure is growing on manufacturers to reduce their introduction of petroleum-based fabrics, including polyester and nylon, as well as their reliance on plastic packaging. Individual consumers can also do their part by educating themselves on plastic pollution, recycling and alternatives to single-use plastics. Try some of these ideas as part of your Plastic Free July pledge: Ultimately, we as consumers can use Plastic Free July as a way to implement small changes that can establish better habits. However, our impact as individuals is always going to be tiny compared to the plastic waste generated by companies. In fact, research has found that about 50 companies are responsible for more than half of the branded plastic found in the environment. Plus, single-use plastics play an important role in some settings and for people with accessibility needs, so they can't be eliminated entirely without some major systemic changes. To make your Plastic Free July pledge go farther, spend some time this month contacting your representatives to pressure companies and manufacturers to reduce their reliance on plastic, especially plastic packaging. Ask your local government to model sustainable behaviors to set a good example for the wider community.
