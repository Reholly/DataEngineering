    "text": "100 New Public E-charging Stations Nationwide\nMore than 100 new public e-charging stations outside the capital can be established nationwide, thanks to a HUF 28 billion subsidy opportunity scheduled to open in August, the Ministry of Energy Affairs announced in a statement on its Facebook page.\nThe program launched for social consultation also encourages the installation of modern charging points equipped with solar panels and energy storage.\n\"Hungary is striving for a leading role in its production and storage in homes, industrial sites and also in vehicles,\" the post reads.\n\"Electric cars can be used without air pollution, they are quieter than those powered by an internal combustion engine, and their operators can save on operating and maintenance costs.\nThe related job-creating industrial developments promote the restoration of economic growth and the strengthening of competitiveness,\" the ministry said.\nSUPPORT THE BUDAPEST BUSINESS JOURNAL\nProducing journalism that is worthy of the name is a costly business. For 27 years, the publishers, editors and reporters of the Budapest Business Journal have striven to bring you business news that works, information that you can trust, that is factual, accurate and presented without fear or favor.\nNewspaper organizations across the globe have struggled to find a business model that allows them to continue to excel, without compromising their ability to perform. Most recently, some have experimented with the idea of involving their most important stakeholders, their readers.\nWe would like to offer that same opportunity to our readers. We would like to invite you to help us deliver the quality business journalism you require.
