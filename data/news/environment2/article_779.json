The museum was partially inaugurated in August 2015, with only a few sections accessible to the public. These initial sections included a children's museum, the main entrance area, and an orientation theatre. The remaining galleries were opened to the public in October 2017, showcasing a rich collection of artefacts. Over 100 historical artefacts were carefully transferred to the Bihar Museum from the Patna Museum. The vision for this museum was to create a comprehensive history museum for the state of Bihar. The construction started in October 2013 on Bailey Road, Patna with a significant budget of â‚¹498 crore. The museum complex is spread across an area of 13.9 acres, providing a good space for its various exhibits, galleries, and facilities. The Bihar Museum has an impressive placement of galleries which showcase a unique aspect of the state's rich cultural heritage. The various galleries include an Orientation gallery, a children's gallery, a regional gallery, a contemporary gallery, a historical art gallery, a Bihari Diaspora gallery, and a visible storage gallery. Each of these spacious galleries is dedicated to a specific theme, displaying a vast collection of artefacts, some of which date back to the fourth century. The exhibits are made and presented in a detailed way that is both informative and engaging, allowing visitors to immerse in the history, art, and culture of Bihar. Trending Photos",
