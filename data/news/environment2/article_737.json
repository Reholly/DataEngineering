    "text": "The Young Farmers Challenge (YFC) Program of the Philippine Department of Agriculture is an annual competitive financial grant assistance that aims to attract Filipino youth. YPC provides access to capital to enable young people to venture into profitable agriculture, agri-fishery, and agribusiness as well as business development assistance, Since its launch in 2021, the YFC program has supported over 3,625 beneficiaries operating various agribusiness enterprises. The young are not encouraged to go into the agriculture sector mainly because they see farmers remaining poor despite working daily, according to Philippine Senator Imee Marcos. She added the importance of programs that make farming more attractive to them or we will continue to lose workers in the agriculture sector.
