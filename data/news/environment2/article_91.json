    "text": "The Sindh government on Thursday successfully installed a 2310 kilowatt solar power generation system at Dow Medical Hospital (Ojha Campus) and a 245.16 kilowatt system at the Sindh Government Hospital, Liaquatabad. Sindh Provincial Energy Minister Syed Nasir Hussain Shah visited both hospitals on Thursday to inspect the newly installed solar systems. Accompanying him were Tariq Ali Shah, Managing Director of Thar Coal Energy Board, and Mahfouz Qazi, Director of Solar Energy. The total construction cost for these solar systems in both hospitals amounted to US $1.3 million. Minister Shah highlighted that these projects are expected to save Rs 187.11 million annually and would remain operational for 25 years. Regarding the solar system at the Sindh Government Hospital, Liaquatabad, Shah noted its capacity of 245.16 kilowatts, estimating an annual saving of Rs 26.7 million. He mentioned that last year, this system generated 594,092.81 units of electricity. Shah underscored that these initiatives align with Chairman Bilawal Bhutto's vision for public welfare projects across the province. The solarisation of government buildings not only contributes to cost savings but also reduces the burden on the government.",
