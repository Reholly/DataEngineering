Its goal is to compensate victims and avoid injury by holding responsible parties accountable. Torts may be criminal or civil.\nMost legal systems provide ample protection for the life, limbs, and property of a person.

Civil damages are designed to put the person who was injured back to the same position as if she had not been injured by the act of negligence. Damages are categorized as either general or specific.
