    "text": "Source: NPRJuly 4, 2024 4:00 PM ET The summer has already been a scorcher and heat alerts across the country could lead to more records broken. Public housing residents, many elderly, children or sick, are disproportionately vulnerable to heat illness, yet theres no federal mandate to provide them air conditioning. In fact, until last month the Department of Housing and Urban Development allowed local housing agencies to subsidize tenants heating bills, but with some exceptions explicitly said they could not pay for cooling bills. New guidance changes that, though critics say it still falls short. We must protect the health and safety of our families during increasingly severe weather events, like extreme heat, that can cause grave harm and even death to any member of our community, said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman in a statement announcing the change last month. Several public housing residents were among the hundreds who died when a heat wave struck the Pacific Northwest in 2021. Last year, Portland public housing resident Beth Vansmith told NPR she remembers how awful she felt at that time, with no air conditioner and temperatures soaring up to 116. \"I would get dizzy. I would get nauseous. You know, I'd lose my appetite completely, and it was just so miserably hot,\" she said. Much public housing was built before central air was common, and at a time when it was not necessary in many parts of the country. Yet even as climate-fueled heat waves grow more intense and frequent, public housing residents who want an AC unit must buy it themselves. And some who do often hesitate to use it because of the added cost to their electric bill. Now, local housing agencies will be allowed to subsidize cooling costs during a severe heat period.
