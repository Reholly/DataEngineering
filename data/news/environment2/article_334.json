    "text": "Sankeien in Yokohama’s southeastern side is a traditional Japanese garden with an inviting atmosphere perfect for welcoming the change of the seasons. Getting to the garden from Yokosuka Naval Base is about a 40-minute drive. The garden was built back in 1906 by Japanese industrialist Hara Sankei. The riverside garden spreads 175,000 square meters, has a large pond and dozens of centuries-old buildings. Some of the structures on the grounds, including a samurai residence, pagoda and teahouses, have earned the garden a National Scenic Spot designation. These buildings were relocated from Kyoto, Kamakura, Shirakawago and other cities around Japan. Among the historic buildings at the garden, 10 are National Cultural Properties and three are Tangible Cultural Properties. As my family and I strolled the garden recently, we enjoyed the vintage look of the buildings. Geese in the pond seemed to be enjoying their peaceful surroundings as we continued our exploration of Sankeien. From the Shofukaku observation deck and around the three-storied pagoda, we got an overview of the extensive grounds and its contrast to the nearby industrial complex and busy Yokohama City. Sankeien is an ideal garden to unwind from your busy work schedule and melt away some of rainy season blues. Head on over and welcome the season with a refreshing stroll around the garden. Sankeien Garden Location: 58-1 Honmoku Sannotani, Naka-ku, Yokohama City, Kanagawa Pref. Hours: 9 a.m. – 5 p.m. Admission: ages 15 or older, 900 yen; elementary and middle schoolers, 200 yen Tel: 045-621-0634",
