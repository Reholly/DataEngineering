    "text": "The Nigerian Bottling Company has restated its commitment to environmental sustainability by taking its tree planting initiative to six states and the Federal Capital Territory.\nIn a release, the brewer stated that it took the national tree planting programme to Lagos, Edo, Imo, Oyo States and the FCT to commemorate World Environment Day.\nIt added that the environmental initiative, centred around the theme of ‘Land Restoration, Desertification, and Drought Resilience’, saw NBC organise roadshows, rallies, lectures, and symposiums to raise awareness about the benefits of tree planting and its positive impact on climate change.\nThe NBC National Environment Manager, Temitope Ogunrinde, said the company prioritised environmental sustainability as a means to provide lasting solutions to the climate change crisis affecting Nigerian communities, and the planet due to land degradation, environmental hazards, food insecurity, and the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services.\nNBC’s Lagos campaign partnered with the Lagos State Parks and Gardens Agency, Lagos Waste Management Authority and Hope for Life Initiative to engage Oregun High School in Lagos to sensitise students on the importance of annual tree planting.\nOgunrinde encouraged the Oregun High School students to nurture and protect the newly planted trees and ensure they benefit current and future generations.\nHe said, “Through our partnerships with the government and related agencies, private organisations, and our in-house sustainability initiatives, we will continue to curb environmental pollution and effect positive change nationwide.”\nLAWMA’s MD, Muyiwa Gbadegeshin, represented by Victor Adedeji, emphasised the initiative’s role in providing students with practical tree-planting experience and raising climate change awareness.\nThe Assistant Director of LASPARK’s Tree Planting and Maintenance Department, Adebimpe Kuponu, also underscored the importance of ongoing tree-planting efforts in environmental preservation.\nThe NBC integrated local communities into the environmental solutions, encouraging Oyo State residents to participate in gardening activities to combat desertification.\nThe company donated tree seedlings in Benin, Edo State and organised a community cleanup exercise, while in Owerri, Imo State, it conducted a nature walk to emphasize land restoration measures aimed at protecting the environment from drought.\nAt the University of Lagos, the company collaborated with Coca-Cola to host an environmental sustainability challenge at the first anniversary of the Green Eco Hub.\nAccording to NBC, 1.5 million plastic bottles were recovered in the environmental sustainability challenge.",
