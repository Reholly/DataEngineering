    "text": "Berry farms thriving despite recent heat wave SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (WGGB/WSHM) - Blueberry picking season is in full swing and local berry farms around western Mass are working hard to ensure every visitor experiences the joy of picking the best blueberries they can find. Whether you’re a seasoned berry picker or a first timer, right now is the perfect opportunity to take part in this year’s blueberry picking season. Western Mass News stopped by the Pie in the Sky Berry Farm in Northampton where they told us thanks to plenty of rainfall last year, the blueberries are thriving, with several different varieties for customers to choose from. “This year it’s been fantastic. Actually, the blueberries really loved all the rain we got last year so you know as farmers we rely on whatever mother nature has to offer up to us, so we just adapt to whether it’s a drought or whether it’s rain and we just hope people come out here and enjoy this organic fruit,” Kristen Sykes, vice president of marketing and communication at Pie in the Sky Berry Farm. She highlighted that their 8.5-acre farmland is protected by the state, so it is important for them to embrace all organic farming methods to help keep a sustainable environment for not only their crops but also for the diverse wildlife that call this land home. “So, we have planted a lot of things for pollinators and for birds so because we’re on the Connecticut River it’s a really important fly way, it’s a part of the Silvio O. Conte National Fish and Wildlife Refuge and so we have so many different bird species and then we have dragonflies and fireflies. And because of our organic practices, and we really treat the soil well, we’re really almost like a habitat for wildlife in addition to a habitat for people to come and pick fruit,” she explained. Sykes said people are usually surprised to know that this farm exists in Northampton, located behind the fairgrounds and I-91. She said they always want to ensure people from all over western Mass are able to come out and be able to spend time in nature while also picking sweet, organic fruit at a reasonable price. “So, it’s 8 dollars a quart and they’re all organic and we intentionally make sure that our prices are affordable for people, whether it’s the blueberries, the strawberries, or the flowers because we really want to make sure that people have access to fresh local food.” So, right now, we are in the height of blueberry season and Pie in the Sky Berry Farm will have several varieties of ripe organic blueberries available for the next two weeks.
