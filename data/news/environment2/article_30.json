    "text": "PRESIDENT Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. has committed long-term aid for agricultural workers who were affected by El Niño in Eastern Visayas, with the completion of key infrastructure projects.\nOn Thursday, the chief executive visited Calbayog City in Samar and Palo in Leyte to lead in the distribution of over P136.30 million worth of government aid to the El Niño-affected farmers and fisherfolks.\nThe droughts and dry spell caused by El Niño affected 504 farmers in Samar, Biliran and Leyte and caused agricultural losses of P23 million.\nMarcos said the new infrastructures are expected to help improve transportation and living conditions in the region providing better opportunities for agriculture.\nIn Samar, he said the ongoing infrastructure projects are the repairs on the Maharlika Highway, which is set to be completed next year, as well as the construction of the Basey-Marabut-Pinamitinan Road, Wright-Taft Borongan Road, and the Catbalogan Drainage System.\nAs for Leyte, he cited the construction of the Tacloban Airport, which is expected to be finished in 2025, and the Tacloban City Causeway.\nAside from helping in the economic growth in the region, Marcos said the projects will also help end insurgent activities in Eastern Visayas.\n“We are making these efforts to encourage other rebels to convert and become a productive members of our society,” Marcos said in his speech in Calbayog City.",
