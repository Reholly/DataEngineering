    "text": "52% of Owners Interested in Increasing Energy Efficiency\nImage by Bud.hu\nMore than half of property owners (52%) are interested in home renovation projects aimed at increasing energy efficiency, according to a survey of 1,000 people commissioned by OTP Otthon and OTP Bank.\nMost people think about insulating their houses and replacing windows, but many would also invest in solar panels and heat pumps. Especially if they also receive state support.\nOn July 1, the residential home renovation subsidy was launched, thanks to which the state will provide up to HUF 6 million in the form of an interest-free loan and non-refundable subsidy for the energy modernization of family houses built before the end of 1990.\nThis aims to encourage the energy modernization of residential buildings, contributing to renovating more than 20,000 family houses.\nSome 14.3% of the costs must be self-financed, the maximum amount of the interest-free loan and the non-refundable subsidy can be HUF 6 mln, and energy savings of at least 30% must be achieved as evidenced by the renovat ion.\nSUPPORT THE BUDAPEST BUSINESS JOURNAL\nProducing journalism that is worthy of the name is a costly business. For 27 years, the publishers, editors and reporters of the Budapest Business Journal have striven to bring you business news that works, information that you can trust, that is factual, accurate and presented without fear or favor.\nNewspaper organizations across the globe have struggled to find a business model that allows them to continue to excel, without compromising their ability to perform. Most recently, some have experimented with the idea of involving their most important stakeholders, their readers.\nWe would like to offer that same opportunity to our readers. We would like to invite you to help us deliver the quality business journalism you require.
