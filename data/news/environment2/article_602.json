Bhanu Sinha, Divisional Forest Officer of the Kachugaon Forest Division, was happy with the finding. He said the park's role in conserving the Mainland Serow and its broader wildlife diversity has been commendable. More from Travel News More News The animal is scientifically known as Capricornis sumatraensis thar. It can also be found in nearby regions such as the Phibsoo Wildlife Sanctuary and Bhutan's Royal Manas National Park, suggesting potential cross-boundary conservation benefits. The discovery emphasises on the rich biodiversity of Raimona National Park. M. Firoz Ahmed, a senior scientist at Aaranyak also highlighted the Mainland Serow's extensive habitat range, from the Himalayas to Sumatra. He also stressed the urgent need for conservation due to fragmented populations and threats like poaching and habitat loss. Raimona National Park, situated in Assam's Kokrajhar district, got its status as a national park on June 5, 2021. The declaration was made by Assam's Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma during the World Environment Day celebrations at Gandhi Mandap in Guwahati. The park is a biodiversity hotspot renowned for its rich flora and fauna. It spans an area of diverse landscapes, including tropical forests, grasslands, and wetlands.
