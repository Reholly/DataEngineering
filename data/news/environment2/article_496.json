    "text": "Semcon’s climate target approved by the Science Based Target initiative\nSemcon’s climate target has now been validated and approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).\n“Semcon has a strong combination of engineering, digital and sustainability expertise, and we support our customers in the development of green technologies, the transition to net-zero and circular value chains, and much more. While our largest possibility to contribute to the shift to a net-zero society is through our customer projects, we ourselves must do what is required of all companies and organisations right now. The approval of our climate target by the SBTi validates that our commitment is in line with the 1.5°C ambition,” says Markus Granlund, CEO of Semcon.\nSemcon’s near-term science-based target, which has now been approved by the SBTi, is the following:\nSemcon commits to reduce absolute scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions 50% by 2030 from a 2019 base year.*\n*The target boundary includes biogenic land-related emissions and removals from bioenergy feedstocks.\n“Scientific reports indicate that we are likely to hit a global warming of 1.5°C already in the late 2020s or early 2030s and nearly 3°C this century, with severe societal impacts. Green energy and electrification are necessary but not sufficient. To succeed with the climate transition, we need to shift into a circular economy. It’s time to rethink business as usual. At Semcon, we can support our customers with a holistic and stepwise approach on their journey towards net-zero and circular value chains,” says Heidi Östlund, Head of Sustainability at Semcon.\nIn June 2021, Semcon committed to setting climate targets in line with the 1.5 °C ambition with the SBTi. Due to Ratos' acquisition of Semcon in 2022, Semcon's proposal for near-term target was then submitted in December 2022. The target was resubmitted in November 2023 as the Group structure changed following the divestment of Semcon’s Product Information business area (today independent company Aleido).\nSince 2021, Semcon’s overall commitment is to halve emissions by 2030 and be net-zero by 2040, with 2019 as the base year. It’s largest sources of emissions are linked to employee commuting, business travel and purchased goods and services.\nRead more about sustainability at Semcon.\nAbout the Science Based Target initiative\nThe Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) is a collaboration between CDP, the United Nations Global Compact, World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). The SBTi defines and promotes best practice in science-based target setting and independently assesses companies’ targets.
