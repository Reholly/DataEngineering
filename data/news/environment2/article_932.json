    "text": "Tourism Minister Kandula Durgesh announced the government’s plans to transform the State into a tourism hub, focusing on temple, heritage, eco, and health tourism sectors.\nSpeaking at the inauguration of a hotel run by the Andhra Pradesh State Tourism Development Corporation (APSTDC) here on Friday, he said there are plans to establish more hotels across the State which offer quality food and services to tourists.\nWhen asked about the management of APSTDC hotels, he emphasised the need for public-private partnerships (PPPs) to ensure efficient functioning and maintenance, as the government alone cannot shoulder the responsibility.\nRegarding the fund crunch issues the Corporation is facing, he stressed the importance of a strong political will to overcome such challenges.\nHe also expressed his desire to deliberate with TTD authorities about shortening the waiting time for the devotees visiting the town on APSTDC package tours.\nRead Comments Copy link Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINT",
