    "text": "Thermolysis's innovation and unique technology to recycled carbon fiber. we are not only dedicated to making innovative products but also taking responsibility for them. we promise to implement full recycling measures for all future productions, ensuring environmental integrity and promoting carbon fiber recycling. Our carbon fiber regeneration process is ISO 14067 certified, emitting only one-fifth of the carbon emissions compared to making new fiber. Carbon fiber composite materials are the go-to for lightweight applications in major industries. However, looking at the carbon footprint of producing carbon fiber raw filaments, there are two big issues. First, the high energy use in production leads to significant carbon emissions, resulting in higher carbon taxes on the final products. Second, the recycling technology for carbon fiber composite materials is still developing, so high-value carbon fibers often end up as waste after one use, leading to unnecessary resource depletion. Thermolysis' unique equipment and technology, we can successfully recycle and reuse carbon fibers. This not only greatly reduces carbon fiber waste but also lowers carbon emissions. Statistics show that producing one ton of new carbon fiber typically results in about 20-40 tons of CO2 emissions. In 2023, Thermolysis had Germany's TÜV Rheinland certify their ISO 14067 carbon footprint standard. The results show that each kilogram of our \"recycled carbon fiber\" only emits 5.047 kilograms of CO2 equivalent. Compared to new materials, Thermolysis' recycled carbon fiber has just one-fifth the carbon emissions. We've also achieved UL 2809 certification for recycled material content verification. The source of recycled carbon fiber materials on the market can be unclear and hard to trace, and inconsistent material quality has made the industry wary of using recycled materials. To earn customer trust, Thermolysis got UL to certify the origin of waste materials. Since 2022, We've secured UL 2809 verification, ensuring full transparency and traceability of material history. This certification proves that Thermolysis processes true recycled materials. Company Profile. Thermolysis, based in Taiwan, specializes in the production of recycled carbon fiber. Founded in 2016, we focus on continuous innovation, especially in developing and integrating high-temperature thermal treatment systems for \"carbon fiber recycling.\" Since 2020, we've been building carbon fiber recycling and regeneration factory lines, engaging in processing and production of recycled carbon fiber. Using recycled carbon fiber as the main raw material, we create a series of intermediate products designed for smooth integration into the industrial chain. Recycled carbon fiber is quite different from virgin fiber in shape, being light and fluffy, with variable lengths and an irregular arrangement, posing challenges for further recycling. To deal with this challenge we committed to developing processed products using recycled carbon fiber, aiming to improve the processability and expand the applications of recycled products. To grow the recycled carbon fiber market, we plan to expand applications to high-value-added products. Besides large-scale recycled carbon fiber production, we meet downstream needs in the carbon fiber industry by designing and manufacturing recycled carbon fiber paper, non-woven materials, and RCF pellets. This ensures a smooth integration of recycled materials into the initial production process. The \"recycled carbon fiber products\" developed by Thermolysis include staple fibers, non-woven fabrics, paper, and plastic pellets. These products can be used in both thermosetting and thermoplastic processes. The thermosetting process uses recycled carbon fiber staple for Bulk Molding Compound (BMC) processing. Alternatively, Resin Transfer Molding (RTM) and Sheet Molding Compound (SMC) methods can impregnate \"recycled carbon fiber non-woven\" and \"recycled carbon fiber paper.\" The \"recycled carbon fiber plastic pellets\" made by Thermolysis using Compounding technology are perfect for the injection process, significantly enhancing the mechanical and electrical properties of the finished products and offers excellent characteristics like plastic formability, suitability for mass production, high reprocess ability, and recyclability. Additionally, \"recycled carbon fiber non-woven\" and \"recycled carbon fiber paper\" can be laminated through hot pressing and thermoplastic film materials. Our product line includes intermediate products like \"recycled carbon fiber prepregs,\" \"recycled carbon fiber thermoplastic laminates,\" and \"recycled carbon fiber pipes.\" TEL：(04)2698-0329 FAX：(04)2698-0330 Email：james.lin@thermolysis-asia.com Company address：No. 68, Wanxing Rd., Dadu Dist., Taichung City 43241, Taiwan (R.O.C.)
