    "text": "From [pv magazine India](https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/07/05/seci-to-launch-second-green-hydrogen-tender/) Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals has begun accepting bids for a green hydrogen production plant to supply 10 ktpa of green hydrogen on a build-own-operate basis. The company will sign a 25-year gas purchase agreement with the successful bidder. The bidder must design, build, finance, test, commission, own, operate, and maintain the unit, supplying green hydrogen continuously during the refinery's on-stream days. The green hydrogen unit's turnaround will align with the refinery's turnaround/shutdown. The plant must use water electrolysis technology and renewable energy for round-the-clock operation. [Solar Energy Corp. of India](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/02/26/seci-unveils-indias-largest-solar-battery-storage-project/) (SECI) plans to issue a second tender to set up 450,000 mtpa of production facilities for green hydrogen and its derivatives in India under the SIGHT Scheme. The tender document will be issued soon. Popular content This content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.
