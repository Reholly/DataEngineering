    "text": "Wildlife officials are on the lookout after an exotic Patagonian mara, a rabbit-like rodent native to South America, was spotted frolicking in the Colorado mountains. A user posted a video of the rare spotting on X, formerly Twitter. The sighting was first reported on Monday, and officials confirmed on Wednesday that the search for the elusive Patagonian mara is still ongoing. The adorable critter, standing two to three feet tall, has been seen by park rangers, hikers, and visitors in Bear Creek Lake Park, located just 15 miles outside of downtown Denver.
