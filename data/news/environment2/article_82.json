    "text": "Where to find some ‘me’ time in LA’s great outdoors Warm weather and clear skies are the perfect excuse to get outside. Los Angeles County’s sprawling landscape can be intimidating to navigate, especially if you're looking for a green space to enjoy. But the L.A. region is home to many nature-filled spots — from the obvious mountains and coastline to pretty parks off busy boulevards. Still, there are so many places to check out we needed some help and asked How To LA listeners and readers for a few of their favorite places. Wow, did they deliver. We’ve compiled a list of their suggestions below, and most are FREE to access. You can also listen to our latest episode to hear directly from a handful of them about what makes their pick special. Greystone Mansion (Beverly Hills) Greystone Mansion is hidden among the residential neighborhoods of Beverly Hills. Once owned by the descendants of L.A.-oil magnate Edward Doheny, the mansion and its grounds have served as a public park since 1971. - Learn which beaches are affected for the holiday - Ethnic studies legislation passes key hurdle - ASL interpretation added to LAUSD meetings For almost a century, the mansion has been a go-to Hollywood backdrop for film and TV backdrop. Its black and white tiled interior can be spotted in Elton John’s “I Want Love” music video featuring Robert Downey Jr. and the 2007 film There Will Be Blood (which is loosely based on the Doheny family). In her iconic music video for “We Belong Together,” Mariah Carey ran down its driveway in a wedding dress. “Greystone Mansion is the epitome of what makes LA special. It has the rich history, a prominent family, the personality, the beauty, the views, and of course the movie industry tied to it.” — L.A. resident Kathy Melamed Address: 905 Loma Vista Dr, Beverly Hills, CA 90210 Hours: 10 a.m. - 6 p.m., 7 days a week Price: Free ($10 per person for a tour) Beverly Gardens Park (Beverly Hills) Beverly Gardens Park is a slice of natural beauty right off Santa Monica Boulevard in Beverly Hills. Its well-known for the Beverly Hills sign, but its 2 miles of forested paths is a favorite of listener Nancy Sherman Kim: \"It offers beautiful rose gardens, a cactus garden, Roman fountains, Grecian sitting area and the friendly familiar faces of your fellow neighbors.” Nancy uses the “fountain-to-fountain” path as a post-work walk spot. But even a casual one-time visit is enough to absorb some of the path’s idyllic features. For fans of contemporary art, the path features a sculpture of psychedelic tulips from famed artist Yayoi Kusama called “Hymn of Life” off Rodeo Drive. Address: Santa Monica Boulevard between Wilshire & Doheny Drive Beverly Hills, CA 90210 Hours: 6 a.m. to 9:30pm, 7 days a week Price: Entry is free. Beverly Hills Public Parking Structures are available across Santa Monica Boulevard for $2 per hour. Sandstone Peak Sandstone Peak is the highest point on the Santa Monica Mountains. The hike is moderately challenging, but the views are well worth it, according to listener Robert Bittner: “The height barrier formed by the Santa Monica Mountains traps coastal clouds and fog. And as the temperatures rise, they sneak their way up into the canyons and over the Bonys. I love the way they climb to meet me, bathing me in their soothing mist as they travel towards Simi Valley and beyond.” There are two adjacent trails to the peak: a 1.5-mile direct path to the summit and Mishe Mokwa Trail, a 6-mile loop. Robert recommends taking the Mishe Mokwa Trail to enjoy ecological wonders of the upper Carlisle Canyon on the path. Note: The 2018 Woolsey Fire destroyed the steps to the summit, so reaching the peak will require some agility. Address: 12896 Yerba Buena Road, Malibu, CA 90265 Hours: Open 24/7. Price: Free Huntington Central Park (Huntington Beach) Huntington Central Park is an expansive green area in Orange County’s Huntington Beach. The park hosts all of the common recreational amenities like sports fields and lakes. However, its Equestrian Center and Urban Forest makes it stand out. Listener Annette Berman used to keep a horse at the center, but now she frequents the park to walk her dog through the Urban Forest and watch other equestrians ride on the paths. The Urban Forest is maintained by the [Huntington Beach Tree Society](https://hbtrees.org/urban-forest-2/) (HB Trees). Their selection of flora is a mix of native Californian shrubbery along Mediterranean and Australian drought-resistant plants. Definitely a spot to see for botanical enthusiasts. Address: 18381 Goldenwest St., Huntington Beach, CA 92648 (Urban Forest: 711 Ellis Ave, Huntington Beach, CA 92648) Hours: 5 a.m. to 10 p.m (Urban Forest: 6 a.m. to 8 p.m.) Price: Free Wattles Garden Park (Hollywood) Situated below Runyon Canyon, Wattles Garden Park is not far from the heart of Hollywood. This property is another mansion turned public park. The Wattles Estate was built in 1907 by Nebraska businessman Gurdon Wattles, and designed by the same architects behind the Beverly Hills Hotel and the Rose Bowl. Listener Andy Keown recommended it as a place of respite from the city: “It has a rolling beautiful green lawn in front of the big house, and people just come and gather and hang out.” There’s a great sprawling view of Hollywood, and the rest of the city, from the lawn’s elevated vantage point. The park’s trails also feature a number of quirky art projects and spiritual shrines to explore. Address: 1850 N Curson Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90046 Hours: 6:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. Price: Free Ascot Hills Park (East LA) Ascot Hills is the spot to catch a sunset. The money shot is of the sun descending next to a picture-perfect silhouette of DTLA’s high rises. For listener María Patiño Gutierrez, this spot stands out for its friendly atmosphere and fresh air. Beyond the views, the park features several beginner-friendly hiking trails on its rolling hills. With so many paths to choose from, it's possible to chart a new course with every visit. Address: 4371 Multnomah St., Los Angeles, CA 90032 Hours: 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Price: Free Baldwin Hills Scenic Overlook (Culver City) The Baldwin Hills Scenic Overlook, also known as the Culver City Steps, is perched at the edge of Culver City. The top of the trail features 360-degree views of L.A. With those views comes a rigorous climb, which makes for a great outdoors workout. Listener Harrison Woliner proposed to his wife at the top of the climb: “One of the beautiful things about this particular park is not only does it have great views of the city, they preserve it pretty well with wild vegetation.” Unlike the rest of the spots on this list, Baldwin Hills does not allow dogs to protect the natural habitat. While Fido will need to stay home, the health of the wild vegetation and animals enhance the outdoorsy feel of the spot. Address: 6300 Hetzler Road, Culver City, CA 90232 Hours: 6 a.m. to 9 p.m., 7 days a week Price: Entry is free. Parking is $2 per hour or $6 per day. Palos Verdes Beach (Rancho Palos Verdes) Palos Verdes Beach is one of the southernmost points of L.A. County. Its Terranea Beach is a secluded spot to lounge and soak in the sun or try out kayaking. The coastline also makes for a scenic walk. While there’s the Terranea Beach Trail to follow, listener Lyn Watanabe has carved out her own route. Parking at Vanderlip Park, she heads west following the coastline on the Beach Trail. Midway into the journey, she recommends stopping at Terranea Resort to enjoy their manicured landscape. Then, as the trail ends, continue through Pelican Cove Park to the Point Vicente Lighthouse. At the lighthouse, there’s a museum on the history of Palos Verdes. It’s also a prime spot for whale watching. Make sure to head down from December to April for the best chance of watching them leap out of the water. Address: 6500 Sea Cove Dr., Rancho Palos Verdes, CA 90275 (Vanderlip Park) Hours: Open 1 hour before sunset to 1 hour after sunset. (Lighthouse is open on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.) Price: Free - The peak of #VanLife may have ended just as COVID restrictions lifted, the movement's had a lasting impact. - It's not just any hedge. It's the one that appeared in the 1978 classic horror film, \"Halloween.\" - For the first time in 17 years, the Dodgers did not win a single postseason game — and fans unleashed the memes. - According to the City of Los Angeles, the car company can break ground on the project. - The victory came courtesy of a Louis Lappe walk-off home run. - A hike can be a beautiful backdrop as you build your connection with someone.",
