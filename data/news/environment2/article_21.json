    "text": "Estimated read time: 1-2 minutes BRAZIL â€” I'm a sucker for unlikely animal friendships. If you have a video of a frog and a leopard frolicking around, I'd love to see it. Same goes for videos of a blue heron and a catfish, an elephant and a meerkat, a rattlesnake and a sloth, an eagle and a lamprey, or a grizzly and a goliath beetle. So when I saw [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHSf4mT7ke8&ab_channel=ViralHog), I had to share. I realize videos are overdone but please indulge me on this one. Just look at the sheep's face when the cat begins to lick it. Pure bliss. And while this might not be the most shocking animal pairing out there, such as an axolotl and an ostrich, it's one that truly works. That sheep really seems to love its cat pal. \"The cat and the sheep are inseparable friends,\" explains the person who posted the footage. \"Every time they meet, he pets her. The sheep lowers her head to his level so he can lick her face and receive lots of love. In the end, he lies down asking for affection too, but the sheep doesn't like it, as only she wants to receive affection from her pet cat.\" Hmmmm. Based on that caption, it actually seems as though this sheep is a bit selfish. If she really wants this relationship to work, she's gonna have to start showing affection to the cat. Otherwise, the cat will eventually make friends with a more gregarious animal, like a moose. Have You Seen This?
