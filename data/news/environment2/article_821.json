    "text": "Former Wisconsin Badgers and current New York Jets running back Braelon Allen is one of ProFootballFocus‚Äô fantasy football sleeper rookie running backs entering the 2024 NFL season.\nAllen was listed along with former Kentucky Wildcats and current Buffalo Bills RB Ray Davis, and former Clemson Tigers and current Philadelphia Eagles RB Will Shipley.\nRelated: Wisconsin and Big Ten bowl projections for 2024 college football season\nAllen projects to be the primary backup to Jets starting running back Breece Hall in 2024. The bruising back should carve out a significant role in short-yardage and goal-line scenarios, especially given the fact that the team selected him in the fourth round of the recent NFL draft.\nPFF notes that Allen is ‚Äòreportedly separating from his subpar in-house competition, flashing even as a pass-catcher.‚Äô It goes on to explain that ‚ÄòAllen has access to a high-volume, dual-threat No. 2 role‚Äô with ‚Äòformer pass-catching specialist Michael Carter now an Arizona Cardinal.‚Äô\nThe three-year starter in Madison enters the professional ranks after 597 carries, 3,494 yards and 35 touchdowns over those three seasons with the Badgers. He also added 49 catches for 275 receiving yards ‚Äî an aspect that he is reportedly working on to carve out a role with the Jets.\nPFF also wrote the following about Allen‚Äôs sleeper status this season:\nNew York No. 1 running back Breece Hall notably worked on the sidelines during organized team activities (OTAs) after experiencing ‚Äú lower-body soreness ‚Äù entering Year 2 post-ACL reconstruction (ACLR) and meniscus trim. Allen would be a high-end must-start, should Hall miss time. Hall‚Äôs 82.5 PFF offense grade ranks sixth among 33 NFL running backs with at least 475 offensive snaps.\nüò¥ Ray Davis, BUF\nüò¥ Braelon Allen, NYJ\nFantasy Football Rookie RB Sleepers for the 2024 Season‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/IkyO0HTisI\n‚Äî PFF College (@PFF_College) July 5, 2024\nAllen will look to capitalize on what appears to be a golden opportunity in year one with the Jets when the season kicks off in early September.\nContact/Follow @TheBadgersWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Wisconsin Badgers news, notes and opinion.",
