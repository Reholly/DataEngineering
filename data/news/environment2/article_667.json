    "text": "Vietnamese students compete at Shell Eco-marathon in Indonesia Friday, 17:25, 05/07/2024 VOV.VN - Vietnamese students representing two teams, HAUI AUTO from Hanoi University of Industry and LH-EV Fuel Cell from Lac Hong University, are competing at the Shell Eco–marathon Asia Pacific and the Middle East 2024 in Indonesia.\nLH-EV Fuel Cell team from Lac Hong University (Photo: xe.baogiaothong.vn) This marks the 13th consecutive time that the countryhas attended the competition.\nThe July 3-6 contest has attracted the participation of 78 student teams from 12 countries in the Asia-Pacific and Middle East regions. They are competing in two categories - “Prototype” and “Urban Concept”. The “Prototype” class focuses on maximum efficiency, while the “Urban Concept” class encourages more practical designs.\nThe HAUI AUTO team from Hanoi University of Industry, who were the competition’s runner-up in 2022 and one of the top 5 winners in 2023, have chosen to compete in the Prototype-Internal Combustion Engine segment. Elsewhere, LH-EV Fuel Cell from Lac Hong University are determined to continue their impressive series of achievements in the Urban Concept category - Hydrogen Fuel Cell this year, as the team bagged the championship in this category for five consecutive years between 2015 and 2019.\nThe team from Lac Hong University were also the only local representative to make it to the final round of the Shell Eco-marathon held in London in 2019.\nThe competition aims to encourage students to be creative and apply advanced technology in order toefficiently use power. It also challenges students’ innovativeness and creativeness requiring them to design and construct the most energy efficient vehicle. It therefore seeks to inspire young engineers from around the region to develop new approaches aimed atfueling efficiency.\nVOV",
