    "text": "Norwegian Maritime CleanTech has launched a new initiative to support the green transition in the maritime sector.\nThe project, “Energy Hub for Ships,” aims to establish essential infrastructure for low-emission shipping.\nIt is funded by a grant from Bergen Municipality, and according to Maritime CleanTech, aligns with Bergen’s ambitions to enhance charging infrastructure for various transport sectors.\nTo ensure a comprehensive approach, Maritime CleanTech said the company will engage its network of partners in the maritime sector, including shipowners, energy companies and technology developers, for the project.\nTwo workshops will be organized during the second half of 2024 to gather expert opinions and facilitate stakeholder discussions, Maritime CleanTech added.\nThe first workshop will be held in September and focus on potential charging hub locations and power availability in the short and long term, while the second workshop is expected in November and will focus on vessel segments, technologies and future development needs.\nBased on input from these discussions, a final report with recommendations will be prepared and presented at One Ocean Week in April 2025, Maritime CleanTech noted.\nSilje Sivertsen, Project Developer at Maritime CleanTech, commented: “This project is crucial for achieving Bergen’s low-emission goals by 2030… The Energy Hub for Ships project represents a significant step towards a greener maritime industry, showcasing Bergen’s commitment to sustainability and innovation.”\nTo remind, in June 2024, Maritime CleanTech and Ocean Hyway Cluster partnered with Innovation Norway to enhance green maritime collaboration between Norway and Singapore. The aim is to position Norwegian suppliers at the forefront of the Southeast Asian maritime market.\nRelated Article Posted: 16 days ago Norway and Singapore solidify green maritime collaboration Categories: Collaboration Posted: 16 days ago",
