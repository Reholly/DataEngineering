He further said that they have identified degraded land where more trees can be planted. \"All the problems related to global warming, and heatwaves can be countered by planting trees. I had a meeting with the officer of the forest department, and wherever there is degraded land due to work on the national highway, we will plant trees there,\" Debbarma said. He also stated that the forest department has a target to plant an additional 40 to 45 lakh trees by the end of this year. \"At the end of the year, we have a target to plant an additional 40-45 lakh trees.
