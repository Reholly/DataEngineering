    "text": "UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — For Katie Stanley, joining the Penn State Extension Master Watershed Steward volunteer program in 2019 was a perfect complement to her day job as an interpretative naturalist for Allegheny County Parks. “Many of the things I’ve learned as a Master Watershed Steward I’ve been able to implement into my professional development at the Latodami Nature Center,” Stanley said. “Too many people don’t know what a watershed is, but once you learn about their function, it helps pieces of the environmental puzzle fall into place.” Located in Wexford, Latodami Nature Center covers approximately 250 acres of woodlands, meadows and wetlands. The center hosts guided programs for all age groups throughout the year and has miles of nature trails. The 1914 dairy barn on-site holds an open-air auditorium for large group events. “When you understand watersheds, you also get an understanding of how your actions may impact an entire system,” Stanley said. “That’s my favorite part, but also the most challenging — when you see how much impact you can have as a single person, you have to decide to use that knowledge to benefit our planet.” In addition to utilizing information from the Master Watershed Steward program in her day job, Stanley was inspired to look for more ways she could put what she was learning into practical use. “As I went through the program and became equipped with all of this knowledge, I felt like there was more I could do to use what I learned to its full potential,” she said. “Completing my certification came at the perfect time and allowed me to be involved in the creation of the Big Sewickley Creek Watershed Association.” The Big Sewickley Creek watershed is a 30-square-mile area of land that incorporates 12 municipalities and three counties. The watershed is home to unique and important features and is used in a variety of ways by local residents and businesses. The association’s mission is “to educate and inspire members of the Big Sewickley Creek watershed on the importance and individuality of their watershed and the threats to water quality and property due to flooding.” The association also focuses on the conservation of “water and the surrounding landscape for the enjoyment of current and future generations.” Stanley currently serves as the association’s president. “This has taught me so much about giving back to my local community and local ecosystems,” Stanley added. “I’m forever grateful to the Master Watershed Steward program for putting this possibility on my radar.” Stanley noted that the Big Sewickley Creek Watershed Association recently received a grant from Berkshire Hathaway Energy (BHE GT&S) and the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy. This helped the association acquire a turbidity meter and conduct ongoing testing on water quality, which is important as increased development in the region is leading to more dirt in waterways. The equipment will enable the association to establish baseline data to reference in the future. The Big Sewickley Creek Watershed Association is gearing up for its second annual Rights of Nature Festival on Oct. 26. During this event, the public is invited to learn about the diversity of life that exists within the watershed and what they can do to help preserve it. More information about the event is available on the association’s Facebook page. “If you care about the natural world around you, being a Master Watershed Steward will be so fulfilling,” Stanley said. “This experience has not only supplied me with valuable knowledge but has also provided me insight into the incredible network of environmental professionals and enthusiasts, all of whom share the common goal of bettering the planet for all living things.” Laurie Maglietta, Master Watershed Steward coordinator for Penn State Extension in Allegheny County, was a volunteer herself before stepping into the coordinator role. She highlighted Stanley’s impressive 400-plus hours of logged volunteer time and added that all the Master Watershed Stewards bring energy and passion to their work. “In today’s world, it can be so easy to get sucked into a doom-and-gloom mentality over the future of the environment,” Maglietta said. “The Master Watershed Steward program gives people the skills and knowledge to make a change. It provides a vehicle for hope and makes us feel like we’re part of making things better.” The Penn State Master Watershed Steward program provides extensive training in watershed management to volunteers who, in return, educate the community about watershed stewardship based on university research and recommendations. The program was established to strengthen local capacity for management and protection of watersheds, streams and rivers by educating and empowering volunteers across the commonwealth.
