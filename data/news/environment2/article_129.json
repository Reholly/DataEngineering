    "text": "The Blue Mountains Animal Care Centre (BMACC) is open, with Council taking over the former RSPCA Mort Street shelter on Friday, 5 July. Services are being rolled out in stages. Council's initial focus is on getting the new centre up and running, while continuing to provide a best practice impounding function for stray animals as required by the NSW Companions Animal Act and the NSW Protection of Cruelty to Animals Act. BMACC is expected to officially open in August. When fully operational, it will provide the community with a facility for the rehoming of cats and dogs. RSPCA NSW transferred ownership of the Mort Street Animal Care Facility and land to Council after reaching an agreement that includes a 20-year covenant to protect the site's ongoing use as a local animal care and rehoming shelter. Blue Mountains Mayor, Mark Greenhill said: \"This is a significant commitment by Council to animal welfare, given the facility will cost around $350,000 to set-up. There will also be about $580,000 in recurring annual costs, including employment and operating costs. \"We are delighted that negotiations with RSPCA NSW resulted in a solution that means best practice animal welfare services can continue across the City, after four successful decades.\" Council has appointed an Animal Facilities Coordinator to help manage the centre. Emma Rawling brings three decades of care to BMACC, including previous experience as a vet nurse, animal welfare inspector, and shelter worker. \"My vision for the new BMACC is simple: to do the very best we can for animals and the community,\" Emma said. \"I'm keen that we provide the very highest welfare standards at the pound and use a modern wholistic approach. \"To start with, there will be a small team of six staff providing a seven-day-a-week care to stray and impounded animals, mostly dogs and cats. \"In the longer term, I hope we can help minimise stray and unwanted animals in the Blue Mountains using preventative education and community outreach.\" Council has been meeting with a reference group of volunteers about the newly formed centre. There is a strong history of volunteering at the shelter and Council welcomes the continued involvement of volunteers, to help ensure the successful operation of the facility into the future. Operating at the former RSPCA site at 121-125 Mort Street, Katoomba, BMACC is currently open by appointment only.
