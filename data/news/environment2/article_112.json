    "text": "Volunteers plant marsh grass at Fort Macon State Park to help coastline BEAUFORT, N.C. (WITN) — Volunteers are planting thousands of tiny marsh grass plants to help with restoration efforts at Fort Macon State Park. The plants, called Spartina Alterniflora, help filter pollutants out of the water, according to Coastal Resiliency Manager Sarah Bodin. This is part of the North Carolina Coastal Federation’s mission to bolster the park’s natural defenses against environmental stressors. “This restoration project is fundamental to preserving the health of our coastal ecosystems, which serve as vital habitats and natural filters,” said Bodin. Meanwhile, researchers from NC State University and Duke University are studying ways to refine marsh restoration techniques. “Our research aims to evaluate the ecological impact of various planting strategies on habitat restoration and biodiversity enhancement,” NC State Post-Doctoral Researcher Trevyn Toone explained. Nearly 4,000 plants were put into the ground through this event. Copyright 2024 WITN. All rights reserved.",
