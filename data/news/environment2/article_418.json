    "text": "Servotech Power Systems share price will remain in focus as the leading manufacturer of EV chargers and solar solutions inaugurated Delhiâ€™s first grid-connected Solar-Powered EV Charging Carport in collaboration with India's apex solar organization, the National Solar Energy Federation of India (NSEFI). The solar-powered EV charging carport has been established as a pilot project at the Hauz Khas Village parking station. India is implementing the world's largest Renewable Energy (RE) expansion program, envisaging a 5-fold increase in the overall RE production capacity. Energy independence is economically advantageous. A shift to electric transportation will create $ 2.5 trillion in net consumer savings by 2047.The company in a statement said, \\\"Servotech has manufactured, designed, and commissioned the solar panels and EV chargers used to establish the carport. Additionally, Servotech has been responsible for designing and implementing the overall infrastructure for the carport.\\\"On this occasion, Raman Bhatia, Founder and Managing director, Servotech Power Systems Ltd. said \\\"This initiative will prove to be beneficial in decarbonizing mobility and electricity through solar energy. The growth of India's solar and energy storage sectors across various fronts is dynamic, and by integrating renewable energy solutions into our infrastructure, we not only address current environmental challenges but also pave the way for a cleaner, more sustainable future for all.\\\"The world's fifth-largest economy, India can achieve energy independence through clean technology by 2047. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Atmanirbhar Bharat push spans from a massive renewable capacity addition to the electric mobility, saving billions of dollars in imports.",
