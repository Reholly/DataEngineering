    "text": "NHRA drag racing legend John Force suffered a serious head injury during a fiery crash at over 300 mph last week but is showing daily signs of improvement according to his team.\nFrom initial setbacks to positive signs After the catastrophic crash at Virginia Motorsports Park, Force struggled initially, unable to follow simple commands like opening his eyes or moving his extremities. Five days later, he began to show signs of momentum, responding to commands with a thumbs-up and recognizing family members by name.\nThe Force family is right by his side through it all. His daughter Brittany Force , herself a champion racer, shared her determination to stay: My dad’s going to be all right – I was in the ambulance with him, holding his hand. He’s one of the toughest people I know, so he’ll bounce back like he always does.\nA long journey ahead Force has been transferred from the trauma ICU to the neurological ICU for more focused care on his head injury. The road ahead is difficult, with challenges including managing his extreme agitation and confusion.\nThe move was a welcome positive for his family members, who have maintained a daily presence at the hospital all week, said a statement from the Force team. The NHRA community has also rallied around the racing icon, providing significant support during this challenging time.\nCourage under fire – Past and present This isn’t the first time John Force has shown resilience. In 2007 he sustained severe injuries during a crash in Ennis, Texas. He continued to race at an elite level and four weeks ago won his record 157th NHRA victory in New Hampshire.\nHis journey has been one of unyielding persistence and great success despite numerous setbacks. As he recovers from the most recent incident, Force’s willpower and family’s support remain key elements in his ongoing recovery journey.",
