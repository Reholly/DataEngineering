    "text": "Calling all local farmers! Tweed Shire Council is kicking off another round of the Sustainable Agriculture Small Grants Program, designed to encourage best practice and inspire environmental creativity in agricultural activities across our community. Applications are now open from 1 July to 30 August for grants up to $4,000. Eligible activities include trials and adoptions of improved farming practices. Council's Program Leader â€“ Sustainable Agriculture Eli Szandala, said these grants are just one way Council is able to support farmers in their efforts to improve soil, waterway and natural area management. \"Given agriculture's significant role in land use and its pivotal contribution to the region's economy, offering technical and financial support to farmers for projects focusing on sustainable agricultural practices is crucial,\" Mr Szandala said. \"These practices are critical as we all strive to conserve our unique environment, respond to climate change and enhance the natural resources on farms which are essential for their long-term viability. \"Last year we were pleasantly surprised by the number of innovative projects put forward by our farming community, and we hope to see farmers who want to be more sustainable but might need some support, to apply this year.\" Grants will be awarded to projects that showcase innovation, efficiency and environmental responsibility in agricultural production. These projects may include enhancements in soil health, water conservation and management and biodiversity conservation. The grant program has been running since 2018 providing farmers with financial and technical support to initiate projects that improve the health of soils, waterways and biodiversity on local farms. The program complements other incentives including the River Health and Biodiversity Grant Programs also offered by Council. Back Creek grazier Sherelle French utilised program funding to extend fencing around crucial environmental assets on her farm. Initially focusing on cattle fences around dams, which significantly enhanced water quality and dam conditions, Ms French expanded her efforts to protect other vulnerable areas from livestock impacts. \"We were able to fence our cattle out of some of the very last rainforest left in the area along the creek,\" Ms French said. \"We couldn't possibly have afforded this without the grant from Council's Sustainable Agriculture Small Grant Program. Now this precious piece of riparian rainforest is free to grow, via natural regeneration and a little help from me.\" The Sustainable Agriculture Small Grants Program highlights Council's commitment to working with the community to reduce our impact on the natural environment and adapt to climate change for a sustainable future.
