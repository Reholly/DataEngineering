    "text": "TULSA, Okla. â€” The Tulsa Area Chapters of the Sons and Daughters of the American Revolution held a ceremony to celebrate the 248th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. The ceremony started with a presentation of the American flag and the Pledge of Allegiance. Ron Painter is the honorary State President of the Oklahoma Sons of the American revolution. He led the ceremony and reminded the crowd of the true meaning of Independence Day. \"We all enjoy going to the lake and having cookouts and doing fireworks, but we should all remember the importance of the day from the historical standpoint and what our ancestors did to secure our freedom,\" Painter said. Painter didn't allow heat to delay the event. \"It's difficult for me to complain about the heat when I'm going to get in my air-conditioned car and go home, so we think about the sacrifice of our ancestors, and it helps us end this 30 minute program,\" Painter said. He said the goal is to educate, commemorate and show gratitude. The bell was rung once for each of the 13 original colonies. Painter hopes this event inspires people to learn more about American history. \"Hopefully, they'll go home and tell their children about it and maybe encourage some thirst for education of historical events in American history, like the formation of our government, to become inquisitive about how that works,\" Painter added. If you missed the event, Painter said they plan to host this same event next year.",
