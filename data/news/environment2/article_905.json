    "text": "Summary\n- Some of the best hiking trails in Washington require permits.\n- The Snow Lake Trail is a stunning permit hike, but it's challenging with steep switchbacks, offering breathtaking views of Snow Lake nestled in a dramatic cirque as a reward.\n- The Skyline Loop trail is a popular Washington permit hike, providing stunning views of Mount Rainier and Emmons Glacier.\nWashington State seems to be overflowing with hidden lakes, jaw-dropping waterfalls, towering mountains, emerald forests, and wildflower meadows that look straight out of a dream. But here's the thing: some of these dreamy spots are like the VIP sections of Washington's hiking trails, and you have to obtain permits to get in. Still, that just makes the reward even sweeter.\nIn this list, you'll discover some of the\nbest hikes in Washington that require permits. Make sure to apply for each hike's respective permit in advance to avoid disappointment! [Related ](/waterfall-hikes-in-washington-to-take-in-summer/) [ 8 Waterfall Hikes To Take This Summer In Washington ](/waterfall-hikes-in-washington-to-take-in-summer/)\nCombining beauty and geological significance, these magnificent waterfalls in Washington, reached via scenic hikes, are worth the chase this summer.\n7 Skyline Loop Trail\nBreathtaking panoramic views of the Cascade Mountains and great for wildflower spotting in late spring/summer\nWithout a doubt, the\nSkyline Loop Trail is one of Washington State's best hiking trails, and for all the right reasons. The trailhead is located at Paradise, near the Henry M. Jackson Visitor Center and Paradise Inn. From either park entrance (Nisqually or Stevens Canyon), it's about a 40-minute drive to Paradise.\nThe first leg of the trail is a steady climb through subalpine meadows. At 1.7 miles, 2.7 kilometers into the hike, you’ll get to Panorama Point. This is a popular spot to take a break and enjoy stunning views of Mount Rainier, Emmons Glacier (the largest glacier in the continental US by volume), and the surrounding valleys. You'll also find interpretive signs here explaining the glacial features.\nAfter Panorama Point, the trail climbs more steeply through meadows and rockfall areas into the Wilcox basin. You might spot some marmots and pikas sunning themselves on the rocks here.\nThe final stretch brings you back to the Paradise area, where you can relax and relish your accomplishment. Treat yourself to a well-deserved meal or snack at Paradise Inn, or explore the visitor center for further insights into Mount Rainier's wonders.\nPermit Required\nDifficulty from Alltrails\n| |\n4.8 (Hard)\n6 Snow Lake Trail\nA scenic hike with a beautiful alpine lake as the reward; plus, a chance to see mountain goats\nThe\nSnow Lake Trail is 6.7 miles (10.8 kilometers) out and back. Prepare for a significant climb of approximately 3,400 feet (1,036 meters). Budget an average of 3–4 hours for the round trip, but adjust based on your hiking pace and breaks.\nOne of the most\nscenic Washington hiking routes, the starting point of this trail is located at the north end of the main parking lot at Alpental Ski Area. The trail begins with a gradual climb through a scenic forest. You'll cross over a cascading waterfall, which is a refreshing sight and sound on a warm day.\nAt this point, you'll encounter a junction with the Source Lake Overlook Trail. If you're up for some additional mileage and stunning views of Snow Lake from a different perspective, this detour adds about a mile (1.6 kilometers) to your hike.\nAfter the junction, the trail kicks into high gear with a series of steep switchbacks. This is the most challenging part of the hike, so take your time and pace yourself. As you emerge from the trees, you'll be rewarded with your first breathtaking view of Snow Lake nestled amid a dramatic cirque. Take a moment to soak in the scenery and capture some photos.\nBe prepared for sudden weather changes, especially near the lake. Pack layers and rain gear. The trail can be crowded, especially on weekends. Consider going early or on weekdays for a quieter experience.\nPermit Required\n| |\nDifficulty from Alltrails\n| |\n4.7 (Hard)\nLocation\n[Related ](/most-hike-friendly-towns-in-washington/) [ 8 Most Hike-Friendly Towns In Washington ](/most-hike-friendly-towns-in-washington/)\nThese are some of the best hiking towns in Washington, each providing easy access to some of the state's most scenic and diverse trails!\n5 Wallace Falls Via Woody Trail\nEasy access, perfect for families with children, and a stunning waterfall as the highlight\nThe\nWallace Falls Via Woody Trail in Washington is a fantastic hike for families and adventurers alike. The trail gains about 1,300 feet (396 meters) in elevation. Most of the climbing is concentrated at the middle and upper falls.\nThe trailhead is conveniently located near the parking lot at Wallace Falls State Park. There are restrooms and an information kiosk available here. The initial part of the Woody Trail is a pleasant walk through a second-growth forest alongside the Wallace River. Thereafter, you'll come across a bridge crossing the Wallace River. This marks the spot where the relatively flat Railroad Grade Trail branches off.\nThe first cascade you'll encounter is the Lower Wallace Falls. This 20-foot waterfall tumbles over moss-covered rocks into a clear pool. It's a great spot to take a break and enjoy the cool spray.\nThe trail continues along the river, with a more noticeable incline as you gain elevation. The path is well-maintained with switchbacks, making the climb manageable.\nAt about 2.3 miles or 3.7 kilometers into the trip, you'll bump into the magnificent 60-foot Middle Wallace Falls. This is the tallest and most powerful of the three (but it is not as tall as the other\nincredible high-elevation peaks that you can hike in Washington!).\nThere's a viewing platform where you can marvel at the power and beauty of the cascading water. Many hikers choose to turn around here and enjoy the view before heading back. If you're up for the challenge, the trail continues towards Upper Wallace Falls. This section is the steepest part of the hike with switchbacks through a denser forest. Take your time and enjoy the fresh mountain air before heading back along the same path downhill.\nPermit Required\nDifficulty from Alltrails\n| |\n4.7 (Moderate)\nLocation\n4 Lake 22 Trail\nHike to a tranquil and secluded alpine lake surrounded by towering evergreens\nThe\nLake 22 Trail in Washington is a popular route for hikers seeking a beautiful alpine lake surrounded by old-growth forests. The trailhead is situated on the Mountain Loop Highway, east of Granite Falls. Look for the well-marked sign for the Lake Twenty-Two Trail (#702). There's a parking lot nearby, but it can fill up on weekends, so arrive early.\nThe initial part of the trail winds through a lush rainforest with towering old-growth trees. Listen for the sounds of Twenty-Two Creek flowing alongside the path. You'll encounter a bridge crossing over Twenty-Two Creek. Here, you can take a moment to admire the waterfalls before moving along.\nThe trail continues its upward journey, with switchbacks helping manage the incline. Be prepared for some sections with loose rock or roots, so watch your footing. After a series of switchbacks, you'll be rewarded with your first glimpse of the beautiful Lake 22 nestled in a cirque.\nThe vibrant turquoise water surrounded by lush forest creates a breathtaking vista that makes up for all the loose rocks that may have hit your leg on your way up. You can relax on the shore of the lake, take in the stunning scenery, and enjoy a well-deserved lunch break. There's a one-mile loop trail around the lake if you want to explore further.\nThis is a challenging hike with a steep ascent. Be sure to be in good physical condition before attempting it. Bring plenty of water and snacks, as there are no services on the trail.\nPermit Required\nDifficulty from Alltrails\n| |\n4.7 (Hard)\nLocation\n3 Mount Si Trail\nA challenging hike with rewarding summit views, great for experienced hikers seeking a workout\nThe Mount Si Trail is generally considered one of Washington’s hardest hikes, so it is not exactly ideal for young children. The consistent incline, switchbacks, and final scramble make this a challenging hike for experienced hikers.\nThe trail begins with a moderate climb through a lush evergreen forest. Things begin to change at about 1.5-4 miles, 2.4-6.4 kilometers into the hike. The trail picks up the pace here with a series of switchbacks that steadily climb the mountainside. This section can be tiring, so take your time and enjoy the fresh mountain air. As you gain elevation, the forest thins, revealing glimpses of the valley below.\nAt 4 miles, you'll get to the Old Trail Junction. This steeper and shorter trail leads to the summit, but it's not recommended for everyone due to its loose terrain. The main trail continues to the right. If you continue on the right path for about half a mile, you'll be rewarded with breathtaking panoramic views of the surrounding peaks, including Mount Rainier on a clear day.\nThe final push to the summit involves navigating granite slabs and a short scramble. This section requires good balance and sturdy footwear. If you're not comfortable scrambling, it's best to turn around here and enjoy the views from the top of the main trail.\nPermit Required\nDifficulty from Alltrails\n| |\n4.7 (Hard)\nLocation\n2 Bridal Veil Falls Trail\nHike to one of the tallest waterfalls in Washington, easily accessible with a moderate hike\nThe Bridal Veil’s Falls trail begins by following an old road bed through a beautiful forest of towering Douglas firs, maples, and moss-covered trees. The trail continues along the old road bed, but you'll encounter a few streams that you'll need to cross using provided rocks or small bridges.\nThe incline starts to pick up a bit here, but it's still manageable. At the 2-mile mark, you'll reach a junction with a short side trail leading to Lake Serene. This pretty alpine lake adds about 0.25 miles (0.4 kilometers) to your hike if you choose to go there and back.\nContinuing on the main trail towards Bridal Veil Falls, you'll start encountering steeper sections with switchbacks and stairs. The last stretch of the trail is the steepest. Take your time and use the provided handrails and stairs for balance.\nAs you near the top, you'll start hearing the roar of the falls and might even catch glimpses of the cascading water through the trees. Congratulations! You've reached the base of the magnificent 1328-foot (405-meter) tall Bridal Veil Falls.\nPermit Required\nDifficulty from Alltrails\n| |\n4.7 (Moderate)\nLocation\n| |[Related ](/scenic-washington-hikes-less-than-five-miles/) [ 7 Scenic Washington Hikes Less Than Five Miles ](/scenic-washington-hikes-less-than-five-miles/)\nThese Washington hikes 5 miles or less may be short but offer a lot; scenic meadows, forests, wildflowers, waterfalls, and stunning viewpoints await!\n1 Colchuck Lake Trail\nA challenging adventure for experienced backpackers with a stunning turquoise lake nestled in a cirque\nStarting a hike on the\nColchuck Lake Trail is easy. The initial section begins with a pleasant walk through a cool, evergreen forest alongside Mountaineer Creek. After this initial section, the trail gets steeper as you switch your way back up the hillside. There's a bridge crossing over Mountaineer Creek, offering a nice spot to take a break and enjoy the sound of rushing water.\nThe trail enters a section with more open terrain and loose rocks. Watch your footing carefully, especially in this area. At around 4 miles, you'll reach a junction with a side trail leading to Aasgard Pass, which is a popular route for backpackers venturing deeper into the Enchantments wilderness.\nAs you climb higher, the trees become more sparse, revealing breathtaking panoramic views of the surrounding mountains. In late summer, this section is often bursting with colorful wildflowers. The same thing happens on other\nbeautiful Washington hidden gem summer trails. If you’re lucky, you might see some marmots or mountain goats here.\nYour final destination is only a few meters from this section. The crystal-clear water reflects the surrounding peaks, creating a picture-perfect scene. Enjoy a well-deserved rest on the shore, have a picnic lunch, and take in the beauty of this alpine paradise. There are campsites around the lake, but overnight stays require a permit during peak season (May 15–October 31).\nGoing back downhill can be tough on the knees, so take it slow and use hiking poles for extra support if you have them.\nPermit Required\n| |\nDifficulty from Alltrails\n| |\n4.7 (Hard)\nLocation",
