    "text": "Four Seasons Resorts Lanai Recognized for Environmental Efforts\nWEBWIRE– Friday, July 5, 2024 Four Seasons Resort Lanai recently has been recognized for its responsible business practices. The first certification is by the Hawai‘i Tourism Authority (HTA), which just announced Qurator, its official mark of excellence for Hawai‘i-based and operating businesses. The broadest visitor industry certification of its kind, Qurator serves to guide visitors to Hawai‘i products and experiences that incorporate responsible tourism practices, while adding value and recognizing those businesses for their positive contributions to the environment, community and economy. To achieve Qurator certification, businesses are evaluated based on the program’s six categories of criteria: Environment, Cultural Support, Equity, Safety, Community, and Guest Experience.\nBoth Four Seasons Resort Lanai and\nSensei Lanai, A Four Seasons Resort have received Hawaii Green Business Awards. The Hawai‘i Green Business Program (HGBP) is a free state program that assists and recognizes businesses that strive to operate in an environmentally and socially responsible manner. The group’s mission is to help businesses go beyond compliance, particularly in the areas of energy and water conservation, waste reduction, prevention of pollution, natural resource preservation, community involvement and cultural presentation. HGBP is a partnership between the Hawaii State Energy Office, the State’s Department of Health, and the Board of Water Supply; this program highlights businesses that are dedicated to creating a sustainable Hawai‘i.\n“We are committed to building upon Four Seasons strong history of supporting our communities and the environment, leaving a positive, long-lasting impact on the storied places where we operate and live,” says\nAvi Phookan, General Manager, Four Seasons Resort Lanai. “Our entire team is involved in our efforts, from executing water-efficient golf course management, reducing food waste and sourcing sustainable partners to island clean-ups and conservation projects. Recently, in honour of World Ocean Month, colleagues and community members joined our partner Project Reef in a wonderful day preserving and caring for Kaiolohia Beach, also known as Shipwreck Beach.”\nThe Resort provides complimentary mineral-safe Project Reef sunscreen to guests\non the pool grounds and at the beach kiosk, complementing its reef friendly organic landscaping, for which Maui Nui Marine Resource Council awarded Gold Certification.\nFour Seasons Resorts Lanai is committed to caring for the land and understanding, preserving, and sharing the island’s culture, traditions and history throughout its operations. Conserving energy and precious natural resources, developing strategic partnerships, implementing sustainable practices and engaging colleagues in education and stewardship allow the Resorts to respect and care for its island home. Through Love Lanai, guests can experience the island’s unique living environment and cultural-historical legacy that spans nearly 1,000 years of Hawaiian residency and a diverse cultural heritage though a variety of tours, demonstrations, and cultural experiences through unique, authentic and respectful programming.\nLearn more about sustainability at\nhttps://www.fourseasons.com/lanai/services-and-amenities/sustainability/ and Sensei Lanai, A Four Seasons Resort Lanai.\n( Press Release Image:\nhttps://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/7/324020/324020-1.jpg )\nWebWireID324020\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.
