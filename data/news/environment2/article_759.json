    "text": "In the Southeast, particularly Georgia, peach growers faced a daunting challenge as they encountered one of the most severe spring freezes in recent history last year, decimating the majority of their crop. This year, however, they are witnessing a substantial recovery, with expectations to ship approximately 3 million boxes, equating to 75 million pounds of peaches, marking a 25% increase over a typical year's production.\nThe drastic drop in 2023 saw the state's peach yield plummet to less than 5% of its usual volume, attributed to unusually low temperatures in March that damaged the blossoms. This event marked Georgia's most significant crop loss since 1955. The adverse conditions necessitated the early departure of H-2A workers, impacting both the workforce and local economies. Nonetheless, the current season shows promise, with a robust comeback in both tree vitality and workforce engagement, as all H-2A workers have returned. Early varieties began harvesting in May, aligning with the standard timeline, and growers are now focused on rekindling sales relationships in anticipation of the peak demand period in June and July. This recovery narrative is not isolated to Georgia; in South Carolina, Titan Farms also faced one of its lowest yields in 2023 but has since adjusted its strategy to concentrate on its top 10 retailers. These experiences underscore the resilience and adaptive strategies of peach growers in the region.\nSource:\ngoodfruit.com",
