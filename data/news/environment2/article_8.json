    "text": "In celebration of World Environment Day, Bank of Ceylon partnered with the Department of Wildlife Conservation and the Divisional Secretariat Colombo to launch a significant environmental initiative.\nThe event featured an awareness programme focusing on environmental conservation and the critical importance of preserving our natural resources for a better future.\nFollowing the awareness session, participants engaged in a hands-on beach clean-up at the Galle Face Turtle Beach conservation area. This initiative aimed to highlight the importance of protecting marine life and maintaining clean and healthy coastal ecosystems.\nThe event garnered support from multiple governmental and non-governmental organisations, which play a pivotal role in preserving the environment. Their participation and contributions helped reinforce the collective commitment to a sustainable future.\n“We are pleased to have partnered with key stakeholders for this significant initiative,” said the Assistant General Manager, Sustainable Banking, of Bank of Ceylon. “Our aim is to raise awareness and take actionable steps towards environmental conservation, ensuring a healthier planet for future generations.”\nBank of Ceylon remains dedicated to fostering sustainable practices and promoting environmental consciousness through its various programs and initiatives. This event supports the bank’s ongoing efforts to make a positive impact on the environment and the community.",
