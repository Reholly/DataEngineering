    "text": "Murrindindi Shire Council's first electric vehicle (EV) is on the road, consistent with our commitment to reducing emissions and helping the transition towards a sustainable future. Replacing an old petrol fleet car, this new vehicle will be available for Council staff to use for work purposes and for travelling to meetings around the Shire. Residents will have no trouble recognising the vehicle, with bright graphics proudly promoting its use of clean energy. The vehicle is charged at a Council-owned station in Alexandra, with renewable energy as Council purchases 100% renewable energy through the Victorian Energy Collaboration. Council will continue to expand its EV fleet over time and advocate for more public and private EV charging infrastructure across the Shire. Public chargers are available in Alexandra and Kinglake, and there are Tesla charging stations located in Yea. Additional EV charging infrastructure will not only help locals, but it will also attract more visitors to the region. [here](/councils-first-electric-vehicle-joins-fleet-1270080/).",
