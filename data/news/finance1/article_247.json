    "text": "Apple, in its effort to advance its success in the industry, is preparing to implement various changes. The company, which claims to make devices ‘smarter’, aims to use more powerful hardware and strengthen the interaction between humans and technology. Here are the details: Apple products will now be smarter! The rapidly advancing technology has pushed the entire tech world, including major corporations, to take innovative steps. Known for its innovative approach, Apple plans to further its position in the sector by developing smarter and more successful products. The company is taking serious steps based on more advanced artificial intelligence models and superior performance hardware. In today’s technology, our smart devices can take voice commands from us and respond to them, monitor our heart rate and blood oxygen levels in real-time, translate all world languages into each other, and allow us to video chat with our loved ones. These functions have become quite standard. However, artificial intelligence technology, which is just starting to be integrated into our lives, has not yet reached this level of ordinariness. Apple, wanting to redefine the norms at this point, plans to spend more time on artificial intelligence technology in the coming period to introduce state-of-the-art products to the user experience. With this leap, the tech giant aims to surpass the current limitations of artificial intelligence technology and is trying to bring a new perspective to the AI models used in its devices. Apple’s research team has tackled the issue of ‘memory’, one of the biggest factors limiting artificial intelligence. Thanks to a new method discovered during the research process, artificial intelligence models can operate at a capacity equivalent to twice the DRAM size of the device while significantly speeding up CPU and GPU operations. The steps taken by the company within this mindset seem to set the stage for the beginning of a new era in the technology world. We expect the company, which will be discussed in the future with much more successful results, is allocating a significant budget for these steps. What do you think about this topic?
