    "text": "Inc describes how brands will usher in a new era in influencer marketing in 2024 with user-generated content and engaging real customers. The article highlights how brands in 2024 are increasingly leveraging everyday people instead of professional content creators. This tactic, which includes giving away products and affiliate revenue, aims to strengthen relationships with customers and involve brand superfans more closely in product development.\nExperts in the influencer marketing industry were the first to notice this trend. Chris Jacks from the agency HireInfluence emphasizes that user generated content (UGC) is particularly suitable for companies with limited marketing budgets. Changing algorithms and social platforms, as well as consumers’ preference for less polished and produced content, have contributed to this change.\nBrands like Perelel and Beauty Stat work with existing customers to generate UGC by offering free products. This strategy not only leads to conversion but also long-term visibility. Additionally, brands emphasize the importance of building lasting relationships through rewards such as invitations to brand events or being featured on the website or social media.\nGifting strategies are also an important part of this approach, with brands able to offer incentives such as affiliate commissions on TikTok or advertising discounts for creating UGC. It’s also important to strategically decide who to send products to, with a focus on micro-influencers in relevant niches.\nWhile traditional influencer marketing still has its place, the article emphasizes that diversity in marketing strategy, including incorporating UGC, is beneficial for brands. Especially for brands with limited budgets or those looking to diversify their influencer marketing campaigns, this approach offers a solid option.\n2023-12-28 20:06:37\n#Revolution #Influencer #Marketing #Power #Superfans",
