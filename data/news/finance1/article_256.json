    "text": "The Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of the Anambra State ICT Agency, Mr. Chukwuemeka Fred Agbata , has attributed his success story in the management and advancement of technological initiatives and innovations in Anambra to journalists. Agbata in a press statement personally signed by him, noted that his partnership and collaborations with journalists in the state made it possible for him to succeed as well as excel greatly in his assignment as the MD/CEO of the state ICT agency. He said that the role of journalists as moral compass of the society can not be overemphasized, hence the society relies heavily on their functions as agenda setters to inform and enlighten the people on public policy, which he said, was where the ICT agency leveraged on to showcase her activities to Ndi-Anambra. While expressing profound gratitude and deep appreciation to journalists for the robust synergy and coverage of his programmes and activities from inception as the MD/CEO of the Anambra State ICT Agency, Agbata equally thanked Governor Charles Chukwuma Soludo, who provided the enabling environment for him to prove his mettle as a tech expert. His press statement reads, ” I am writing to express my deepest appreciation for your continued support and coverage of Anambra State’s innovative ICT initiatives and the transformative work happening under the visionary leadership of Governor Charles Soludo. Your reporting on Anambra State’s technological advancements is much more than just news coverage – it serves as a beacon, illuminating the incredible journey the state is on. Your dedication to showcasing the positive impact of ICT aligns perfectly with Governor Soludo’s vision for a progressive and technologically advanced Anambra. Your work is a shining example of the power of journalism to inform and inspire. As our world becomes increasingly reliant on technology, your role as a journalist is more important than ever. By telling the stories of Anambra State’s ICT initiatives, you are bridging the gap between the Agency and the people it serves. Your coverage helps us all understand and engage with the transformative work that is happening. As we continue to push the boundaries of innovation, we want to thank you for your indispensable role in helping us share, celebrate, and inform the public about these exciting developments. I am honored to have you as a partner on this journey, and look forward to continuing to work together to promote the continued growth and success of ICT in Anambra State. Thank you again for all you do, I am grateful for your efforts in championing the advancement we are making.”",
