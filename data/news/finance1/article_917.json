    "text": "It feels brilliant to be part of a business that does things its own way and achieves fantastic results while doing so.\nThat’s how you’ll feel as a Stock Assistant with Aldi.\nIt’s a really fast paced environment, so there’s certainly no risk of getting bored. And everyone here understands exactly what needs to happen to make their store a success – and gets on with doing it. But the team is fairly small, so if you’re not contributing it will soon show.\nTime will fly by as you work hard to keep stock losses to a minimum, help out with inventory counting, check off deliveries and ensure the shelves are fully stocked with attractive, well presented products. And, of course, you’ll provide excellent customer service at all times by attending to customer needs in a prompt and friendly way.\nReference: 43462707\nPlease note\nReed.co.uk does not communicate with candidates via Whatsapp, and we will never ask you to provide your bank, passport or driving licence details during the application process.
