    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO -- For 30 years, the Boulevard restaurant has served quintessentially Californian cuisine in San Francisco. Owner and Chef Nancy Oakes opened Boulevard in 1993 in the historic Audiffred building on the Embarcadero waterfront. \"I am shocked that it's 30 years. I really am,\" expressed Oakes. \"It sounds crazy, but I've really loved being here.\" \"There's sort of an opulence,\" the Boulevard's Executive Chef Dana Younkin adds. \"And then a lot of care, and curation of ingredients. But also, just like hospitality, just a really warm and fun environment to be in.\" Nancy is knows as a pioneering American chef and mentor. She's kept the Boulevard menu fresh and creative. \"I don't know if people really think the food has changed very much, but it has changed radically,\" explained Oakes. \"I would get very bored if I didn't also try to learn new things and experiment with them and bring them in.\" The menu is bursting with carefully curated flavors and of course, San Francisco seafood. \"It's a very collaborative kitchen,\" said Younkin. \"Everybody has to care along the way to make something awesome, because, you know, chef can come up with the idea, but like day in, day out the team is holding that, bringing it through to the guest.\" Oakes adds, \"When they come in. And they tell you...we got engaged here. And we met, we've been married 20 years, and we celebrate every anniversary here. And I mean, that's becoming a part of somebody's life. And you have to look at it as an honor.\" For more information, visit here .",
