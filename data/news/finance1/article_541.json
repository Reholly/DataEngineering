    "text": "On December 20th, after submitting proof of MSB registration completion, Enet Crypto Center Limited (hereinafter referred to as Enet) officially obtained the U.S. Fincen MSB license on November 15. This marks a further step in Enet's compliance journey, allowing it to legally conduct currency exchange business in the United States, further expanding its international development space. This establishes a solid foundation for serving global users and enables Enet to provide users with safer, compliant, efficient, and convenient digital economic transaction services Since 2018, the U.S. Department of Treasury and the Securities and Exchange Commission have repeatedly emphasized that MSBs (Money Services Businesses) include virtual currency exchanges and their managers. The regulated entities are businesses and companies related to financial services. The regulatory scope includes international remittances, foreign exchange, currency trading, ICO issuance, and management of prepaid projects. Operating digital asset-related business within the United States requires a license. Hence, Enetâ€™s possession of the license grants it legal status in the U.S., distinguishing it from other irregular platforms. Enet Exchange has always sought higher-level and broader development. As a global leader in decentralized exchanges, it is committed to breaking national boundaries and achieving global integration. Based on Enet's public blockchain technology, it aims to realize scenario implementations in various fields, including capital, digital asset management, digital asset payment, blockchain charity, blockchain gaming, blockchain entertainment, blockchain shopping, and blockchain community games, thereby creating a complete decentralized digital asset ecosystem. Holding a license is of great significance for current exchanges. Obtaining official permission from the respective countries reflects the strength and credibility of the exchange. For most exchanges, a license also acts as a natural barrier for selection. For users, Enet's compliant operation under regulatory conditions is a major advantage, meaning their investments will receive legal protection. Under official permission, Enet strictly meets local regulatory requirements and user protection regulations. Enet will continue to advance its compliance and globalization development, providing safe and convenient digital asset transaction services to more global users. It also calls on other platforms to join the regular development path, contributing to the industry's progress and hoping to achieve industry compliance consensus.

It is strongly recommended that you practice due diligence (including consultation with a professional financial advisor) before investing in or trading securities and cryptocurrency.
