    "text": "It’s an inevitable part of Christmas. With joy in the air and mistletoe hanging, we’ll inevitably see some more engagement rings featured on our social media timelines. It is the most wonderful time of the year after all!\nBut just how much do you spend on an engagement ring?\nTo give you some idea, Bespoke Diamonds Ireland have published the results of their latest survey which shows exactly how much, on average, each county in Ireland spends.\nWhile the average spend in Wexford put us third lowest in Ireland, the Model County also saw one lucky couple spend the third highest amount on a single engagement ring.\nNationally, the average spend on an engagement ring comes in at €4,810. Wexford’s spend comes in less than that at €3,557. Only Kilkenny (€3,465) and Roscommon (€3,458) saw a lower average spend.\nThe average diamond carat weight for a ring in Wexford was 1.1ct.\nThe county with the highest average spend in Ireland was Galway with €6,425, followed by Cork (€6,325) and Limerick (€5,325).\nThere was some retribution for Wexford, however, as the Model County saw the third most expensive ring purchased according to Bespoke Diamonds’ data.\nThe most expensive ring purchased in the country was in Cork for €52,000. This was followed by a €39,500 ring in Dublin and then a €31,000 ring purchased by a couple in Wexford.\nThe happy Wexford spent big on a “bespoke designed three stone engagement ring with a natural oval centre stone and a complimenting stone on each side”.\nThe figures published by Bespoke Diamonds shows that an oval cut diamond remains the most popular and that 51% of rings are chosen by couples, while the man/one partner makes the choice in 49% of cases.\nGet ahead of the day with the morning headlines at 7.30am and Fionnán Sheahan’s exclusive take on the day’s news every afternoon, with our free daily newsletter.",
