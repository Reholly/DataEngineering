Once your monthly needs are known, you can then choose a straightforward plan to stay on track. One popular plan is called the 50/30/20 budget. It makes room for both needs and wants and is simple to understand and implement: - 50% of take-home pay covers needs like housing and groceries - 30% covers wants, like dining and travel - 20% covers savings and debt repayment With this plan, [consumers know where their money is going plus it allows for a little fun.](https://www.bankrate.com/banking/what-is-the-50-30-20-rule/#thirty) Any monies unspent or received unexpectedly, like a gift or a bonus, can be funneled into savings and investments.
