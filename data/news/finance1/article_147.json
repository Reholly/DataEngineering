    "text": "Lately, it's become a new custom when wandering by a real estate office to stop and grab a daily dose of disbelief as you look through the modestly-sized houses selling for the price of small mansions.\nThis new tradition has become a great replacement for the classic scary movie, or murder-mystery thriller, to replace your annual source of shock therapy.\nToday's top videos\nHere we recap the five most expensive homes in Ireland that sold this year and - spoiler alert - not all of them are based in Dublin...\n1. Bushey Park House Bushey Park House. Pic: Ireland Sotheby‚Äôs International Realty Coming out on top is Bushey Park House in Enniskerry, Wicklow. This Georgian mansion owned by singer Chris de Burgh sold for an eye-watering ‚Ç¨9.399 million.\nThe property was originally offered for ‚Ç¨12.5 million when it entered the market in June 2019 before a fifth of the asking price was slashed to ‚Ç¨9.85 million. The house, which is located over a kilometre outside of Enniskerry is located on a 27-acre plot of land, consisting of eight bedrooms, over 25,685sq ft.\nPic: Ireland Sotheby‚Äôs International Realty The singer purchased the property in 1996 and spent over seven years refurbishing his place which now includes a lift, a panic room, a restored set of stables and a guest cottage on the grounds, along with a tennis court, walled garden and leisure complex with an indoor pool.\n2. 71 Merrion Square With Merrion Square on the doorstep, this property certainly ticks the Location, Location, Location box! Pic: Getty Images Of course, it wasn't going to take long for Dublin to crop up on the list, and 71 Merrion Square sold for ‚Ç¨9,246,550 in June.\nDermot Desmond, the well-known financier, was the owner of this Georgian property who purchased it in 2000 for an original ‚Ç¨7 million. The lucky new owners can enjoy a renovated house, with Dermot having spent in the region of ‚Ç¨5 million upgrading the property, according to the Irish Times.\nNumber 71's new owner is understood to be Glen Dimplex chairman, whose home is coincidentally fourth on this list.\n3. Paddock Wood @sherry_fitz Welcome to Paddock Wood, Killiney Hill Road, Killiney, Co. Dublin ‚ú® A spectacular curved and glass walled hillside sanctuary! Among many other things, the architectural masterpiece features superb sea views, infinity pool, and a custom built golf practice area üåä‚õ≥Ô∏èüè° #sherryfitz #irishproperty #realestate #dublin #architecture #panoramicview #seaview ‚ô¨ New Beginnings - ZydSounds Located in Killiney, Dublin, this contemporary mansion sold for ‚Ç¨8.5m. Sold by Sherry FitzGerald, this mansion looks like one of the cliffside sprawlers found in LA rather than on Dublin's southside stretch.\nBased on 1.5 acres of manicured gardens, this property is glass-centric, with an infinity pool, and a six-hole golf putting green. Having sold in August, the original asking price is believed to have been ‚Ç¨9.75m.\n4. Drumleck House We told you this one would be popping up again. Drumluck House located in Howth was sold by estate agent Gallagher Quigley for ‚Ç¨7.5 million in October.\nPic: MyHome.ie The mansion located on the scenic cliffs of Howth has five bedrooms, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, an entertaining space, and Italian-esque style gardens.\nPic: MyHome.ie Having originally appeared on the market for an asking price of ‚Ç¨10 million, it is understood the Glen Dimplex chairman's home has been bought by an Irish family.\n5. 24 The Burbidge The Burbidge property goes down in Irish property history as the most expensive apartment ever sold at a whopping ‚Ç¨6,999,999.\nLansdowne Place, Ballsbridge Dublin 4. Pic: Lansdowneplace.ie The 3,454sq ft penthouse has been purchased by an Irish businessman and joins the ranks of Rod Stewart and Roy Keane as owners in the luxury building. On the seventh floor at Lansdowne Place, the penthouse consists of three bedrooms which all have ensuite bathrooms and walk-in wardrobes.\nLansdowne Place, Ballsbridge Dublin 4. Pic: Lansdowneplace.ie The penthouse's building also features a round-the-clock concierge service, a fitness suite, a morning lounge, and a formal meeting room which can double as a dining space for dinner parties.",
