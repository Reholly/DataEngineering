    "text": "WealthUp Helps Provide Financial Education for Everyone WealthUp\nRiley Adams, CPA\nWealthUp is a place for people of all ages to learn about money, discover their financial selves, and develop the skills they need to grow their nest egg.\nPLEASANTON, CALIFORNIA, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, December 28, 2023 / EINPresswire.com / -- The fast pace of technology and change in the financial world means people have more money-focused tools at their disposal than ever. But one thing remains the same:\nMost people are woefully under-educated about managing their finances.\nEnter WealthUp —a website started in 2018 to provide comprehensive resources and expert insights to anyone looking to take control of their financial futures.\nRiley Adams, CPA is the founder and CEO of WealthUp. And he built the site to help Americans fix one of the costliest problems most people suffer from: low financial literacy.\nConsider this: Roughly 60% of Americans have some sort of credit card debt, and nearly a quarter say they're falling deeper into that debt each month. About 5 million Americans are behind on their mortgage payments. And the average person graduates from college with tens of thousands of dollars in student loan debt.\nBut less than a third of American children enrolled in public schools have access to financial literacy classes. And that’s an improvement—far fewer adults had exposure to those kinds of classes when they were in school.\nWealthUp aims to change that by providing clear, accessible information about all aspects of personal finance, including:\nSpending\nSaving\nBudgeting\nInvesting\nTaxes\nReal estate\nRetirement\nFinancial tools\nAnd much more\nWhen a reader visits the website, they’ll be able to learn just about anything—from teaching a child about money and finding the best debit card for a teenager to opening a retirement account and figuring out how to save on their taxes.\nImportantly, no matter how complex the topic is, Adams helps readers understand these concepts with plain-English articles and practical examples.\nWealthUp also goes above and beyond by also providing objective ratings and reviews of financial products, from debit and credit cards to brokerage accounts to tax software, and more. Readers can understand the information—and trust it—because the site presents data in a number of ways, including detailed write-throughs, quick pros and cons, and comparison tables. This in turn helps each reader wisely choose the best apps, software, and services for them.\nWealthUp can also help readers keep up with the latest advances in financial technology. The overlap between technology and finances has never been greater—and Adams believes the only way people of any age can get ahead is by knowing how to not only manage their money, but successfully navigate the latest financial apps and software.\nWhat sets WealthUp apart—and has drawn millions of readers to its articles—is the site’s commitment to serving its readers. The site boasts hundreds of articles that are regularly updated to reflect the most recent information, product updates, and consumer perks.\nAdams’ site is an invaluable resource for children, teens, adults—anyone looking to get a firmer grip on their finances. So whether a reader is looking to take their first step toward a financial education, or sharpen up their existing skills, WealthUp is one of the first places they should visit.\nRiley Adams, CPA\nWealthUp",
