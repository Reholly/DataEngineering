    "text": "If you are looking for cheap tokens with high potential for ROI, [Borroe Finance ($ROE)](https://borroe.co/bit243), Polygon (MATIC), and Arbitrum (ARB) should form part of your portfolio. While $ROE prepares to deliver over 100% returns to investors, MATIC and ARB gave double-digit ROIs in late 2023. Keep reading to see expert opinions and forecasts on these tokens. Borroe Finance Prepares to Deliver Triple-digit ROI in 2024 As a beginner cryptocurrency investor, investments like [Borroe Finance](https://borroe.co/bit243) are a low-hanging fruit for you. For context, Borroe Finance is the world’s first decentralized AI-powered fundraising platform built to allow web3 businesses to raise instant cash by selling future earnings at discounted prices. As a DeFi funding platform, Borroe Finance will help close the short-term liquidity gap in the web3 industry. $ROE is currently in its third presale stage, and the token is selling for $0.0175. When all presale stages conclude, $ROE will hit the crypto market and sell for $0.04. This price movement will deliver a massive 128.6% ROI to early $ROE investors. Subsequently, analysts predict that Borroe Finance will record a quick market acceptance, leading to another price surge for $ROE. Therefore, $ROE may likely trade for $0.1750 by December 2024. Polygon Gets New Binance Listing on Christmas Day On December 25, Binance (the world’s best cryptocurrency exchange) announced a new Polygon trading pair to its Binance Margin platform. With effect from today, MATIC/FDUSD will be available for trading on Cross and Isolated Margins. In other news, WhaleAlert reported that an ambitious Polygon whale transferred 10 million MATIC tokens (approximately $7.8 million) from an unknown wallet to Coinbase on December 20. Even though the Polygon whale likely dumped these tokens, Polygon recorded a double-digit price surge in December. On December 18, MATIC traded at $0.7694. A few days before Christmas, MATIC gained 13.11% and sold for $0.8686 on December 25. Experts say Polygon bulls are firmly in the market, and the token will remain bullish until January. Therefore, MATIC will likely trade for $1.2130 by Q1 2024. Arbitrum-based Gaming Network Announces Airdrop On December 22, Xai, a layer-3 gaming network on Arbitrum, announced its season one token airdrop through its X platform. This airdrop is scheduled on Arbitrum on Wednesday, December 27, and will distribute XAI tokens to Xai Odyssey legendaries, vanguards, and sentry keys.

On December 18, ARB traded for $1.06. A week later, ARB gained 28.25% and sold for $1.37. According to analysts, ARB is one of the top altcoins set to surge in Q1 2024, thanks to its L2 relationship with Ethereum and recent ecosystem expansions. Experts predict that ARB will trade for $1.65 in January 2024.
