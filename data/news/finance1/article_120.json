    "text": "EINPresswire.com/ -- Making sure that every employee receives the prevailing wage on a government construction job may sound easy if the company has 2 or 3 employees. Add in 15 employees, 31 compliance issues, a variety of job titles for the same employee and flawless security regarding employee information, well, then a group of payroll people need to handle the job.\nOr… a web-based system that seamlessly, finds any\nDavis Baconcompliance issues and alerts the payroll manager about errors that could lead to jail time or heavy fines. That same system offers a 3-minute payroll. Would a huge savings of time and money compared to a manually prepared payroll be a smart choice for a construction company that does business with the government?\nA worry-free payroll system for\nconstruction companiesdoing business with the federal government is available.\nCompliant Client by eMars was created in 2001 to give construction company owners an easy, flawless, paperless way to be compliant with the Davis Bacon Act of 1931 that enforces a prevailing wage and 31 other compliance issues. This congressional act requires private contractors to be in compliance with each check paid to employees on all federally funded construction projects over $2,000.\nCompliant Client was designed with input from the Department of Labor and government contractors. Government auditors are given a portal to view the progress of every project. A real-time environment was created to block contractors from altering pay rates then submitting payroll.\nConstruction companies need this type of system to stay in compliance with the Davis Bacon Act.\nMany construction companies, however, prepare their payrolls manually. Humans make errors.\nCompliant Client by eMars is used by many construction companies.\nMore than 48,000+ users are handling projects in 45 states, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico use Compliant Client. This system processes between 2,000 and 3,000 payrolls a day. Some payrolls have thousands of workers. Other payrolls have as few as 15 employees.\nCompliant Client provides immediate, concurrent, real time visibility of all payroll records of the sub, prime, plus - the owner agency. All screens are printable via this paperless system. Every submitted payroll is audited, online and in real time. The results are instantaneous, allowing for immediate corrections.\nA typical payroll is prepared by 1 person in less than 3 minutes.\nCompliant Client requires a PC and about 30 minutes of training. Complete implementation takes less than 1 day. Users report an 80% productivity improvement over manual payrolls.\nCompliant Client also encrypts its at rest data.\n\"Security is tantamount\", says Woody Chamberlain, President of eMars/Compliant Client.\nMr. Chamberlain continued: “Users have a choice of 13 different security roles. Each role enables the user to perform defined processes.”\nEasily stay compliant with the Davis Bacon Act of 1931.\nEncrypted. Strong. Easy to use. Web based. Fairly priced.\nWoody Chamberlain\neMars / Compliant Client\n+1 480-595-0466\nemail us here",
