Protective effects of isoespintanol (monoterpene isolated from Oxandra cf. xylopioides) on changes induced by HFD were evaluated. Animals were maintained for 21 days with a standard diet (C), 10% fructose (F), and F plus isoespintanol (FI, 10 mg/kg, i.p.). Glycemia, triglyceridemia, total and HDL-cholesterol, and insulin resistance index (IRX) were determined. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IGTT) was performed. In the liver, we measured glycogen, lipogenic gene expression (SREBP-1c, GPAT, FAS, and CPT1), oxidative stress (GSH and 3′-nitrotyrosine content), inflammation markers (iNOS, TNF-α, and PAI-1 gene expression; iNOS and COX-2 protein levels), p-eNOS, p-Akt, and p-GSK3β protein levels. Isoespintanol corrected enhanced triglycerides, lipogenic genes, and IRX, and reduced HDL-cholesterol induced by HFD. Increased liver glycogen and inflammatory markers and decreased GSH, p-Akt, and p-GSK3β measured in F rats were reversed by isoespintanol, and p-eNOS/e-NOS and iNOS/GADPH ratios were normalized. Isoespintanol restored glucose tolerance (IGTT) compared to F rats. These results demonstrate for the first time that isoespintanol prevents endocrine–metabolic alterations induced by HFD in prediabetic rats. These effects could be mediated by Akt/eNOS and Akt/GSK3β pathways, suggesting its possible use as a therapeutic tool for the prevention of diabetes at early stages of its development (prediabetes).",
