    "text": "CARLYLE Each year E. Bourassa and Sons in Carlyle hold a toy drive for the local food bank. Although they already collected many items for this, they felt they could do more and wanted to do something different this year. The idea for a fundraiser was born out of the Weyburn branch being challenged by another business. Karley Hislop brought the idea forward to the group, and Carlyle's Bourassa branch decided to try a similar activity. On Dec. 6, the challenge began with Bourassa purchasing 24 items or more for the Carlyle District Food Bank, by which they challenged three other local businesses to purchase 24 items for the food bank and gave them 24 hours to bring the items to the branch. These three businesses would then nominate a business or two of their choice to do the same. This went on until Dec. 15 in the afternoon when the challenge was completed and items were delivered to the food bank. The challenge took off like wildfire and escalated into something much bigger than was anticipated. The organizers were overwhelmed with the success. Tina Renner, administrator for E. Bourassa and Sons said 63 businesses accepted the challenge with many of them bringing in much more than 24 items. Renner and E. Bourassa thanked all the businesses that took part in this challenge, making it such a success. Over 1,600 non-perishable and hygiene items were received and delivered to the food bank. The branch said they plan to continue with the challenge in the future as Carlyle knocked this one out of the park. E. Bourassa and Sons began their business in Carlyle in April 2018. The local office just celebrated its fifth year and now has 13 employees.",
