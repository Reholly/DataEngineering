    "text": "Tesla could announce a factory in India early next year, according to a local media report. Elon Musk is expected to join Vibrant Gujarat in Gandhinagar where he will make an official announcement. Several Indian media [reported](https://x.com/Ktri58978804/status/1740291060897649133?s=20) on Thursday that Tesla is in the final stages of negotiations with the government over land to be used for the factory site. Gujarat state media reported that Tesla is eyeing land in Sanand, a city and municipality in Ahmedabad district. It is the central industrial center of Gujarat. Other automakers like Maruti Suzuki, Tara Motors, and MG Motor are already located here, meaning there is a ready-made supply chain that operates in the area. It is worth keeping in mind that at the moment, there has been no official information confirming this rumor. BIG BREAKING NEWS ‚Äì Elon Musk's Tesla to set up its first India factory in Gujarat, announcement likely during Vibrant Gujarat event in 2024 üî•üî• PM Modi & Elon Musk both will be present at the event ‚ö°. 5 lakh cars will be manufactured annually with prices beginning from Rs 20‚Ä¶ [pic.twitter.com/tZjWuWCpLv] ‚Äî Times Algebra (@TimesAlgebraIND) [December 28, 2023] Gujarat Health Minister and government spokesman Rushikesh Patel emphasized the alignment between Tesla‚Äôs goals and the state‚Äôs aspirations. Speaking at a Cabinet briefing on Thursday, he expressed considerable optimism that Elon Musk would consider investing in Gujarat, highlighting the government‚Äôs welcoming stance. Tesla and India have been in talks for the company to enter the local market for years. Several times they even came close to reaching an agreement, but ultimately it was never reached. This year, India has made moves to attract investment, paving the way for talks with Tesla again. It was reported that the company‚Äôs delegation met with the government several times to negotiate. In the summer, Elon Musk met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New York, USA. After the meeting, it became known that Musk plans to visit India in 2024, with Tesla likely to make a ‚Äúsignificant investment in India in the future,‚Äù as he stated.
