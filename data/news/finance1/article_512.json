    "text": "üìÜ Thursday, January 4th üéü $20 üìç El Coraz√≥n: 109 Eastlake Ave E, Seattle What Taylor Swift (and Beyonc√©) have done for the economy this last year with their tours might have kept us out of a recession. That‚Äôs a cheeky thing to say, but also the Taylor Swift Impact created an economic boost on 53 nights in 20 locations‚Äîa [ five-month, five-billion-dollar shift](https://www.ustravel.org/news/taylor-swift-impact-5-months-and-5-billion). Then there was the ‚Äú [Swift Quake](https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/27/entertainment/taylor-swift-seismic-activity/index.html),‚Äù where fans triggered an earthquake in Seattle. With that kind of momentum, consider starting 2024 with the touring Tay Tay Dance party at El Coraz√≥n in Seattle‚Äôs Cascade neighborhood. Join DJ Swiftie for a two-hour party ‚ÄúTaylor-made‚Äù for Swifties. Expect hits from every era‚ÄîLover, Fearless, Evermore, Reputation, Speak, Now, Red, Folklore, 1989, Midnights, and whatever else I‚Äôm forgetting. This all-ages event includes a laser show to accompany the setlist, which spans Swift‚Äôs almost 18-year career and ten studio albums. Whether a fan or hater, Swift is so damn honest you can‚Äôt help having at least a little admiration. Dance tip: Try Taylor‚Äôs signature dance move, [The Mom Croon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdaEBbqL5V4&ab_channel=TaylorSwiftVietnamFC), which is about feeling IDGAF because the beat has you caught up. Let go and succumb to the lavender haze. üíå Be Our Pen Pal! Find out what‚Äôs happening in Seattle by [subscribing to our newsletter](https://theticket.seattletimes.com/newsletter/).",
