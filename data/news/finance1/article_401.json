    "text": "TUKWILA, Wash. — Whether you're a frequent or a first-time flyer,\nAlaska Airlines always wants you to have a good flight. One of the ways they do this is by rotating the food and drinks passengers eat once onboard.\n\"We like to keep things fresh. We like to make sure that our guests have various rotations throughout the year that they can pick from for our repeat travelers that they're not getting the same thing,\" said Jessica Johnston, Food and Beverage manager for Alaska Airlines. \"We really put a focus on making sure that we're partnering with small West Coast companies, whether it be Browne or anything else up and down the West Coast.\"\nOne of those local partners is\nBrowne Family Vineyards out of Walla Walla. Hal Landvoigt from Browne has been with the company from the beginning.\n\"Our first year, 2003, Andrew and I in the cellar put together a 400-case cabernet blend and we've grown since then tremendously,\" Landvoigt said. \"We're the largest family-owned winery in Washington state.\"\nAlaska Airlines is now featuring two of Browne's wines on their flights.\n\"The Chardonnay is the white wine. Chardonnay is obviously the most popular grape in the world so one of the world's most popular wines,” Landvoigt. \"The red is a Syrah and merlot red blend. So, two grapes that have done really well in Washington since the beginning of Washington vivaculture.\nIf you'd like a meal with your wine, Alaska has something new on its menu.\n\"A couple of new dishes we're excited about are the chicken served in the cilantro lime rice, with fried plantains, and the delicious jerk sauce. We also have our Mediterranean lentils. This is our vegan and gluten-free option this year. Lentils on the bottom sitting on top of cauliflower and marinated roasted grilled onions and red peppers,\" Johnston said.\nWhich wine goes best with your in-flight meal?\n\"So, the jerk chicken that I mentioned, would go well with a generation Chardonnay, and then the Mediterranean lentils we would certainly pair with the red blend.\"\nSo, if you love good wine and good food, you'll find both up in the sky.\n\"Whether it is the beginning of a business trip for them or the beginning of a vacation that they saved for a lifetime to take. It's exciting to keep things fresh for our guests,\" Johnston said.\n[KING 5's Evening](/evening) celebrates the Northwest. Contact us:",
