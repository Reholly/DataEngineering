    "text": "Simone Inzaghi believes Inter Milan can head into 2024 with plenty of enthusiasm as his side aim to finish the campaign with more silverware.\nThe Serie A leaders return to action after the Christmas break at Genoa on Friday night for their final match of the year.\nWhile there was disappointment in defeat by Manchester City in the 2023 Champions League final, Inter lifted both the Supercoppa Italiana and Coppa Italia.\nSimone Inzaghi’s comments on the eve of\n[#GenoaInter] [#ForzaInter]\n— Inter (@Inter_en)\n[December 28, 2023]\nInzaghi feels Inter can continue to build on progress over the past year as they look to maintain the pace at the top of the table and also make an impact again in Europe, having been drawn against Atletico Madrid in the Champions League last 16.\n“2023 has been very satisfying. We’ve won a couple of trophies and played a very exciting Champions League final,” Inzaghi told Inter TV.\n“It’s nice not to forget what we’ve achieved, but we have plenty of ambition and are looking ahead to the new year with plenty of enthusiasm. We want to go far together with our fans.”\nWith El Toro seemingly heading into the new year atop the\n[#SerieA] [@cryptocom]top scorers list, how do you think this will look come the end of the season in ? [pic.twitter.com/TwIgZMIGfQ]\n— Lega Serie A (@SerieA_EN)\n[December 28, 2023]\nInzaghi added: “We are happy with our numbers from the first 17 matches. We still have 21 games to play and will need to maintain our excellent attacking and defensive numbers.\n“The secret is the real willingness that all the players are displaying.”\nInter should have French defender Benjamin Pavard available again for the trip to Genoa, but Lautaro Martinez, Federico Dimarco and Juan Cuadrado remain out injured.\n“The rotation of the squad needs to be a solution and mustn’t become a problem,” Inzaghi said.\n“It is something that has served us well during periods where we have had so many matches in quick succession.”\nWorking Day\n[pic.twitter.com/jwH4OOFklj]\n— Genoa CFC (@GenoaCFC)\n[December 23, 2023]\nGenoa held Juventus to a 1-1 draw in their last home game and Inzaghi is expecting a stern test against the Rossoblu.\n“It will be a hard-fought game,” he said. “Genoa are in good form and have high-quality players and a well-prepared coach who is doing well.\n“We will have to be shrewd and play with real intensity.”\nGenoa coach Alberto Gilardino hopes his side can produce another positive display to build on their win at Sassuolo ahead of the Christmas break.\n“We face the strongest team in the championship, one of the best defences in Europe and a very good coach,” Gilardino said at a press conference.\n“We come to play this match after two positive results, so we must face this match in the best way.\n“We must not allow ourselves to lose even a millimetre in our approach.\n“The boys are eager to get a positive result and have a positive attitude in the match.”\nSoccer News Like\n- Be the first of your friends!",
