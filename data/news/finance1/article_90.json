    "text": "Our Dialpad vs Zoom comparison shows that Zoom is superior to Dialpad, as it offers more affordable subscription plans, powerful call management and artificial intelligence (AI) tools, and seamless connectivity with third-party apps. Dialpad, on the other hand, is an excellent choice if you need various business phone numbers. Upon completing our evaluation, we concluded that the best use cases for Dialpad vs Zoom are as follows:\nZoom: Better for streamlining unified communications Dialpad: Better for establishing a strong locational presence\nIf you want to focus more on handling phone calls, go for a voice-over-internet-protocol (VoIP) system with extensive call management tools. One with a centralized interface for accepting incoming calls and managing extensions’ presence.\nRingCentral: Best for efficient call management\nDialpad vs Zoom Compared\nMonthly Pricing\n$23 per user**\n$15.99 per user*\nFree Trial\n14 days\n✕\nFree Plan\n✕\n✓\nUnlimited Domestic Calling\n✓\n✓\nMulti-level\nAuto-attendant\n✓\n✓\nCall Analytics\nPowered by AI\nQueue analytics requires an extra fee (Zoom Power Pack)\nShort Messaging Service (SMS)\nIncludes international SMS\n✓\nUptime Guarantee\n100%\n99.999%\nSecurity Certifications\nLearn More\nFor More Information\n*Save up to 21% with annual billing.\n**Pay $15 only when you choose annual billing.\nBest Alternatives\nDialpad and Zoom are excellent\nunified communications solutions, but their limitations may be deal breakers for some businesses. If you’re looking for a platform with an extensive set of call management tools, a built-in customer relationship management (CRM) system, or affordable international calling plans, consider these Zoom and Dialpad alternatives: RingCentral: This popular business phone system is the best option for those handling large volumes of calls, given its robust call management features. Aside from the essential VoIP capabilities like call forwarding, call screening, and extensions, it features a Heads-up Display (HUD) that allows you to see active calls, take incoming calls on behalf of team members, and check user extensions’ statuses. Subscribe to RingCentral for only $30 per user monthly. Nextiva: If you want to streamline CRM activities like lead generation and nurturing, this is the ideal solution, as it has a built-in CRM tool that lets you customize sales pipelines. Sales agents track deals more easily and adjust strategies for pushing leads to the closing stage more effectively. The monthly subscription to Nextiva costs $30.95 per user. 8×8: This is the most suitable VoIP platform if you want to maintain communications with a global audience. 8×8 supports unlimited international calling to 48 countries, including Australia, China, Germany, Japan, Mexico, and Russia. Contact the provider to know their exact subscription rates.\nBest for Pricing: Zoom\nPlans are paid monthly; save 21% with annual billing. When you subscribe to Business Plus, you can mix types of plans in an account.\nPlans are paid monthly. Pay $15 and $25 per user for the Standard and Pro plans when you choose annual billing.\nIn the pricing battle between Zoom vs Dialpad, Zoom wins as it offers more affordable, flexible subscription plans. Its base-level package is $15.99 per user, while Dialpad starts at $23 per user. It can be argued that Zoom’s entry-level subscription doesn’t include business phone features, and companies must upgrade to Business Plus, which costs $25 per user to unlock the call management features.\nHowever, the difference between Zoom’s Business Plus and Dialpad’s Standard plans is minimal: $25 per user vs $23 per user monthly. Moreover, the Business Plus package offers the flexibility of mixing different types of plans in an account. If there are team members who won’t need VoIP features, you have the option to settle with lower-tier packages for specific users and enjoy cheaper rates.\nOn top of this, when you choose annual billing, you’ll secure $50 savings per user yearly with Business Plus. Similarly, Dialpad offers annual billing discounts. The monthly base-level subscription lowers to $15 per user (from $23) and the second-tier plan drops to $25 per user (from $35).\nBest for Virtual Phone Numbers: Dialpad\nEvaluating the virtual numbers offered by both solutions, we saw that Dialpad has a slightly better advantage than Zoom, given the types of numbers provided and country coverage. Dialpad offers local, toll-free, and vanity numbers, with one local number per user included in all subscription plans. It has local numbers in about 70 countries, including Germany, Mexico, Australia, the United Kingdom, and France.\nDialpad’s extension numbering has a maximum length of five digits. If you plan to keep your existing phone numbers, the provider offers number porting free of charge.\nSimilarly, Zoom offers local, toll-free, and vanity numbers. However, the vanity numbers are limited to toll-free, not local. Its country coverage for international numbers only includes 49 locations. But the extension numbering features a maximum length of six digits. It’s unclear whether or not Zoom charges for its number porting process.\nZoom alternatives. We have recommendations for different use cases, including streamlined project management, excellent audio and video quality, and large-scale meetings.\nBest for Call Management: Zoom\nTo settle the Zoom vs Dialpad debate on call management, we listed their shared and unique features, favoring the one with valuable capabilities for handling different volumes of inbound calls. We found that Zoom is superior to Dialpad for call management because it offers the options of metered and unlimited outbound calling and the ability to monitor and elevate conversations to a meeting.\nGiven Zoom’s metered and unlimited calling, businesses effectively manage communication costs depending on the present customer service demand. It features various call monitoring tools, such as whisper, barge, and takeover, enabling managers to evaluate agent performance in real time and provide coaching, if necessary. At the same time, moving a phone call to a meeting is useful for providing detailed, visual assistance for customer support.\nDialpad has unique call management features, which are hunt groups and unlimited ring groups. With a ring group, multiple team members’ phone numbers will simultaneously ring when an incoming call comes through, keeping you from missing any important calls. Hunt groups, on the other hand, locate the most equipped agent to handle a specific concern.\nWhile Zoom offers call monitoring tools in its unified communications subscription packages, Dialpad’s call monitoring tools are locked behind its contact center plans, which start at $80 per user monthly.\nBest for Artificial Intelligence: Zoom\nZoom bested Dialpad in the area of AI as it offers a broader range of tools that are beneficial for making different communications in various channels easier. The AI Companion for video meetings features meeting intent detection. When team members mention specific phrases in chats alluding to a future meeting, Zoom automatically displays a scheduling button. Similarly, it suggests and curates whiteboard ideas to help you kick-start brainstorming sessions.\nAfter the session, Zoom sends a meeting summary, detailing the key points of the discussion. The smart recordings are divided into smart chapters, so referring to certain information and listing action steps becomes faster and easier. On top of the AI tools for meetings, the provider has intelligent features for instant messaging and emails. Essentially, it offers reply recommendations.\nIf you plan to use AI for phone calls only, Dialpad is the better option. While Zoom is still working on AI applications for recorded calls, Dialpad already offers real-time call transcriptions and post-call summaries. The call summary includes a searchable transcript and Key Moments, which outline action items, sentiment analysis, and call purpose categories. Use this information to adjust communication strategies and agent training.\nBest for Video Communications: Zoom\nOn the aspect of video communications, Zoom had more robust features than Dialpad. For one, Zoom accommodates up to 1,000 attendees (Enterprise Plus plan) and 30 hours of duration in one meeting. Dialpad only allows a maximum of 10 participants and five hours of duration. Additionally, Zoom’s in-meeting collaboration tools are more extensive than Dialpad’s.\nWhile both share virtual backgrounds, chat, screen sharing, and reactions, Zoom takes its offering up a notch with spotlight and pin participants, co-host and alternate host, and meeting scheduler assignments. It allows users to launch polls and quizzes to increase engagement among attendees. Users have the option to enable the “original sound for musicians” feature to activate professional audio settings.\nDialpad’s unique video meeting features include the countdown timer and social profiles. The countdown timer tells participants how much time is left before the supposed end time of the session. Social profiles display an attendee’s company affiliation, email address, and CRM information.\nBest for Third-party Integrations: Zoom\nZoom is the clear winner for connectivity with external apps because it works with over 2,000 solutions. Regardless of the subscription package you choose, you have access to these third-party integrations. Some popular apps included in Zoom’s marketplace are Google Workspace, Slack, Microsoft Teams, Asana, and monday.com. Lead management becomes easier as Zoom links to Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive, Zoho CRM, and other CRM tools.\nOn top of the extensive range of apps, Zoom emerged as the winner in this round because when you choose the paid plans, you get access to premium Zoom apps for an entire year without extra charge. These include the game-based learning platform Kahoot, collaborative solution Coda, and Prezi Video.\nIn contrast, Dialpad only works with over 60 third-party business tools. You must upgrade to the higher-tier plans to unlock more integrations. The single sign-on solutions, for instance, are locked behind the most expensive plan, which comes with custom pricing.\nHow We Evaluated Dialpad vs Zoom\nTo objectively compare the software solutions, we listed criteria points representing small business priorities when selecting a unified communications solution.

A drop-down menu of contacts will appear if the text you type matches a record in your database.\nYes, Dialpad is better than Google Voice for streamlining call management with the help of AI tools. However, Google Voice is more suitable if you already use products from the Google Workspace suite, like Gmail and Google Meet, as the phone solution seamlessly integrates with such apps.\nYes, Dialpad is safe to use as it offers in-transit and at-rest encryption, allowing administrators to control access to specific features at a company, office, department, or user level.
