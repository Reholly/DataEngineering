    "text": "We may have just had Christmas less than a week ago, but another party event is fast approaching - Hogmanay. If you're planning to ring in the New Year, then chances are that you will be on the hunt for another bottle of bubbly. However, some of us might have been a bit over indulgent over the festive period and might need to head to the shops over the next few days. Luckily, partygoers can nab a bargain, as Lidl has today slashed the cost of its award-winning [Montaudon Champagne Brut](https://www.lidl.co.uk/p/montaudon-champagner-aop-brut/p178908) to under a tenner. Originally priced at £14.99, the supermarket's champagne is reduced to £9.99 for [Lidl Plus members](https://www.lidl.co.uk/c/lidl-plus/s10023095) - and there is a three bottle maximum for each customer. Lauded by experts, this budget bottle of fizz recently went toe-to-toe with some heavyweights in a blind taste test panel. The result found that six out of 10 participants thought Lidl's champagne was \"better than Moët & Chandon.\" Boasting delicate aromas of citrus fruits and a dry-finish, the supermarket's Montaudon Champagne Brut was also praised by Decanter magazine for its “real depth and complexity for the price.\" Meanwhile, Good Housekeeping called it the \"best budget champagne.\" Shoppers are not just winning on taste, but also price, as Tesco stocks a [75cl bottle of Moet & Chandon Brut Imperial Non Vintage Champagne](https://go.skimresources.com?id=76202X1529444&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tesco.com%2Fgroceries%2Fen-GB%2Fproducts%2F255245509&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailyrecord.co.uk%2Flifestyle%2Ffood-drink%2Flidls-champagne-better-mot--31762678) at £43 for regular shoppers and £35 for Clubcard members. It means that Lidl customers are saving themselves between £43 and £25 for a bottle of bubbly that matches the quality of the premium champagne house. A bottle of the prestigious champagne has also been slashed to £35 at [Amazon](https://amzn.to/3NHxGkJ) and [Sainsbury's.](https://go.skimresources.com?id=76202X1529444&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sainsburys.co.uk%2Fgol-ui%2Fproduct%2Fmo%25C3%25ABt-chandon-imp%25C3%25A9rial-brut-non-vintage-champagne-75cl&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailyrecord.co.uk%2Flifestyle%2Ffood-drink%2Flidls-champagne-better-mot--31762678) Either way, Lidl [shoppers](http://ord.co.uk/all-about/shopping) are still getting the cheaper deal for New Year's Eve this year. Join the [Daily Record's WhatsApp community here](https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/join-daily-records-whatsapp-community-31116469) and get the latest news sent straight to your messages. Louise Weise, Promotions Director at Lidl said: “Our customers rave about the quality of our Montaudon [Champagne](http://ord.co.uk/all-about/alcohol) Brut, so we were delighted that the results of the independent blind taste test confirmed what we already knew. Lidl Plus offers our customers amazing deals every single day and we wanted to celebrate with them by giving them an extra special discount this New Year’s Eve – but they better be quick as it won’t be on shelves for long!” The [ Montaudon Champagne Brut](https://www.lidl.co.uk/p/montaudon-champagner-aop-brut/p178908) will be available for £9.99 on the [Lidl Plus app](https://www.lidl.co.uk/c/lidl-plus/s10023095).
