    "text": "Feeling lucky?\nThe Powerball jackpot for the Saturday drawing rose to an estimated $760 million with a cash option prize of an estimated $382.5 million, lottery officials said Thursday. If someone wins the jackpot, it would be the sixth largest in Powerball history.\nThe Powerball was last hit on Oct. 11 and Saturday’s drawing will be the 34th since a $1.7 billion jackpot was won on a ticket sold in California, according to officials at the Massachusetts Lottery.\nTwo $50,000 prizes were won Wednesday on Quic Pic tickets sold at Fast Freddie’s in Beverly and Wellesley Variety in Wellesley.\nTo win the full estimated Powerball prize, all five white numbers must match plus the Powerball . The Wednesday Powerball drawing , which was not hit, was an estimated $685 million.\nPowerball tickets are $2 each and can be played in 45 states, including Massachusetts, Washington, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Players can purchase tickets up until 9:50 p.m. Saturday at Massachusetts Lottery retailers.\nDrawings are held every Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday at 10:59 p.m. in Tallahassee, Florida.\nThe winning $1.7 billion ticket earlier this year was sold at Midway Market & Liquor in Frazier Park.",
