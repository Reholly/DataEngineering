    "text": "ATLANTA — The Georgia unemployment rate fell in all of its regional commission areas, according to the Department of Labor. Heading into 2024, Georgia Labor Commissioner Bruce Thompson said each part of the state saw an unemployment decrease in November. “As we prepare to ring in a new year, Georgia’s future is bright,” Thompson said in a statement. “With holiday shopping and retail kicking back up, Georgia’s unemployment rates are dropping faster than holiday deals. Coupled with a soaring job market and a workforce ready to take on limitless opportunities, Georgia is well on the road to success.” According to the announcement, the Atlanta area’s unemployment rate was down to 3.1% from 3.5%, showing there’s just a few more percentages to go before it’s back at last year’s 2.7%. In terms of workforce, the number of people in the Atlanta regional labor force rose to 2,700,517, thanks to nearly 71,000 new people ready to work in 2023.
