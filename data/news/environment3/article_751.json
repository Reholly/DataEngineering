    "text": "We have more newsletters Show Me No thanks, close See our Privacy Notice Edinburgh-based wholesaler Bookspeed is increasing its warehouse capacity by more than 40% this summer.\nThe family-owned business has purchased the neighbouring building at its Salamander Yards site, where the company moved to in 2000.\nThe expansion will increase its warehouse and office space by 12,000 square feet. Following a refurbishment, the new space is expected to be fully operational from spring 2025.\nBookspeed was founded as a next-day books wholesale service almost 40 years ago. Today it supplies thousands of UK retailers with around two million books a year, operating within retail sectors such as gift, culture and heritage, visitor attractions and garden centres.\nCustomers include Oliver Bonas, Blue Diamond, the Natural History Museum and Fortnum and Mason.\nThe headquarters expansion is part of a wider strategy to increase the company’s capacity in order to meet demand.\nManaging director Lewis Dawson said: “It’s our mission to put more books into the world and a significantly expanded warehouse will help us do that.\n“This move opens up opportunities to work with a greater range of retailers and improve our service to our diverse range of fantastic customers.\n“We already have a strong reputation for shipping out orders quickly, thanks to our brilliant warehouse team, but this expansion allows us to further modernise our warehouse and introduce more improvements and efficiencies into what we do.”\nDon&apos;t miss the latest headlines with our twice-daily newsletter - sign up here for free .\nRead More Related Articles Bestselling authors back Edinburgh bookshop crowdfunder Read More Related Articles Champion Scotch pie recipe changes hands in butcher business deal\nStory Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks.
