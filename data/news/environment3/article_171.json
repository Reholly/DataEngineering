    "text": "A Public Health Hero: USU's Judy Sims Recognized for Dedication to Water Quality Over 50 Years By [Alyssa Regis](mailto:alyssa.regis@usu.edu) | Just how does one become an expert in onsite wastewater (septic) systems? For Judy Sims, the first celebration of Earth Day, held in 1970 was her inspiration. It sparked a lifelong interest in protecting human health and the environment. It also led her toward an education in environmental biology, and more particularly, the interaction of wastes and soils. \"I just started putting soil and waste together because not many people put those two fields together at the time,” Sims said. Drinking water supplies can become contaminated from wastewater in soils, and Sims focused her research on that interaction, with a focus on protecting public health and the environment. Sims came to USU as a research biologist in 1982, and she has been involved in on-site wastewater treatment research and applications ever since. Her research garnered recognition from Utah political leaders, who recognized the need for a wastewater training program to support sustainable population growth in the state. Sims was an integral part of the team that developed the “ [Utah On-Site Wastewater Treatment Training Program](https://uwrl.usu.edu/research/owt),” headquartered at the [Utah Water Research Laboratory](https://uwrl.usu.edu/). The program originated from a desire to increase awareness and provide training for septic system regulators, designers, installers, pumpers, homeowners and other stakeholders in the design, installation and operation of on-site wastewater treatment systems. It developed into the statewide professional training program that it is today. Sims has served as the Program's coordinator for 25 years. After 42 years of service at USU, Sims is being honored as a public health hero. The Bear River Health Department named Sims a 2023 Public Health Hero for Environmental Health Services at the Cache Chamber Leadership Luncheon on May 21. This award recognizes her outstanding dedication and contribution to the fields of environmental science and public health, and her commitment to protecting Utah’s valuable surface and groundwater resources. Sims received the call about her award while she was recovering from a severe and life-threatening illness. She said that the timing of the award seemed particularly touching for her. “It was really special to be recognized for all the work that I’ve put in for a long period of time,” she said. Sims has won several awards over the years in recognition of her work. In 2019, the Utah Division of Water Quality presented her with the Calvin K. Sudweeks Award for her leadership and achievement in the field of water pollution control and water quality improvements in Utah. Over all her years in wastewater and soils, Sims has continued to educate and inspire people coming through the training program, sharing practical knowledge that her students use daily. “That’s why this is so satisfying,” Sims said. “We’re teaching the people who are out there working in the field every day on septic systems, teaching them what they need to know, and I really enjoy that.” The Bear River Health Department expressed gratitude at the awards ceremony for all of Sims’s contributions to public health: “We are privileged to associate and learn from her knowledge and experience, year after year, as she trains and educates the future generations of public health professionals.” WRITER Alyssa Regis Communications and Outreach Specialist Utah Water Research Laboratory 435-797-1807 [alyssa.regis@usu.edu](mailto:alyssa.regis@usu.edu) CONTACT Judy Sims Coordinator, Utah On-Site Wastewater Treatment Training Program Utah Water Research Laboratory [judith.sims@usu.edu](mailto:judith.sims@usu.edu) Comments and questions regarding this article may be directed to the contact person listed on this page.",
