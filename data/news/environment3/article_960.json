    "text": "Ikos has brought its luxury all-inclusive offering to Corfu with its breathtaking new family hotel, Ikos Odisia.\nC&TH Guide to Responsible Tourism\nIkos Odisia, Corfu: Hotel Review\nHaving kids can really ruin your holiday fun. While precious annual leave was previously used for spontaneous adventures, or city breaks feasting on the best culture Europe has to offer, or hours spent snoozing on a sun lounger, now they come with a little person (or two or three) in tow – who invariably has their own, very specific, ideas about what a holiday should and shouldn’t look like (and it probably doesn’t involve reading the latest Sunday Times bestseller in the shade with an Aperol in hand).\nBut there is a middle way. Ikos has been redefining the luxury all-inclusive family holiday since 2014, when it first launched its Olivia resort in Halkidiki. Its latest offering, and second on the emerald island of Corfu, is Ikos Odisia, comprising 60 acres of beautifully designed rooms and villas, delicious F&B, impeccable service – and plenty to keep the whole family busy.\nSTAY\nThere are 390 rooms and suites to choose from at Ikos Odisia, from the beautiful pool-view balcony rooms, to the Deluxe two-bedroom bungalows with their own private swimming spots. These are all spread out over the 60-acre estate, and surrounded by lush, impeccably landscaped gardens, and a whopping 10 swimming pools (although some are for Deluxe guests only). Every room is luxuriously furnished with calming neutral tones, and comes stocked with luxurious Anne Semonin Paris products.\nEAT\nScattered throughout the resort (don’t worry, golf carts are available to get you from A to B) are its eight restaurants, ranging from traditional Greek cuisine, to crowd-pleasing Italian, to Peruvian fusion.\nWe were stupendously looked after at Elia, Odisia’s fine dining destination perched on the cliff overlooking the glimmering Ionian ocean. Sitting on its terrace, watching the sun set behind the mountains of Corfu, while feasting on contemporary versions of classic Greek dishes, made for an evening to remember. We also booked into Azul, the resort’s innovative Peruvian restaurant, for a mouth-watering change to the Mediterranean fare, washed down with Pisco sours.\nDay-to-day, for breakfast, lunch and dinner, there is also Flavors, a laidback, buffet-style restaurant that caters to all the family without compromising on quality or taste.\nDO\nFor many families, the most important thing about a holiday destination is the childcare on offer. Ikos Odisia offers a range of childcare services, from the creche to clubs for both kids and teens (including a football academy). Plus, there’s also babysitters to hire, and the resort offers 30 minutes of complimentary childcare on the beach or by the pool.\nOnce the kids are sorted, there’s a multitude of activities on offer for parents who feel up to leaving their sun loungers: complimentary gym classes; tennis, basketball and volleyball courts; water sports; and a luxurious spa offering a range of treatments by Anne Semonin Paris. In the evening, there’s live entertainment to be enjoyed alongside cocktails in the al fresco bar.\nIf you want to explore Corfu island a little more, the resort even has complimentary Teslas that can be booked for the day: The White House, the home of Lawrence Durrell in the 1930s, is only a half hour drive away.\nIf you fancy exploring Corfu Old Town, built in the Venetian style with tiny, winding, cobblestone streets interspersed with ornate Orthodox churches, then the resort runs a shuttle bus throughout the day. Once there, the NAOK Azur bar overlooking the Old Fortress and marina is the ideal place to sip a sundowner before dinner.\nFINAL WORD Ikos Odisia is carefully considered to provide the latest in family luxury, with an effortless, all-inclusive offer that caters perfectly to the whole family. With its gourmet dining, gorgeous grounds and impeccable service, it means that parents can have the holiday of their dreams – even with the kids in tow.\nBOOK IT ikosresorts.com\nAmy was on holiday when this review was conducted.",
