    "text": "June saw a wave of eco-conscious initiatives at many SM Supermalls in celebration of Philippine Environment Month, which coincides with World Bicycle Day on June 3, World Environment Day on June 5, and World Oceans Day on June 8.\nPedaling for the planet\nKicking off the month was World Bike Day with SM Supermalls’ ongoing Bike-Friendly program, initially launched to provide safe transportation during the pandemic. With over 6,500 designated bike parking slots (both indoor and outdoor) located nationwide, SM Supermalls encourages both sustainable urban mobility and a healthy and eco-friendly commute.\nSM Seaside City Cebu celebrates World Bicycle Day with a community fun ride.\nThe SM Mall of Asia bike parking and repair stand at the Entertainment Mall along Seaside Boulevard.\nA staunch partner in green initiatives\nFurthering environmental education, SM City Masinag hosted the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR)’s Loop Forward exhibit and learning sessions to equip mallgoers with the knowledge and tools to make a difference in waste management.\nThe Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR)’s Loop Forward exhibit and learning sessions open at SM City Masinag with (L-R): Antipolo City Mayor Casimiro Ynares III, Rizal 2nd District Congressman Emigdio Tanjuatco III, DENR Secretary Maria Antonia Yulo Loyzaga, and SM Supermalls’ Vice President for Corporate Compliance Liza Silerio.\nThe Loop Forward exhibit and learning sessions address plastic pollution’s impact, best practices, and sustainable consumption.\nEmbracing a waste-free future\nA major step was celebrated with the launch of the #SMWasteFreeFuture campaign by SM Prime. This comprehensive program aims to achieve significant waste reduction through effective segregation practices. By promoting the “Recyclable, Disposable, and Compostable” (RDC) system, SM Prime hopes to divert a greater portion of waste away from landfills and embrace a circular economy.\nSM Engineering Design and Development Corporation (SMEDD) President Hans “Chico” Sy Jr. (second from right), SM Supermalls’ President Steven Tan (right), SM Supermalls’ Vice President for Corporate Compliance Liza Silerio (left), and Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) Undersecretary for Policy, Planning, and International Affairs Jonas Leones (second from left) press the green light to launch the SM Prime’s Waste-Free Future initiative.\nSM Supermalls tenants join forces for a waste-free future, displaying informative Recyclable, Disposable, Compostable (RDC) posters.\nSM Prime held a series of learning modules for employees and tenants on proper waste disposal before the official launch. The pilot launch was held in SM Mall of Asia, followed by a rollout across all SM malls.\nThe SM Electronic Waste Collection Drop Box, which will be found in all SM Malls, is an easy way to responsibly dispose of old electronics, keeping them out of landfills.\nCleaning up our coasts with the DENR\nSM Cares partnered with the DENR for another successful Coastal Cleanup drive. With the help of volunteers and employees, over 15,000 kilograms of trash were collected from coastlines nationwide.\nSM Cares’ coastal cleanup, launched in 2014, expands year-on-year, reflecting its growing environmental advocacy and the power of community action.\nSM City Bataan volunteers keep our waters plastic-free.\nSM City Bataan volunteers keep our waters plastic-free.\nSM Prime’s multi-pronged approach to sustainability goes beyond individual initiatives and demonstrates a comprehensive vision for a greener future, incorporating alternative modes of transportation, responsible waste management, and active participation in environmental preservation. By empowering communities and promoting eco-conscious practices, SM Prime hopes to pave the way for a more sustainable future for the next generations.\nSM Cares is the corporate social responsibility arm of SM Supermalls, the country’s biggest chain of malls built by one of Southeast Asia’s leading real estate and property developers, SM Prime Holdings. SM Prime remains committed to its role as a catalyst for economic growth as it pursues the next horizon on integrated property development, and onward to building sustainable cities of the future while enriching the quality of life of the communities it serves.
