    "text": "Mumbai: Ohmium International, a US-headquartered developer of electrolyser systems for green hydrogen production, plans to double the capacity of its electrolyser manufacturing facility near Bengaluru to 4 giga watts (GW) by 2026, a company official said.Ohmium on Friday commissioned a new giga factory in Dodaballapura, near Bengaluru, which is ramping up to ship 2 GW of electrolyser systems a year.Electrolysers are the core equipment for green hydrogen production. They split water into oxygen and hydrogen using electricity – a process known as electrolysis. Green hydrogen is gas made by electrolysers using power from renewable energy sources and is essential for decarbonising industries.Ohmium designs, manufactures, and deploys advanced proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysers. It has two R&D centres in India – in Chennai and Bengaluru – besides its manufacturing facility in Karnataka.“As people place orders for now, 10s and 20s of megawatts at a time in 2024, we expect that might have our factory be something like 10% full. But what we see happening is that the sizes of projects are growing and next year, it's likely that orders are in the 100 to 200-megawatt range,” said Arne Ballantine, chief executive and cofounder of Ohmium International. “So, we feel that we’re right on time, having capacity to go to two gigawatts per year, and our cycle time to further double or triple is only two years,” he told ET.Ballantine said the company plans to continue to use India as an operations and engineering hub. “Our R&D centre is connected with IIT Madras and their tech park facility,” he said.The capacity of Ohmium’s current manufacturing facility is 500 MW.The new gigafactory is its second manufacturing facility in India, and its first to bring together key manufacturing, assembly, quality assurance, testing, warehouse and shipping facilities under one roof. “Ohmium’s unique hyper modular PEM electrolysers are designed for mass production and easy assembly,” said Ashwin Varma, chief operating officer of Ohmium.Ballantine said 2GW of electrolysers can abate four million tonnes of CO2 per year – equivalent to the CO2 captured by 180 million trees.The company said the new gigafactory represents major investment in local real estate, equipment and talent and is part of Ohmium’s consistent and growing track record of PEM electrolyser leadership in India – including its historic 400 megawatt (MW) deal with NTPC in 2023, its strategic partnership with Tata Projects in 2024, and its selection for the Ministry of Renewable Energy’s first round of Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition (SIGHT) Incentives.Ohmium’s research engagements with India’s CSIR-Central Electrochemical Research Institute (CSIR-CECRI) and IIT Madras Research Park (IITMRP) enable rapid transfer of innovation into production to meet the growing demand for green hydrogen projects in India and around the world, the company said.",
