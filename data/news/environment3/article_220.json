    "text": "Tips on keeping your AC unit at peak performance SHERMAN, Texas (KXII) - The long, hot month of August is approaching, meaning more work for your AC unit. “Your HVAC system is the most expensive appliance in your home and it utilizes the most amount of energy so one thing you want to do is one, it’s costly to repair, it’s costly to replace so doing your routine performance maintenance on your HVAC system is crucial, especially with this Texas Heat because it definitely puts it through its paces,” said Dana Bacon, the general manage of Crazy AC Guy. Crazy AC Guy has been serving Texomans for 16 years, they’ve stayed busy this summer partly due to a lack of consistency in caring for their AC unit. Bacon said you should have your system cleaned by a professional every six months. “When you have a dirty condensing coil or a dirty evaporator coil or a dirty filter on your HVAC system, it causes that system to work so much harder and it decreases your capacity, but it also increases your utility [usage, so](http://usage.so) it’s costing more to operate to be less comfortable.” Also make sure the condensing unit isn’t restricted anyway, by dirt or items or it’ll burn more energy, and keep the grass around it cut. “Basically how an air conditioner works, it’s absorbing the heat inside your home and releasing it outside. And if it’s restricted, if there’s an overhang over the top of the unit, it’s recirculating all that hot air that is discharged, it’s going to cause your amp draw and your compressor to work harder and it’s going to run hotter. So it’s going to burn more energy. And also if the coil is dirty and restricted, that also will cause the same scenario... [You] definitely wanna keep the grass clear around the condensing unit. You also wanna keep any dogs from urinating on the condenser because that will deteriorate the coil and lose efficiency and end up causing it to leak refrigerant,” said Bacon. Bacon said the best temperature to keep your thermostat on is 76 to 78 degrees when you’re away from home. If your AC isn’t working, Bacon said to first check your breakers and filter, then check your thermostat to make sure it’s set for cooling, and the indoor and outdoor fan to see if it’s moving air. If you can’t find the problem at that point, call a professional. Copyright 2024 KXII. All rights reserved.",
