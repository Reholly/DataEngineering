If sources are to be believed, to maintain a clean and green city, the consultant will review current sanitation practices and provide technical support and advisory services. This additionally includes assistance with procurement, document preparation, MIS report generation, and field support, as needed, to achieve the mission's goals. “We need to streamline the system to make the city clean and beautiful under the Swachh Bharat Mission.
