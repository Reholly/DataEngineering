    "text": "SINGAPORE - South Korean carmaker Hyundai launched its second made-in-Singapore electric vehicle (EV) on July 19, opening order books for a locally assembled version of its Ioniq 6 sedan. Four models are available: two with 55 kilowatt hour (kWh) batteries that need a Category A Certificate of Entitlement (COE), and two with 77 kWh batteries that need a Category B COE. Prices range from $192,150 to $244,850, including COE. Production began at the end of June at the Hyundai Motor Group Innovation Center Singapore (HMGICS) in Bulim Avenue. HMGICS, an advanced research and assembly facility in the Jurong Innovation District, is the Republic’s first EV factory. It was officially opened in November 2023. Assembly of the first locally produced EV, the Ioniq 5, began in early 2023. Both the Ioniq 5 and 6 take around 9.5 hours to produce. The factory also produces an autonomous version of the Ioniq 5 for US-based robotaxi company Motional. South Korean-made versions of the Ioniq 6 have been available in Singapore since July 2023, but will now be replaced by locally made ones. Unlike Hyundai cars that are made elsewhere but sold here, the new Ioniq 6 debuts a new feature that will be available for all Singapore-made models: Hyundai’s app-based Bluelink Internet-connected services. This allows users to update the car’s software over the Internet and use certain functions through voice control. Hyundai has not confirmed what other services Bluelink will provide in Singapore. In other markets, it allows users to remotely monitor their car, for instance, or to start the car and cool the cabin. Bluelink will also be available on future Singapore-made Ioniq 5 cars. Separately, Hyundai is expanding charging options for owners of its EVs. An agreement has been signed for SP Mobility to be the second provider of destination charging – that is, charging outside the home – for Hyundai owners. This is in addition to current provider Charge+. Hyundai’s flexible charging credit scheme with OCBC has also been expanded. Owners with an OCBC credit card will receive charging credits that can be used at 17 charge point operators in Singapore, up from seven previously. Local firm Power Up Tech will continue to provide mobile EV charging services, in which a vehicle comes to charge an owner’s EV on-site. Owners get a maximum of five charges a month, for up to 12 months. In addition to this, the company will now also provide assistance services such as emergency charging, 12-volt battery replacement and towing. THE BUSINESS TIMES",
