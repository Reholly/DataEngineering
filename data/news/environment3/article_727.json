KALIK, The Beer of The Bahamas, has begun transitioning its entire portfolio into eco-friendly craft cartons, replacing traditional corrugated cardboard.\nThe change marks a significant step towards reducing the brand's carbon footprint, leading to the most eco-friendly production process for this world-class Bahamian beer.\nThe new packaging, set to roll out over the next few months, will allow more of the brand's contents to be recyclable. Additionally, the low-cost material requires less water and energy for its production. Significantly, KALIK officials say this change will not affect the brand's brewing standards.\n\"KALIK is steadfast in our commitment to the cowbell, connection (inter-island), culture, and conservation,\" said Queswell Ferguson, Senior Portfolio Manager for Beers at CBL. \"This eco-friendly design change is a bold step towards prioritizing sustainability and fulfilling our commitment to conservation. We want KALIKERS nationwide to take pride in choosing a brand that cares for both people and the planet, and in protecting our nation's beautiful natural environment.\"\nClick here to read more on the Eye Witness News website",
