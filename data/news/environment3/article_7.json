    "text": "Columnist Russ Vernon-Jones: American Climate Corps — The CCC reborn\n|Published: 07-18-2024 4:08 PM|\nLast month, the first 9,000 members of the new American Climate Corps were\nsworn in and started work. This federal program is designed to train young people and engage them in new government-funded jobs in the clean energy, conservation, and climate resilience sectors. It’s modeled on the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) that FDR created as part of the New Deal in the 1930s. I’ve been a supporter of this new Corps since it was first proposed back in 2020.\nWhen I heard that one of my longtime favorite authors, the widely heralded Barbara Kingsolver, had written the pledge that the new Corps members would recite in their swearing-in ceremony, I was intrigued. The text of the pledge touched and charmed me. I wanted to share this pledge with Gazette readers and that led to this column.\nIn my early 20s I visited Great Smokey Mountains National Park as both a hiker and as a tourist. I slept in cabins, walked over bridges, and enjoyed spectacular views from overlooks, all of which had small plaques indicating they had been built in the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps. Eventually, I learned that the CCC had been one of FDR’s programs to put people into meaningful jobs at government expense in the midst of the economic crisis of the Great Depression. I was impressed that a program created to meet the unemployment crisis decades earlier was still providing the public with so many benefits.\nThis week I researched just a little of the history of the CCC and learned that they planted a vast number of trees, built thousands of dams, bridges, buildings, water supply systems, and built much of the infrastructure of the U.S. National Park System all over the U.S.\nNow we are in a severe climate crisis. Having the government get young people engaged in vital work to respond to the crisis makes a lot of sense to me. The idea was first proposed and pushed during the 2020 presidential campaign by the Sunrise Movement, the youth climate movement that played a key role in building support for the Green New Deal. Our own Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey, along with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, working with\nSunrise, introduced legislation that would fund and create the Climate Corps.\nHundreds of Sunrise young people visited their congressional offices, talked to everyone they knew, and put on over 100 rallies and actions in support of a civilian Climate Corps. They led three long marches across the country, blockaded the White House, campaigned for the Corps relentlessly, and built widespread support for the idea. Their skillful, persistent, sustained advocacy and organizing finally made a difference.\nIn September of 2023 President Joe Biden took\n[executive action]() to initiate the American Climate Corps — “a workforce training and service initiative that will ensure more young people have access to the skills-based training necessary for good-paying careers in the clean energy and climate resilience economy.” He committed to putting more than 20,000 to work “conserving and restoring our lands and waters, bolstering community resilience, deploying clean energy, implementing energy efficient technologies, and advancing environmental justice.”\nThese are a variety of paid positions ranging from a few months to over a year. They are funded through the Inflation Reduction Act and the federal budget. Most are designed to bolster local community efforts — installing clean energy, restoring habitats, weatherizing buildings, instituting climate-resilient farming practices, and more. All involve training and will prepare participants to go on to more permanent jobs in both the private and public sectors that will make a difference in the climate crisis.\nArticle continues after...\nYesterday's Most Read Articles\n[Elements Massage studio in Hadley abruptly closes after state order](/Hadley-massage-business-closed-56033365) [Amherst Town Council rejects candidate over tilt toward abutters](/Amherst-Town-Council-nixes-recommended-appointment-to-Planning-Board-over-candidate-s-views-56046392) [Area property deed transfers, July 18](/Area-property-deed-transfers-July-18-56040154) [Around the Hamptons: ‘Wild cows’ find way back to Easthampton home; local internet testing; Blueberry Supper in Westhampton](/Around-the-Hamptons-56028404) [Prominent immigration law firm in Northampton to close, affecting 30-plus employees](/CBK-immigration-to-close-at-the-end-of-July-56054087) [Music in the sky: Summit House Sunset Concert Series returns to its 173-year-old home](/summit-house-concert-series-july-13-55988054)\nBarbara Kingsolver is excited about the American Climate Corps. She\ndescribed the pledge she wrote this way: “In less than 100 words, I tried to bring in the most important parts of this initiative — that it’s about respecting and bringing justice to communities, it’s about respecting and honoring the environment and our connection with it, and it’s about taking a part in history.”\nHere is the pledge that the first 9,000 members of the American Climate Corps committed to last month. How much of this can we all commit to?\nI pledge to bring my skills, respect, and compassion to work every day, supporting environmental justice in all our communities.\nI will honor nature’s beauty and abundance, on which we all depend, and commit to its protection from the climate crisis.\nI will build a more resilient future, where every person can thrive.\nI will take my place in history, working with shared purpose in the American Climate Corps on behalf of our nation and planet, its people, and all its species, for the better future we hold within our sight.\nRuss Vernon-Jones of Amherst is a member of the Steering Committee of Climate Action Now (CAN).
