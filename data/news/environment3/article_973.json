    "text": "WSIL(Carterville, Ill.)-- This morning, most of us are waking up to similar conditions to what we saw yesterday. Temperatures area wide are in the upper 50s and low to mid 60s with mostly clear skies.\nAs we go through our Friday, you can expect to see very similar conditions to what we saw yesterday. Through the morning hours, most of us will see temperatures in the 70s. Dew points will once again run in the upper 50s and lower 60s, so it will feel very dry and crisp.\nHighs today will be slightly warmer, likely in the lower 80s for most of us. A few spots further south could see temperatures warm into the mid 80s, but those spots should remain isolated.\nSkies this morning will remain partly cloudy, but we will see less cloud cover through the day, and we should turn mostly sunny by lunchtime, and remain mostly sunny through the afternoon and evening. However, we could see a little more cloud cover in our far eastern counties across western Kentucky.\nOvernight, we will see partly cloudy skies, and partly cloudy skies are expected for most of the day on Saturday. Despite partly cloudy skies, we will remain dry through the day.\nHighs tomorrow will be in the low to mid 80s once again for most of us with mild dew points in the mid upper 50s and lower 60s again.\nAs we approach the second half of the weekend, we will see highs return to the mid 80s, and more humidity return to the area Sunday afternoon. With this, we will see isolated chances for showers and storms for the afternoon on Sunday.\nFor the start of next week, we will see an unsettled pattern take hold, with scattered rain chances expected everyday through Wednesday. Highs will continue to be mild and into the mid 80s.",
