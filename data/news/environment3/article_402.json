    "text": "Udhampur District Embraces Lavender Cultivation: A Boon for Farmers and Economy The Department of Agriculture in Udhampur, Jammu and Kashmir, has successfully cultivated five lakh lavender plants in Incha village. This initiative, aimed at doubling farmers' incomes and mitigating crop damage by monkeys, marks the first introduction of lavender farming in the region. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Updated: 19-07-2024 09:27 IST | Created: 19-07-2024 09:27 IST - Country: - India In a pivotal step for the agricultural landscape of Udhampur district in Jammu and Kashmir, the Department of Agriculture has cultivated around five lakh lavender mother plants at Incha village in Ramnagar tehsil. This marks the district's inaugural venture into lavender farming, a move supported by the region's favorable climatic conditions and soil composition. The department has utilized approximately 100 kanals of land in Incha village to grow these mother plants. These plants will be distributed to local farmers, providing them with a dual benefit. Not only will this initiative boost farmers' incomes, but it will also offer protection against crop damage caused by the prevalent monkey population, which has been a persistent issue. Lavender farming is set to revolutionize Udhampur's agricultural scene by offering a profitable alternative to traditional crops. Given the high market demand for lavender products, farmers can anticipate significant financial gains. Additionally, lavender's natural pest-repelling properties enhance its attractiveness as a crop choice. Anju Devi, a local resident, expressed her joy over the blooming lavender plants. She highlighted the role of government schemes in empowering women and noted that lavender farming presents a great opportunity for financial independence. Prior reliance on maize crops, often destroyed by wild animals, underscored the need for more profitable and resilient agricultural options. Rafiq Ahamed Jaral, SDM Ramnagar, emphasized the suitability of the region's climate for lavender cultivation. He mentioned a nursery has been established in Incha village, where five lakh lavender saplings have been prepared. These saplings will be distributed among farmers in the coming months. Saloni Rai, Deputy Commissioner Udhampur, outlined the 'Purple Revolution' initiative under which the lavender plantation is being carried out. She announced plans to prepare an additional five lakh lavender plants this year. The distribution of these mother plants aims to further boost farmers' incomes by encouraging lavender cultivation across suitable regions. (With inputs from agencies.)
