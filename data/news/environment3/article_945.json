    "text": "Rhode Island on Wednesday became the first state to achieve “built-out” status under the federal government’s $5 billion program to construct electric vehicle chargers along interstate highways. The state opened four new high-speed chargers at two park-and-rides along I-95 on Wednesday, funded by the bipartisan infrastructure law. With those chargers, the federal Joint Office of Energy and Transportation certified Rhode Island as the first state to [meet the Biden administration’s minimum standards](https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2023/07/the-long-road-to-bidens-electric-car-dreams-00104646) for the charging necessary to serve EV drivers along its major corridors. While Rhode Island’s highway network is small, it marks a significant milestone for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, which has been [beset by delays](https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2023/11/bidens-billions-for-ev-charging-has-yet-to-bring-a-charger-online-00128787) and [faced bipartisan criticism](https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2024/06/merkley-blasts-progress-on-ev-charging-infrastructure-00161778) for its slow rollout, including from GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump. The designation allows Rhode Island to spend the rest of its NEVI funds — estimated by the Joint Office at more than $22 million — to build chargers, including lower-speed chargers, at other locations of its choosing.",
