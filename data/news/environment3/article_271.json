Updated: 7:16 PM CDT Jul 18, 2024 WISCONSIN AND TODAY IS THE PERFECT DAY FOR FROZEN CUSTARD. I THINK SO, CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, WHETHER MARK IT CERTAINLY IS, YOU COULDN’T ASK FOR ANYTHING BETTER WITH THE SUNSHINE ALL DAY. AND THOSE COMFORTABLE TEMPERATURES. IF ANYTHING, SOME OF OUR FRIENDS HERE FROM THE SOUTHERN LOCALES OF THE UNITED STATES OR MAYBE OUT OF EAST AND WEST, THEY’RE PROBABLY THINKING IT’S A LITTLE CHILLY 71 DEGREES. YOU MIGHT NEED A JACKET LATER ON TONIGHT AS TEMPERATURES FALL PRETTY QUICKLY BACK DOWN TO THE 60S. SOME OF YOU WILL BE IN THE UPPER 50S OVERNIGHT. LIVE LOOK OUTSIDE. YOU CAN SEE OUTSIDE OF FISERV. ALL IS QUIET. LOOK AT HOW BEAUTIFUL IT IS. GLENDALE BLUE SKIES, BLUE WATER HERE. THE MILWAUKEE RIVER AND NO RAIN ANYWHERE IN SIGHT. AH, THIS WOULD BE A FUN THING TO DO. MAYBE PLAY A LITTLE GOLF 76 DEGREES, RIGHT NOW FROM OUR CAMERA AT LANDMARK. CREDIT UNION. LOOKING OUT OVER BROOKFIELD HILLS. MAYBE YOU WANT TO PLAY A LITTLE GOLF THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. COULDN’T ASK FOR MUCH BETTER WEATHER. NOW IT GETS A LITTLE STICKIER ON SUNDAY AND MONDAY, BUT OVERALL IT IS PRETTY GOOD. ALL RIGHT, LET’S GO TO THE WEEKEND. I KNOW WE STILL HAVE TO GET THROUGH FRIDAY, BUT SATURDAY NO PROBLEMS. SUNDAY, NO PROBLEMS. IT IS GOING TO BE GREAT THIS IS THE NICEST STRETCH OF WEATHER THAT WE’VE HAD SO FAR. THIS SUMMER. IT’S OUTSIDE TIME. FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY, MONDAY. HERE’S WHAT WE MEAN AS YOU CAN MAYBE TAKE THE DOG FOR A WALK TOMORROW. SUNNY ALL DAY LONG, LOW HUMIDITY. SATURDAY. BEAUTIFUL DAY. WE START TO CREEP THE HUMIDITY BACK UP A LITTLE BIT. TEMPERATURES WILL BE WARMER TOMORROW THAN WHAT WE HAD FOR TODAY. A LITTLE BIT MORE HUMID AS WE HEAD INTO SUNDAY. STILL LOOKS GOOD ON MONDAY. STILL LOOKS GOOD ON TUESDAY. NOW THIS IS THE BIG NUMBER. MAKES A DIFFERENCE IN A HUGE WAY. DEW POINT TEMPERATURES IN THE 50S. SUPER COMFORTABLE. STARTS TO GET A LITTLE BIT STICKY AS WE HEAD INTO SUNDAY AND MONDAY, BUT NOT OVERWHELMING. LOOK AT HOW NICE THESE DEW POINTS ARE EVEN DOWN INTO SAINT LOUIS AND LOUISVILLE. THESE PLACES THIS TIME OF YEAR, THEY DON’T USUALLY GET DEW POINT TEMPERATURES IN THE MID 50S. WE DO A LOT MORE THAN THEY DO 71 HERE, 96 IN GLASGOW, MONTANA. YEAH, WE’RE GOING TO START WARMING THINGS BACK UP, BUT NOT TOO BAD. OF COURSE THIS IS THE EXTENDED EXTENDED OUTLOOK. THE 8 TO 14 DAY OUTLOOK THAT TAKES US TO THE START OF STATE FAIR. YOU KNOW, WHEN STATE FAIR COMES AROUND IT’S GOT TO BE HOT. AND IT PROBABLY WILL BE AT TEMPERATURE. OUTLOOK DOES CALL FOR A PRETTY GOOD CHANCE. YOU’RE SEEING ABOVE AVERAGE TEMPERATURES SUN SUN AND MORE SUN ON FRIDAY. LET’S DO IT AGAIN ON SATURDAY. ANOTHER BEAUTY 8282 ON SUNDAY A MIX OF CLOUDS AND SUN ON MONDAY AND TUESDAY, BUT AGAIN, STILL LOOKING MAINLY DRY AS WE HEAD THROUGHOUT THIS FORECAST ALL THE WAY INTO THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK.
