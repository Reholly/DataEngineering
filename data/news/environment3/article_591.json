    "text": "The Chinese government has removed the long-standing barriers to the export of chicken and eggs produced in this country as well as pineapples to China. Minister of Agriculture and Plantation Industries Mr. Mahinda Amaraweera said that this agreement was expressed during the discussion with the delegation including Mr. Wang Lingjung, Deputy Minister of General Administration of Customs of the People’s Republic of China who recently visited Sri Lanka. Accordingly, Sri Lankan pineapple cultivators and exporters as well as poultry product manufacturers have been allowed to export as much poultry meat and eggs as well as pineapples to the Chinese market. The Ministry of Agriculture and Plantation Industries had to do a lot of work to remove the obstacles that existed in our country to export these agricultural products to the Chinese market. A number of methods had to be completed in order to confirm the quality of poultry products in the country’s market, especially the way pineapple is grown in our country. The Minister also said that due to the commitment made by the officials of the Ministry of Agriculture and Plantation Industries, the effort to get market opportunities from China has been successful for our country. Meanwhile, the Minister of Agriculture and Plantation Industry Mr. Mahinda Amaraweera said that the Chinese Deputy Minister assured that the Chinese government will work to expand China’s market opportunities to Sri Lanka in order to export whatever high quality agricultural products are in Sri Lanka.",
