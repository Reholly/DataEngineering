    "text": "lululemon is transforming its production practices by opting for a more sustainable approach. The brand's new Packable Anorak jacket is composed of enzymatically recycled polyester and captured carbon, aligning with the company's goal of shifting to 75% recycled polyester. Furthermore, the brand is dedicated to making 100% of its products \"with preferred materials, or those with improved environmental or social sustainability outcomes and impacts compared to conventional production, and end-to-end solutions to advance a circular ecosystem by 2030.\"\nThe innovative polyester used in this jacket is created through a blend of advanced bioprocessing technologies. Samsara Eco, a leader in enzymatic recycling, plays a crucial role in this process. Combining this with LanzaTech's captured carbon material, lululemon's Packable Anorak jacket is one of the newest examples of a modern fashion brand putting in substantial effort to create circular products.\nImage Credit: lululemon athletica\nlululemon Unveils a Jacket Made Partially from Captured Carbon\n[Kanesa David](/kanesadavid)— July 18, 2024 — [Eco](/eco)\nReferences:\nshop.lululemon& esgtoday\n6.7\nScore\nPopularity\nActivity\nFreshness",
