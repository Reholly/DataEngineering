    "text": "The Australian Ministry for Climate Change and Energy has announced that a total of twelve offshore wind projects, totalling 25 GW, have been given feasibility licenses in the Gippsland Offshore Wind Zone off Australia’s Victoria State. The Ministry has announced a second batch of six licenses, totalling about 13 GW, the first batch of six (12 GW) having been awarded in May 2024. Among the six new licenses granted are featured RWE’s Kent offshore wind project (up to 2 GW); Origin and RES’ Navigator North offshore wind project (1.5 GW); Corio’s Great Eastern offshore wind project (2.5 GW); BlueFloat Energy’s Gippsland Dawn offshore wind Project (up to 2.1 GW); Iberdrola’sAurora Green project and Ørsted’s Gippsland 02 project. Australia, which did not yet have offshore wind capacity at the end of 2023, has designated four offshore wind development zones, including Gippsland, to support the country’s 2050 net zero emissions target.
