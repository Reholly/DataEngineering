    "text": "Thicker, stronger hair this monsoon: Achieve your hair goals with these 3 natural nutrients While external factors like increased humidity and exposure to polluted rainwater can take a toll on your hair during the monsoon, focusing on internal nourishment can make a significant difference. Listen to Story As the monsoon season ushers in a welcome respite from the scorching summer heat, it also brings unique challenges for hair health. The increased humidity and exposure to rainwater can lead to hair problems, with studies suggesting that hair fall can increase by up to 30% during this season. This surge in hair loss is primarily due to elevated moisture levels causing hair follicles to swell and weaken, making them more susceptible to breakage and shedding. India Today spoke with Mihir Gadani, Biotechnologist and co-founder of OZiva to get more insights. Moreover, the monsoon creates an environment ripe for scalp issues. Rainwater, contrary to popular belief, often carries pollutants and harmful chemicals that can settle on the scalp, causing irritation and damage. The warm, damp conditions also provide an ideal breeding ground for fungal infections like dandruff, further compromising hair health. These factors combined make it crucial to pay extra attention to hair care this season. However, while external care is important, true hair health begins from within. You can maintain healthy, beautiful hair throughout the monsoon and beyond by focusing on three key ingredients - Biotin, Zinc, and Iron. These nutrients play vital roles in hair growth, strength, and overall health, providing your hair with the internal support it needs to withstand the challenging monsoon conditions. B7 AKA BIOTIN TO THE RESCUE: Biotin, also known as Vitamin B7, is a powerhouse nutrient for hair health. This essential vitamin plays a crucial role in the production of keratin, the protein that forms the structure of hair. During the monsoon, when hair is more vulnerable to damage and breakage, biotin becomes even more critical. Recent studies have shown that plant-based biotin, such as that derived from Sesbania Agati extracts, can significantly contribute to thicker, stronger hair in just a few months. Look for supplements that offer a high potency of biotin, ideally around 10,000 mcg per serving, to support hair growth and strength during the challenging monsoon season. Besides promoting hair health, biotin also supports healthy skin and nails, boosts immunity, and enhances energy and metabolism. ZINC, THE HAIR LOSS DEFENDER Zinc is an essential mineral that plays a multifaceted role in hair health. It supports a healthy immune system and is crucial for cell division - a process fundamental to hair growth. Moreover, zinc has been found to help block excess DHT (dihydrotestosterone), a hormone that can cause hair follicles to shrink and lead to hair loss in both men and women. During the monsoon, when the warm and damp conditions create an ideal environment for fungal infections on the scalp, zinc's immune-boosting properties become particularly valuable. Studies have shown that zinc derived from Guava Leaf extract can be particularly effective in strengthening hair follicles and nourishing hair roots. Consider incorporating zinc-rich foods into your diet or look for supplements that provide zinc from natural sources like Guava Leaf extract. The recommended daily intake of zinc is around 4% for optimal hair health benefits. THE SCALP OXYGENATOR, IRON! Iron deficiency is a common concern that can significantly impact hair health. This essential mineral is crucial for the production of haemoglobin, which carries oxygen to all cells in the body, including those in the hair follicles. During the monsoon, ensuring adequate iron intake becomes even more critical when hair falls tend to increase. Plant-based iron supplements can enhance iron absorption and red blood cell production, particularly those derived from sources like Curry Leaf extracts. Clinical studies have shown that iron extracted from Curry Leaf can provide up to 3.5% of the daily recommended intake, effectively improving oxygen supply to the scalp. This improved oxygenation can promote hair growth and overall vitality, helping your hair withstand the challenges posed by the monsoon weather. Remember, a healthy scalp is the foundation for healthy hair growth.",
