    "text": "Friday, July 19th 2024, 12:10 am Northern Oklahoma will continue to experience slightly drier air and a welcome break from the heat and humidity for the next several days. Additionally, another upper-level system is likely to develop near the southern plains by Sunday and may become cut-off from the flow for several days next week. This should bring additional showers and storm chances Sunday into early next week. There is a high probability that afternoon highs will stay below seasonal averages through the early part of next week. EMSA HEAT SAFETY TIPS: Northeast Oklahoma has various power companies and electric co-operatives, many with overlapping areas of coverage. Below is a link to various outage maps.
