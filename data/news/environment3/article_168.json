    "text": "Bengaluru: In a bid to improve its current 125th Swachh Sarvekshan rank among 446 cities, BBMP launched an initiative to tackle dust from ongoing infrastructure works and other construction activities and intensify its cleaning initiatives. BBMP’s comprehensive cleaning plan for the city’s pedestrian paths, narrow lanes, and sidewalks will ensure the city secures a better rank in this Swachh Survekshan. While mechanised garbage-sweeping machines currently clean the main roads, other roads are being maintained by sanitation workers.“BBMP has invited tenders for supply of electric walk-behind multifunctional sweepers-cum-litter pickers. These machines will sweep and wash footpaths, narrow lanes, and sidewalks. The selected bidders must supply the machines for one year and handle their operation and maintenance. BBMP will cover the cost of operation and labour,” said senior officials.BBMP is also focusing on high-density corridors for daily dust and waste collect. It has acquired 25 mechanised garbage sweeping machines on a contract basis and, each is expected to sweep and dispose of waste and dust on a 40-km stretch every night. It has also called tenders from organisations to supply compact-design machines to remove waste and dust from narrow roads and footpaths. The civic body is, however, aware of complaints that these machines are rarely seen at work. “We are looking at ensuring that the machine schedules are hosted online so that citizens could monitor them and file complaints, if any,” said a senior BBMP (SWM) official.
