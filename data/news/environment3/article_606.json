    "text": "According to media reports, the Lucid Air Pure is now the world's most energy-efficient EV.\nAs per reports, the EV brand has managed to improve the energy efficiency of its Air Pure EV to 5 miles per kWh, resulting in a 146 combined MPGe rating and an estimated range of 420 miles from its 84 kWh battery.\nLucid is said to have achieved this efficiency enhancement by making the EV's heat pump standard across all models - something which was earlier reserved only on the higher trims. The Lucid Air Pure is the EV's base model, sitting below the 'Air Touring' and 'Air Grand Touring' variants and is offered with a starting price of around $70,000.\nWith the enhancements, the Air Pure now offers a better range than the $79,000 mid-variant Air Touring option - which returns 406 miles. The top-spec Air Grand Touring variant offers 512 miles and is priced at around $110,000.\nThe Lucid Air Pure beat the Mercedes-Benz Vision EQXX, which previously held the title with an average of 8.3 miles per kWh. However, the Vision EQXX is a prototype and comes with a larger 100 kWh battery pack. The difference is of course that Lucid is a production EV with a smaller battery pack.\nSource: TheDrive",
