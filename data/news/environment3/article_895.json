    "text": "Clear Channel continues to champion the restoration of biodiversity in urban areas by launching the\nVertical Meadow. The green wall system is designed to integrate biodiversity into urban landscapes and underscores Clear Channel's commitment to enhancing the natural environment through innovative advertising solutions.\nThe UK is one of the most\nnature-depleted countries in the world, with nearly one in six species threatened with extinction. Insects crucial for pollination and ecosystem support, are disappearing at an alarming rate, with 41% of species facing extinction. Additionally, a newly released report by the British Trust for Ornithology reveals that 80% of butterfly species in the UK have declined since the 1970s, and half of our remaining butterfly species are at risk of extinction in Britain. Habitat loss, exacerbated by urban development, is a major factor in this decline as 97% of wildflower meadows are gone in the UK.\nClear Channel’s response to these challenges is The Vertical Meadow, whose revolutionary design means that plants are grown from a unique seeded mat without needing a mains water connection, in situ, rather than in a greenhouse. The seed mix, developed by The Wildlife Trusts and Buglife, features 25 types of native wildflowers and grasses, carefully selected to boost local biodiversity.\nThe\nWorld Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) reports that on a single summer day, one acre of wildflower meadow can host three million flowers, producing 1kg of nectar sugar - sufficient to support nearly 96,000 honeybees daily. This means the 9m2 Vertical Meadow system could contain over 6,500 flowers supporting over 200 bees per day in the height of summer.\nDue to this the Vertical Meadow is regarded as a valuable contributor to national programmes as they bolster wildlife corridors and bring natural beauty to urban environments with their changing seasonal colours. They can also help clean the air by trapping pollutants, reducing urban heat, mitigating rainwater runoff, and offering acoustic insulation when mounted to buildings. Furthermore, the lush greenery promotes mental and physical well-being, offering city dwellers a much-needed connection to nature.\nVertical Meadow joins Clear Channel's portfolio of green infrastructure solutions, including the highly successful\nLiving Roof, both crafted from sustainable and upcycled materials. Moreover, they’re the only products of their kind endorsed by the Wildlife Trusts for their substantial biodiversity benefits. Initiatives like these support the UK's Nature Recovery Networks, aligning with the UK Government's 2020 Environment Bill goals of enhancing biodiversity through urban greening.\nClear Channel’s launch of Vertical Meadows aligns with the\n2024 Big Butterfly Count, a nationwide citizen science project aimed at helping assess the health of our environment, which encourages members of the public to help scientists track the impacts of climate change on butterflies in monitoring butterfly populations – a key indicator for biodiversity levels.\nBy integrating Vertical Meadows into urban landscapes, Clear Channel is not only beautifying cities but also creating sustainable habitats that support a healthier environment. With 30 Vertical Meadows installed, nationwide, this innovative solution is a significant step forward in the effort to protect and enhance biodiversity in our urban areas.\nWill Ramage, managing director at Clear Channel, says, \"As a platform for good, we're dedicated to pioneering solutions that address the urgent biodiversity and ecological challenges our cities face. Following the success of our Living Roofs, the launch of Vertical Meadows marks another significant step in our mission to integrate nature into urban spaces. By creating vibrant, sustainable habitats that support local wildlife, we not only enhance the beauty of our urban environments but also contribute to the well-being of our communities. We believe innovative green infrastructure like Vertical Meadows is crucial for building a healthier, more resilient future for everyone.\"\nAlistair Law, founder of Vertical Meadow, says, “The goal of Vertical Meadow is to help tackle the biodiversity crisis in a cost-effective way by increasing the awareness of native wildflowers and their role in supporting nature recovery. We are very excited by the collaboration with Clear Channel as it helps move living walls from a luxury feature on high-end buildings to something that is accessible to everyone. This is very important if we want to truly address the nature crisis.”",
