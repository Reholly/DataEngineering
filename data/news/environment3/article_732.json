    "text": "Company Insolvency Statistics, June 2024\nMonthly company insolvency statistics for England and Wales, as well as Scotland and Northern Ireland.\nDocuments\nDetails\nMain messages for England and Wales\n-\nAfter seasonal adjustment, the number of registered company insolvencies in England and Wales in June 2024 was 2,361, 16% higher than in May 2024 (2,040) and 17% higher than the same month in the previous year (2,016 in June 2023). The number of company insolvencies remained much higher than those seen both during the COVID-19 pandemic and between 2014 and 2019.\n-\nCompany insolvencies in June 2024 consisted of 302 compulsory liquidations, 1,866 creditorsâ€™ voluntary liquidations (CVLs), 170 administrations and 23 company voluntary arrangements (CVAs). All types of company insolvency were higher than in both June 2023 and May 2024.\n-\nOne in 179 companies on the Companies House effective register (at a rate of 55.8 per 10,000 companies) entered insolvency between 1 July 2023 and 30 June 2024. This was an increase from the 55.1 per 10,000 companies that entered insolvency in the 12 months ending 30 June 2023. These 12-month rolling rates are calculated as a proportion of the total number of companies on the effective register to show longer term trends and reduce the volatility that would be associated with estimates based on single months.\n-\nWhile the insolvency rate has increased since the lows seen in 2020 and 2021, it remains much lower than the peak of 113.1 per 10,000 companies seen during the 2008-09 recession. This is because the number of companies on the effective register has more than doubled over this period.",
