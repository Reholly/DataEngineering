    "text": "( MENAFN - 3BL) Our people making a difference is a series featured throughout Owens Corning's 2023 Sustainability Report .\nWith approximately 30 years' experience at Owens Corning, SD Kim has an in-depth understanding of our operations in general and our Asan, South Korea, Roofing plant in particular. His expertise has been instrumental as we have sought to increase our positive impacts throughout the region, including our work to protect biodiversity around the plant. SD became especially interested in this topic after reviewing data provided by the Wildlife Habitat Council in 2022, and he has been actively involved in several projects that take concrete action toward our biodiversity aspirations.\nOn the importance of protecting biodiversity\nWhen the Earth's natural ecosystems maintain relationships with each other and achieve balance based on biodiversity, everything can flow more naturally. Protecting biodiversity is important globally as we work toward meeting the needs of today's generations while preserving our world for future generations.\nThis goes beyond environmental issues - it relates to social ethics and morality as well as the sustainability and self-preservation of humanity. Efforts that preserve biodiversity are essential for companies and are valuable in terms of conserving nature and ensuring coexistence between humans and the planet. Therefore, we believe that sustainable management is critical for all companies that develop resources and utilize them for business.\nOn the initiatives underway at the Asan plant\nI have shared the importance of protecting biodiversity with plant employees, and it has become part of our sustainability efforts. We have initiated several projects to protect birds, including the installation of film on office windows, which prevents collision. We also adjusted the angle of the streetlights so as not to obstruct the view of migrating birds.\nIn 2024, we will install birdhouses and noise reduction equipment. We are actively working on improving internal plant processes for reducing waste scrap and achieving zero waste-to-landfill using the Focused Improvement pillar of Total Productive Maintenance. In addition, we are installing solar panels on our roof in 2024, and we have targets to reduce energy intensity within the plant. Earth has a finite number of resources, and once they are gone, they cannot be used again. Therefore, we must take responsibility for sustainability and constantly think about it.\nOn tying biodiversity to the overall Owens Corning sustainability mission\nRecently, interest in the environment, ecosystems, and animal welfare appears to be increasing, and people recognize a need for consumption to be more sustainable and ethical. Improving the environment has now become a necessity rather than an option. I believe that sustainability is not only my responsibility, but also the responsibility of Owens Corning. As a company, we are making great efforts in manufacturing with the recycling of waste across all our businesses, as well as energy reduction, developing environment-friendly products, and supporting communities. I feel these are all definitely connected to protecting biodiversity around the world.\nMENAFN18072024007202015466ID1108457445",
