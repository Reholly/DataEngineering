    "text": "When Irish people consider renewable energy generation, we commonly think of wind turbines. However, it has been utility-scale solar power that has been making significant strides forward in recent years within the Irish electricity market. Solar has the potential to deliver a significant proportion of Ireland’s electricity requirements. Indeed, ESB’s current pipeline of solar projects has the capacity to generate more than a third of Ireland’s current 5.5GW peak demand for electricity with clean energy in the future. ESB’s solar development manager Eoin Naughton, who is working closely to deliver this pipeline, says: “People are forgiven for assuming Ireland may not be an ideal location for solar energy but it’s actually the hours and timing of the sunlight that matters most, and less so its strength”. Large sections of our island enjoy greater levels of solar resource than many parts of the UK. Also, advances in technology means we source solar PV panels designed for the mid-light levels typically experienced here in Ireland.” Energy sustainability Naughton has been interested in sustainability generally, and renewable energy, from a young age. “Growing up in Athlone I spent significant lengths of time on the inland waterways where I became intrigued by sustainability and the need for action to protect our natural environment”. That led to a passionate interest in energy sustainability. “I became particularly interested in the patriotic aspects of energy independence,” he says. “Ireland was importing up to 90 per cent of its energy. There is a clear geopolitical risk there which we are seeing today. Growing older I realised Ireland had the natural resources to address that risk and to stand on its own two feet in the energy space.” [Harnessing energy from the sun in Ireland makes more than just environmental sense](/sponsored/2024/07/19/harnessing-energy-from-the-sun-in-ireland-makes-more-than-just-environmental-sense/) [When it comes to sustainability, smart companies will not take the foot off the pedal](/sponsored/2024/07/05/when-it-comes-to-sustainability-smart-companies-will-not-take-the-foot-off-that-pedal/) [Why recognition of prior learning works for business](/sponsored/2024/06/11/why-recognition-of-prior-learning-works-for-business/) [Businesses need to transform their finance functions in order to compete and add strategic value](/sponsored/2024/06/28/businesses-need-to-transform-their-finance-functions-in-order-to-compete-and-add-strategic-value/) That led him to a career in renewable energy. “I invested my time in wind energy initially, spending six years developing wind projects in the UK and Ireland. In 2018, I took an opportunity to join ESB.” His initial role with the organisation was in the commercial area. “I led a team acquiring development-stage projects from developers,” he points out. “We built up a significant 2GW pipeline of solar projects. Now it’s about delivering that pipeline. This is something we have a history of doing well at ESB.” Naughton explains that the development assets acquired are sites with planning and other permissions in place to facilitate construction of solar farms. “Independent developers tend to do the early work of obtaining consents before selling the asset to an investor. ESB has been investing in these development assets. We now have a 2GW high quality pipeline – among the largest in the country.” The power of solar He has now moved into a new role as solar development manager. “A national utility like ESB, with its history, having responsibility for the largest pipeline of clean green solar projects is a real plus for Ireland. Multiple recent disruptions to global supply chains demonstrate the risk of relying on international markets so when we have natural resources available at home, we should do our best to maximise them”. Solar power has some particular characteristics that make it very important in the renewables mix, he continues. “The Irish electricity market is an unindustrialised grid network. Demand for power is much greater during the day than by night – unlike industrialised countries like the UK and Germany where demand is considered more stable.” “At times in Ireland, there is not enough renewable energy available during still summer periods when demand for electricity is high and then there can be a surplus of energy being produced at night during winter periods when the demand is low,” he adds. “The addition of new solar provides a harmonious correlation with the demand profile of the Irish energy system. It’s available from morning until evening when demand from our customers is at its highest and conveniently shuts down at night – so there is very little wastage.” That makes for a compelling investment opportunity. “For Irish consumers it’s relatively cheap to fund new solar farms because the annualised required supports are low. We are now seeing solar placing downward pressure on the wholesale cost of electricity. There is also an interesting just transition dimension here. “At a time when there is a lot of focus on emissions from the agriculture sector, solar is providing credible options for farmers exploring the opportunity of getting involved in producing decarbonised energy while earning additional income from their land,” Naughton points out. Bringing people on the journey ESB is investing €200 million in the first wave of solar projects. “We are on track to have a further five projects entering construction over the next 12 months,” he says. “The Middleton House solar farm just outside Lanesborough, Co Longford, is a very interesting example. ESB continues to build on our history of power generation in the area by utilising the existing grid connection infrastructure from the recently closed Lough Ree power station to connect a new solar farm in the area. The solar farm is connecting to the power station by using the old railway line that used to carry peat into the carbon intensive generating station. Now the solar farm will use this same rail pathway to transit new, renewable, electricity via cable on to the grid and into Irish homes and businesses in the area. Buy-in from people living in the vicinity of our projects is so important. New renewable energy projects can bring real benefits to local communities. For example, community benefit funds will be in place in places like Lanesborough. This recurring revenue goes to communities which adopt renewable projects each year. Local groups and organisations can access these funds to bring real and lasting benefits to their local area. We are doing our best to bring all of our stakeholders on the journey with us. Our relationships with our landowners, neighbouring residents and local community groups are really what will help us drive these projects and the wider work we are doing at ESB.” Looking ahead, Naughton adds ESB’s strategy is to deliver a net-zero future and solar will be a fundamental part of this. “Our electricity system is geared towards prioritising renewables,” he concludes. “This really is only the start for solar in Ireland and it is exciting to see where we go from here.” To read more about ESB’s renewable energy plans visit [esb.ie](http://www.esb.ie/)",
