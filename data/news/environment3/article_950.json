    "text": "\"Now that the area has been cleaned we are grateful. We will look after it and prevent illegal dumping.\"\nFed-up with rubbish strewn across their neighbourhood, Gugulethu residents rolled up their sleeves to clean illegal dumps on Thursday, Mandela Day.\nCommunity leader Sithembele Ntaba said people decided to clean up because they want to change the image of the township.\nThe clean-up campaign followed pleas to the City of Cape Town to assist the community with cleaning up.\nAfter the clean-up volunteers went door-to-door educating residents about illegal dumping and its consequences. They have vowed to police the area and hold dumpers accountable.\nGroundUp attended the clean-up campaign. The dump sites were filthy and smelly.\nResidents living close to the dumps complained that they cannot open their windows due to the stench. The mounds of rubbish are infested with flies and residents said their children are unable to play outside due to the filth on their doorsteps.\nVolunteers participating in the clean-up said the companies hired by the City of Cape Town were not doing enough, which is why community members decided to take matters into their own hands.\nSome said the companies contracted by the City of Cape Town stopped cleaning several months ago because syndicates were extorting money from them.\nThe City of Cape Town took part in the initiative and provided the residents with refuse bags.\nClose Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox\nTop Headlines South Africa Environment Submit By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy .\nSuccess!

He said he appreciated the community initiative.\nTwigg said illegal dumping was a problem not only in Gugulethu, but across Cape Town.\nNcumisa Sopangisa, principal of Intshinga Primary School in Gugulethu, said she was grateful the clean-up campaign had cleared a dumping site close to her school. Some of the school's learners took part in the cleanup.\n\"The illegal dumping site next to the school was an eyesore and a bad example for the children. The waste is a threat to their health. We will take it upon ourselves to educate the children that illegal dumping is a problem and should be stopped,\" said Sopangisa.\nResident Masithembe Mkosi said dumping had been ongoing for years. \"Now that the area has been cleaned we are grateful. We will look after it and prevent illegal dumping.\"\nRead the original article on GroundUp .",
