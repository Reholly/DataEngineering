    "text": "This is the trick that one needs to follow to beat the summer heat while saving some extra bucks on energy bills. Electricity bills can sometimes get outrageous and burn a hole in our wallets. Especially [during the summer](https://scoop.upworthy.com/summer-camp-staff-walks-out-after-their-offer-letter-terms-were-altered-without-notice), electricity bills soar higher than the temperature. So, Jackson L'Heureux–who goes by [@cheese_jackson45](https://www.tiktok.com/@cheese_jackson45/video/7257741595141786922) on TikTok–shared an effective hack to save some bucks on [ towering electric bills](https://scoop.upworthy.com/man-puts-his-foot-down-and-refuses-to-pay-after-being-forced-to-cover-restaurant-bill-for-strangers-644643-644643-644643-644643-644643). The smart approach he disclosed to his audience helped him gain over 182k views on one of his videos. \"With the summer heat at full blast, our bill nearly doubled, so it's time to make some changes,\" L'Heureux states in his [first video.](https://www.tiktok.com/@cheese_jackson45/video/7257741595141786922) \"The first thing I did was buy this watt meter to measure the wattages of all our appliances to see where I can make adjustments.\" He held up a white device with a small display, some buttons and a plug point and went on to explain how the device works. L'Heureux plugs in [various electrical appliances](https://scoop.upworthy.com/woman-discovers-shes-been-paying-utility-bills-for-her-entire-apartment-building-since-2021-671033-671033) in his house to check their energy consumption rate with the portable watt meter and he starts with his television. \"I started with our TV setup and found some interesting results,\" he states in the video. \"My 15-year-old TV consumes almost 140 watts, which is crazy. My PS4 consumes about 44 watts while doing light tasks. I also found that when in rest mode, the PS4 consumes about six watts, which is about the same as an LED light bulb.\" To lower the energy consumption of the TV, he adjusted the backlight setting. Following this adjustment, the [TV started](https://scoop.upworthy.com/man-turns-up-at-bbc-for-job-interview-ends-up-being-is-mistakenly-interviewed-on-live-tv-589037-589037-589037-589037-589037-589037-589037) consuming only 90 watts. L'Heureux also made sure to fully shut down his PS4 when he was not using it. [@cheese_jackson45]Follow for part 2! [#fyp] [#electricbill] [#reduce] [#savemoney] [#lifehacks] [#explore] [#trending] [#tiktok] [♬ Electric Avenue - Electric Avenue] In [part two](https://www.tiktok.com/@cheese_jackson45/video/7258034801913974059) of the video, he showed more ways to reduce electric bills. L'Heureux tackled the energy consumption issue of the lighting setups in his house. He starts the video by replacing the \"dumb\" LED bulb in a table lamp with a \"smart\" LED bulb, which even changes colors. \"It also consumes about seven watts and can be dimmed to bring that even lower,\" he explained. He then moved onto an LED light strip setup that illuminated the spaces under the cabinets in the kitchen. It can be dimmed down to bring the power consumption from 11 watts to 7.9. [The sunset lamp](https://scoop.upworthy.com/lamp-powered-by-seawater-that-can-shine-for-45-days-with-single-refill-is-helping-coastal-communities), which was placed on the top shelf, consumed 10 watts. \"Since it's USB, I can swap out the power brick and bring it down to 8 watts,\" L'Heureux noted. \"So in total, we went down from 21.6 watts to 15.2 watts,\" he concluded. The viewers on his TikTok page were thrilled to have this information and some even inquired about the watt meter.

Any ideas? It won't go lower.\" [@seanmcdonald73](https://www.tiktok.com/@cheese_jackson45/video/7258034801913974059) wondered, \"Wait, you bought new lights and then talked about how you can dim them? How is that saving anything?\" [@quizzy718](https://www.tiktok.com/@cheese_jackson45/video/7257741595141786922) shared, \"The biggest and easiest thing you can do is change all your lightbulbs to LEDs and put insulation film over your windows. Those alone will save you hundreds.\" [@walle242](https://www.tiktok.com/@cheese_jackson45/video/7257741595141786922) added, \"The best thing to do is just unplug anything you don't use in your home often.\" [@cheese_jackson45]Replying to @jacksonlheureux follow for part 3!
