    "text": "Published 8 hours ago\nSubmitted by Regency Centers\nA first of its kind for Regency Centers, a\nMicroHabitat Urban Farm activation and installation was recently unveiled at Mellody Farm in Vernon Hills, IL. This marks a unique company milestone as we set new industry standards while paving the way for a dynamic and impactful future.\nThe 30-pot farm will operate from June to October and is projected to yield 300 pounds of fresh vegetables, herbs, and edible flowers. Approximately 80% of the crops, harvested weekly, will be earmarked for donation to the\nVernon Township Food Pantry. The remaining produce will be divided among the center’s dining establishments and shared with the community during a neighborhood event for The Atworth at Mellody Farm.\nReinforcing our shopping centers as destinations of choice, Regency Centers is committed to modern, community-focused property development,” said\n[Peggy McDermott, Vice President, Property Operations]. “The Urban Farm exemplifies our commitment to sustainability and functionality, not only enhancing the property’s aesthetic appeal, but also providing a practical space for community engagement and environmental stewardship.\nThe MicroHabitat Urban Farm is more than a place to grow food — it’s designed to nurture community connections and foster educational opportunities. During monthly workshops, Mellody Farm shoppers can learn more about urban agriculture, its benefits for building a healthier society, and Regency’s mission to create greener communities.\nIn addition to offering fresh, chemical-free produce, the farm will also help reduce urban heat and improve air quality at Mellody Farm. This will help position the center for recognition with additional sustainability certifications and credits such as BOMA, WELL v2 points, and Fitwel.\nI’m thrilled to introduce the Urban Farm to Regency’s portfolio,” said Alisa Taggart, Property Marketing Manager. “This innovative addition will allow us to serve the local community in new and meaningful ways. We look forward to bringing intentional programming and unique experiences to those who work, live, and shop at Mellody Farm.\nKeenam Jax, a Goldador with a heart as big as his appetite, is the first local influencer to be involved in the new initiative at Mellody Farm, which is a pet-friendly shopping center. As an ambassador, Keenam shares his furry adventures on the farm via\nLocated in the heart of Chicagoland’s northern suburb of Vernon Hills,\nhttps://www.regencycenters.com/property/detail/60744/Mellody-Farm is an open-air, urban-inspired shopping and dining destination. The center provides 270,000 SF of retail space — including REI, Whole Foods Market, and Nordstrom Rack — plus 260 executive apartments, to the diverse population of Vernon Hills and the surrounding Lake County.\nFor leasing information, please contact or .\nView original content\nhere.\nAbout Regency Centers Corporation (NASDAQ: REG)\nRegency Centers is a preeminent national owner, operator, and developer of shopping centers located in suburban trade areas with compelling demographics.
