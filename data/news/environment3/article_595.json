    "text": "Due to the surge in retail prices of tomatoes across the country, the tomatoes produced in Himachal Pradesh's Solan are fetching good prices in the local markets. According to traders, while tomato prices have increased significantly, they have not reached the record highs witnessed last year. Traders say that the tomatoes produced in Solan are of superior quality and have been carefully graded, which ensures higher returns. Incessant rainfall across large parts of the country has affected the supply of tomatoes, with retail prices shooting over Rs 80 per kg in many big cities. The vendor said \"The highest price at which it was sold before this was 1600, and in the past two days, the tomato has been sold at 1200, 1250, and 1300 rupees. Last time, we got whatever rate we got, that rate can't come now, but it is so that the Bengaluru market is booming, which is why the market is booming here as well. But we can't say anything about the rate, Till now, this has been the maximum rate.\" \"} {\"@context\":\"https://schema.org",
