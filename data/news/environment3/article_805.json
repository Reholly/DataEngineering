    "text": "The new transport secretary, Louise Haigh, is being encouraged to take action to boost electric van uptake by implementing measures outlined in the\nZero Emission Van Plan.\nIn a letter to Haigh, the coalition behind the plan is calling for improved charging infrastructure with van needs in mind, removal of regulatory barriers that are preventing operators from making the switch and increased fiscal support to make new and used e-vans affordable.\nSignatories to the letter include Stellantis and the\nFleet News Fleet200 Strategy Network, which represents some of the largest fleet operators in the UK.\nHaving\n launched in the Houses of Parliament in February earlier this year, the Zero Emission Van Plan is the output of widespread collaboration between the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association (BVRLA), Logistics UK, Recharge UK, the Association of Fleet Professionals (AFP), and The EV Café.\nA spokesperson for the Zero Emission Van Plan, said: “Registrations for electric vans have stalled, from an already low starting point.\n“The ZEV mandate has been introduced to stimulate supply, but demand is lagging.\n“Van operators are struggling to make the transition work, facing barrier after barrier across vehicle quality, performance, cost, and charging infrastructure.\n“The Zero Emission Van Plan is clear. For the transition to work, we need increased fiscal support, improved charging and the removal of regulatory barriers.\n“We are calling on the new Government to take decisive action to make electric vans a realistic option for millions of drivers.”\nThe Zero Emission Van Plan coalition has also invited Haigh to visit a depot of an operator that has embraced electric vans, to enable the transport secretary to see the vehicles first hand and hear about the scale of the challenge to achieving widespread adoption.\nOne in ten workers - 3.4 million people - rely on a van for their jobs across a wide range of industries, from engineering and construction to emergency and rescue services.\nCommercial vehicles are the fastest-growing part of the vehicle parc. However, electric van registrations are faltering, with deliveries falling for a third month this year, down 16.8% on June last year,\naccording to the most recent figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).\nSome 1,476 fully electric vans were registered in the month, meaning battery electric vans accounted for just 4.7% of all new light van registrations compared with 5.2% for the same period last year.\nWith manufacturers mandated to ensure zero emission vehicles comprise a minimum of 10% of their new van registrations this year, market share heading in the opposite direction is a cause for concern.",
