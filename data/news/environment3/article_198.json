    "text": "When you think of Scotland, it’s hard not to picture fields of highland cattle, majestic horns... and bangs an angsty teenager would envy. Thousands of tourists travel to the country to see their [Weasley-esque](https://www.wizardingworld.com/fact-file/magical-miscellany/the-weasleys) auburn hair and experience the magic of the “hairy coos” in their element. We’re here to save you a plane ticket — or a [portkey](https://www.wizardingworld.com/fact-file/objects/portkey), for all you witches and wizards out there. In the foothills of Mount Hood, nestled in the lush forest of Brightwood, you’ll find [Highland Farms](https://www.highlandfarmsoregon.com/). This cedar mill turned farm stay has a [cottage](https://www.highlandfarmsoregon.com/cottage) and [lodge](https://www.highlandfarmsoregon.com/lodge), plus an [Airstream](https://www.highlandfarmsoregon.com/camp), that are ideal for a weekend retreat. The 6-acre property also serves as an event venue for enchanting [weddings](https://www.highlandfarmsoregon.com/wedding-venue), corporate retreats, and family gatherings. But we’re here to talk about the animals. The [tour](https://www.highlandfarmsoregon.com/tour-with-us) started with the stars of the show. Approaching the front paddock, we were greeted by certified highland cows and their Pyrenees guard dogs. Missy, who has one horn that points up and one that points down — they’re malleable when they’re young — eagerly stretched out her tongue for a treat. Isla, the cutest calf you’ll ever see, hovered just out of reach, unsure about it all. Our guide Jaya Graver was full of [facts](https://www.visitinvernesslochness.com/itinerary/where-to-find-highland-cows) about the oldest registered breed of cattle in the world. They were raised for beef in the Outer Hebrides as early as the sixth century. Legend says when Queen Victoria visited the Scottish Highlands, she made her preference for the reddish variety known, and selective breeding has since made [black (and other colors)](https://www.highlandcattlesociety.com/breed-standards) less common. The ranch was home to plenty of supporting characters too. We fed hay to endangered [San Clemente Island goats](https://livestockconservancy.org/heritage-breeds/heritage-breeds-list/san-clemente-island-goat/) and were gently ram-inded to keep scratching the Icelandic sheep behind the ears. The resident albino peacock even fanned his feathers for us. All in all, you could say it was a moo-ving experience.",
