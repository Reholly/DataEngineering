    "text": "By Katie Parkins ,\n4 hours ago The City of Louisville unveiled its first fleet of fully electric trash and recycling trucks Wednesday, saying the city was the first in the country to do so .\n\"To be the first municipality in the country to adopt an electrified fleet showcases their desire to find tangible solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change,\" Richard Coupland, Republic Services vice president of municipal services, said.\nLouisville will completely replace its current fleet of trash and recycling trucks by the end of the year. This will contribute to the city's Sustainability Action Plan goals and Republic Services' goal to operate more than 50 EVs across the country by the end of 2024.\nThe four new trucks in Louisville are McNeilus Volterra electric vehicles that produce zero tailpipe emissions, according to Republic Services. They have audible devices to alert other drivers and pedestrians of their presence to counteract how much quieter EVs generally are compared to traditional trash trucks.\nThe EVs will also have automated braking systems and sensors if drivers drift out of the lane lines, Republic Services said.\nOne of the chief concerns with any electric vehicle is the distance it can travel before it needs to be charged again.\nRepublic Services responded to that by saying:\n\"Collection trucks drive short distances, travel at slow speeds and make many stops and starts during a route, all of which are factors that make our fleet ideal for electrification. Plus, all trucks return to a base overnight where they can be recharged.\"\nRepublic Services \"The technology already has been proven in other cities with more challenging climates than ours,\" Louisville Mayor Chris Leh said . \"What's more, it is cost-competitive for our taxpayers.\"\nThis is part of a trend nationwide to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and make electric vehicles more widely used.\nEnvironment\nEPA offers grants to swap heavy-duty vehicles for zero-emission versions Danielle Kreutter 8:20 PM, May 09, 2024 Around $932 million in grants are available for communities to swap out heavy-duty vehicles, like trucks and school buses, for electric versions.\nIt can be costly to buy electric vehicles for these purposes. The EPA is accepting applications for grants to help cover such costs, including related infrastructure costs through July 25.\nDenver 7+ Colorado News Latest Headlines | July 18, 8am",
