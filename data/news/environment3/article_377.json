Updated: 11:22 PM EDT Jul 18, 2024 Madison Elliott Reporter Seventeen acres along South 11th Street, formerly the site of the Rhodia Chemical Plant, is getting cleaned up so it can be redeveloped. On Thursday, the Metro Budget Committee discussed the next steps in funding for the West Louisville Project. In 2022, Metro Council approved $10 million in American Rescue Plan funds to pay for digging up and getting rid of dangerous materials. On Thursday, the Director of the Louisville Accelerator Team Ken Hillebrand said $1.3 million in ARP funds is left. An amendment to the ordinance was proposed to allow for unused funds to be used for infrastructure for the redevelopment of the site. Ultimately, the committee approved the amendment and the change will head to the full Metro Council. The property, which straddles the line between the Park Hill and the Algonquin neighborhoods, has sat vacant for 30 years. Rhodia and other companies manufactured or used chemicals on the property for almost 80 years until the mid-1990s, according to the city. The city later bought the land. In 2020, the city selected the Re:Land Group to redevelop the site. Last October, work began to clean up the land. Co-founder of Re:Land, Jim Beckett, says 6.5 of the 17 acres have already been remediated.He says city contractors are in conversation with the state Environmental Protection Agency to get final approval for the first phase of this project, which includes 233 units of solar net-zero affordable housing. He says in addition to the state EPA, they must satisfy all of the State Kentucky Housing Corporation’s requirements for financing and construction, along with other approvals at both the state and city levels.Beckett says the project is focused on the community and creating a place where people can meet and exceed their fullest potential. \"These neighborhoods deserve everything- period,\" he said. Re:Land established an advisory board made up of residents and key stakeholders. Bruce Sherrod is a part of that group. He says community is key. \"It's very instrumental, very important,\" Sherrod said. \"So actually, we are looking to get at least 100 folks from the Park Hill neighborhood to be engaged with what we are doing.\"Beckett is hopeful they may be able to break ground before the end of the year.
