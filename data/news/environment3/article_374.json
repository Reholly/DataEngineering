    "text": "The Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) organised a two-day training programme on the “Use of ornamental plants for landscaping”, to keep the city dwellers and villagers aligned with the latest trends of landscaping.

The programme coordinator Prerna Kapila said that the training programme was planned keeping in the mind the rising preference for the use of ornamental plants for landscaping at the rooftop of the houses, farms or other surrounding areas. The resource persons Parminder Singh, head, department of floriculture and landscaping; KK Dhatt, Rishu Sharma, Ranjit Singh, Tanya Thakur, Simrat Singh, Madhu Bala and Aman Sharma whetted the skills of the trainees on different aspects of landscaping.
