    "text": "New Delhi: South Eastern Coalfields Limited’s (SECL) Gevra and Kusmunda coal mines, located in Chhattisgarh’s Korba district, have been ranked as the second and fourth largest coal mines in the world, respectively, according to the latest rankings by WorldAtlas.com. These two mines collectively contribute more than 100 million tons to India's annual coal production, which represents about 10% of the country's total output.The Gevra opencast mine, operational since 1981, boasts a production capacity of 70 million tons annually, with 59 million tons produced in FY 23-24. It is projected to continue meeting significant energy demands in India for the next decade with its extensive coal reserves.Adjacent to Gevra, the Kusmunda OC mine has also made headlines by producing over 50 million tons of coal in FY 23-24, making it the second mine in India to reach this production level after Gevra.Both mines are equipped with advanced mining technology. The use of “Surface Miner” machines allows coal extraction without the need for blasting, aligning with eco-friendly mining practices. Additionally, for overburden removal, which involves clearing soil and rock to access coal seams, the mines employ some of the largest heavy earth moving machinery (HEMMs) in the world, including 240-ton dumpers and 42 cubic meter shovels, supported by Vertical Rippers for a blast-free process.SECL’s CMD, Dr. Prem Sagar Mishra, said, \\\"It is indeed a proud moment for Chhattisgarh state that two of the World’s five largest coal mines are now in the state.\\\" He extended his thanks to the Coal Ministry, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), the State Government, Coal India, the Railways, and other stakeholders. Special recognition was given to the workforce, whom Mishra referred to as 'coal warriors', for their dedication and hard work in achieving this feat.",
