    "text": "Indore Breaks World Record with Massive Tree Plantation Drive Indore Mayor Pushyamitra Bhargava announced that the city has set a new Guinness World Record by planting over 11 lakh saplings in a single day, surpassing Assam's previous record. The effort was a collaboration between the public, the Border Security Force, and various social groups. The week-long initiative saw the total plantation of 51 lakh saplings. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Indore | Updated: 19-07-2024 13:29 IST | Created: 19-07-2024 13:29 IST - Country: - India Indore Mayor Pushyamitra Bhargava on Friday declared that the city has made history by planting over 11 lakh saplings in a single day, setting a new Guinness World Record. The achievement was possible through public participation and significant contributions from the Border Security Force (BSF). On July 14, Indore met its ambitious goal, previously held by Assam, of planting the most trees in 24 hours. Mayor Bhargava revealed that the idea was initiated by Urban Development Minister Kailash Vijayvargiya, and it was decided that breaking the record would be more feasible if the plantation activities spanned over a week. Revati Hill was chosen as the site for this massive plantation drive, with zones meticulously divided and thousands of volunteers mobilized. Of the 11 lakh saplings, the BSF planted 3 lakh, with forest and civic body teams planting another 1 lakh, and social groups contributing 7 lakh saplings. The drive resulted in a total of 51 lakh saplings planted in a week. Union Home Minister Amit Shah lauded Indore for this monumental achievement and participated in the 'Ek Ped Maa Ke Naam' campaign by planting a sapling in the city on the record day. According to the Guinness World Records website, the previous benchmark was set by Assam with 9,21,730 saplings. (With inputs from agencies.)
