    "text": "Ludhiana: Gearing up for making Ludhiana a ‘paddy stubble-free burning’ district, the district administration, along with agriculture and farmers welfare department, has embarked on a \\\"special campaign\\\" to distribute subsidised paddy straw management equipment to farmers in the coming weeks. Presiding over a meeting, deputy commissioner Sakshi Sawhney said that burning of paddy stubble is hazardous for the farmers and land, which is considered mother by farmers. She unequivocally pointed out that burning of paddy straw is hardly a solution for the farm residue management as it “ruins the health of soil besides causing huge loss to the environment”. Sawhney mentioned that due to the burning of paddy stubble, several major nutrients and other micronutrients of soil get destroyed. She also said that instead of burning the paddy stubble, the farmers must adopt effective methods for in-situ management through the latest techniques. She claimed that to encourage the farmers for this, the administration and department had decided to give several machines — including happy seeder, super seeder, smart seeder, rake, mulcher, paddy chopper shredder, RMB plough and others — to farmers and farmers’ group on subsidy, adding that the individual farmer was entitled to get 50% subsidy while farmers group/cooperative societies could get 80% subsidy.The deputy commissioner also directed the officials to prepare a roadmap to cover each village in its awareness drive during this year. An official statement said that last year, the district recorded 32% less cases of stubble burning and now this time, “we have to work harder to ensure none of the farmers indulge in the unhealthy practice”.Prominent amongst those present on the occasion included ADCs Anmol Singh Dhaliwal, Rupinder Pal Singh, SDMs and others.We also published the following articles recentlyLudhiana district administration \\\"gears\\\" up for making Ludhiana stubble burning free districtDiscover how Ludhiana is taking steps to become a paddy stubble free burning district.
