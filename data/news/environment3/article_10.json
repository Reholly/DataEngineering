    "text": "WASHINGTON— This week, U.S. Representative Kelly Armstrong (ND-AL) joined Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Senator Michael Bennet (D-CO), and Representative Brittany Pettersen (CO-07) and penned a bipartisan, bicameral letter to the leaders of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees over concerns with the federal financing of our nation's water infrastructure.\nThe Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) and the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) have been the principal financing programs for drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater projects for nearly three decades. Since the 2021, more than $3.7 billion dollars has been redirected from CWSRF and DWSRF to fund the Community Project Funding/Congressionally Directed Spending (CPF/CDS) process. While CPF/CDS projects are critical investments to support local water infrastructure needs, redirecting money away from the State Revolving Funds means that states will experience significant shortfalls in funding important water infrastructure projects.\nIn the letter, the Members urge Appropriators to provide a more sustainable funding source for critical water projects, particularly one that does not siphon off funds from essential projects that rely on SRF financing.\n“The Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds have been critical to expand access to clean water, modernize aging water infrastructure, and safeguard our public health,” wrote the Members. “If funding shortfalls and diversions continue, a major lifeline of our federal water infrastructure funding will run dry at a time when costs for infrastructure, design, and planning are skyrocketing.”\nPettersen led this charge after hearing from water experts across Colorado and the 7th Congressional District – including members of her Water Advisory Council – about the devastating impact these funding shortfalls could have on Colorado water infrastructure.\n“Robust funding through the annual appropriations bills are essential for SRF borrowers to maintain their access to financing for critical infrastructure and ensure clean water for years to come.” said Keith McLaughlin, Executive Director of the Colorado Water Resources and Power Development Authority.\n“The Colorado Water Congress has long supported legislation and appropriations processes to fund our nation’s clean water and drinking water infrastructure,” said Chane Polo, Deputy Director of the Colorado Water Congress. “It is our policy to support efforts that maximize the ability of water funding entities, including the Colorado Water Resources and Power Development Authority, to finance water projects. SRFs provide more communities with access to affordable financing for water infrastructure that protects public health needs.”\n“The changes to the amounts of revolving fund financing available to states have had a direct impact on Cañon City,” said Leo Evans, Canon City Water Public Works Director . “When we first started working with the state, we were in line for $5M in principal forgiveness through the program paired with a $5M low-interest loan. We went to work and based the next three years of capital planning and budgeting on those figures. When we reached the next stage of the application process, we were informed that the principal forgiveness amounts available to us had been reduced to a maximum of $1M. That change has thrown a lot of our capital planning up in the air and left the city with uncertainty on how best to proceed with our planned improvements. Restoring the program funding back to the original levels envisioned in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law would help Cañon City ensure that we can bring the benefits of this program to our community.”\nThe letter has been endorsed by the Colorado Water Congress, Colorado Rural Water, Colorado Water Utility Council (CWUC), Metro Water Recovery, National Governors Association (NGA), American Water Works Association (AWWA), Council of Infrastructure Financing Authorities (CIFA), National Association of Counties (NACo), National Special Districts Coalition (NSDC), Association of State Drinking Water Administrators (ASDWA), Association of Clean Water Administrators (ACWA), Clean Water Action, Water Environment Federation, Texas Water Conservation Association, Water & Wastewater Equipment Manufacturers Association, Western States Water Council, American Rivers, National Water Resources Association, Alliance for Water Efficiency, River Network, National Municipal Stormwater Alliance, National Association of Clean Water Agencies (NACWA), Association of Clean Water Administrators, Green Infrastructure Leadership Exchange, American Public Works Association, Texas Water Infrastructure Network, Water Environment Association of Texas (WEAT), Texas American Water Works Association, Texas Water Foundation, Association of Water Board Directors-Texas, Freshwater Future, Environmental Policy Innovation Center (EPIC), Clean Water Construction Coalition, Western Recycled Water Coalition, Natural Resources Defense Council, Distribution Contractors Association, Pennsylvania Utility Contractors Association, Minnesota Utility Contractors Association.\nThe full text of the letter can be found HERE and below\nDear Chair Murray, Vice Chair Collins, Chair Cole, Ranking Member DeLauro, Chair Merkley, Ranking Member Murkowski, Chair Simpson, and Ranking Member Pingree:\nWe write concerning current state allocations for the Clean Water and the Drinking Water State Revolving Funds (SRF), which were reduced as a result of redirecting funds to the Community Project Funding and Congressionally Directed Spending (CPF/CDS) process. The CPF/CDS process is part of federal aging water infrastructure financing programs; however, if broader SRF resources continue to be diverted to CPF/CDS, states will experience significant shortfalls in funding water infrastructure projects.\nAs you develop the Fiscal Year 2025 (FY25) Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill, we urge the Committee to take two steps. First, increase funding for SRFs to account for CPF/CDS. Second, provide a more sustainable funding source for critical water projects through the CPF/CDS process, particularly one that does not siphon funds from essential projects reliant on SRF financing.\nThe SRFs have been the principal water financing programs for more than three decades, supporting water infrastructure projects – such as drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater projects – through low-cost loans and limited grants to underserved communities to cities and towns across our nation. These funds have been critical to expand access to clean water, modernize aging water infrastructure, and safeguard our public health. After Congress resumed the CPF/CDS process in the 117th Congress, annual Appropriations Acts reduced funding for state SRFs by more than $3.7 billion in FY22, FY23, and FY24 to fund CPF/CDS.\nIn FY22 and FY23, 56% of funds for both SRFs in aggregate were diverted to CPF/CDS (not including supplemental appropriations in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL)); meaning that during this time, only 44% of SRF funds supported low-cost loans and limited grants for water infrastructure projects. In FY24, Congress provided a total of $2,764,962,000 for the SRFs. Of this amount, 51.3% or $1,419,312,172 was dedicated to CPF/CDS. If funding shortfalls and diversions continue, a major lifeline of our federal water infrastructure funding will run dry at a time when costs for infrastructure, design, and planning are skyrocketing.\nCongress made a concerted effort to invest in our aging water infrastructure through the BIL. The law seeded $43 billion for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund and the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, funding a critical boost for dire repairs. However significant, this historic one-time infusion will eventually run out. SRFs pay dividends for our water infrastructure and are necessary to further BIL investments. For these reasons, we urge the Committee to invest in sustainable funding sources for SRFs.\nWe are grateful for the Committee's commitment to fund our nation's clean water and drinking water infrastructure through the annual Appropriations process, but we are increasingly concerned about SRFs’ solvency in years to come. Through the FY25 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill, we urge the Committee to ensure the longevity of SRFs by fully funding the programs and to provide a more sustainable funding source for CPF/CDS.\nThank you for your consideration of this request.\nSincerely,",
