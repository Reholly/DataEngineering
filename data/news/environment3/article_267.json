    "text": "The Princess of Wales has hailed the “power of nature” in helping “wellbeing” following her cancer diagnosis. Kate Middleton, 42, opened up about her belief in the soothing qualities of the outdoors as she starts to make a return to the spotlight since revealing she was undergoing preventative cancer treatment. The mother-of-three said in a series of Instagram posts on Thursday to mark the opening of new gardens at the Natural History Museum, London: “I am hugely supportive of the Museum’s commitment to create a special space which encourages people of all ages to reconnect with nature and learn more about how we can protect our natural world. “I know the power of nature to support our development and well-being, both by bringing us joy and helping to keep us physically, mentally and spiritually healthy. “I hope these gardens will be inspiring and transformative for the thousands of people who visit.” Princess Kate has taken to Instagram after opening a new garden at the Natural History Museum.

She made her second public appearance of the year on Sunday when she attended Wimbledon to watch the Grand Slam final from the Royal Box. The future Queen was joined by her nine-year-old daughter Princess Charlotte and sister Pippa Middleton, 40, and was greeted with a standing ovation as she headed into the box. Natural History Museum bosses on Thursday opened a free-to-visit outdoor gallery and “living laboratory” to support nature recovery in the face of climate change. Five acres around the building have been transformed into two gardens, named the Nature Discovery Garden and the Evolution Garden. Kate’s first public appearance after revealing her health fight was at the Trooping the Colour in June. She announced in March she has being undergoing preventative cancer treatment, following major abdominal surgery that left her hospitalised at the start of the year.",
