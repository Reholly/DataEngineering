    "text": "‘Something is being done’: City receives extra $1M as they work to cleanup the old Loris High School property LORIS, S.C. (WMBF) - The City of Loris is joining forces with the state, as they work to transform a long-standing eyesore, the old Loris High School property. In June leaders received approval for an additional $1 million from state legislators. This comes after Loris received $1 million [earlier this year, to help purchase the property](https://www.wmbfnews.com/2024/01/16/loris-receives-1m-state-help-purchase-old-loris-high-school-property/). The school was built in 1930 and closed in 1988 when the new Loris High School was completed. The school then reopened when a primary school was being constructed, but closed for good in 1996. “It’s heartbreaking. It’s just a shame,” said a neighbor to old school grounds, Betty Carter. On Thursday, Carter reflected on the site she’s watched decay, just yards from her home. “What can you do when it’s gone so far,” said Carter. Carter said it’s difficult to look at the abandoned site each day because, for her, it’s personal. “I went to high school right over there. Graduated there in 1960. My husband graduated in 61 from there,” said Carter. Inside the rundown buildings, halls that once held students full of life, now sit filled with moldy books and broken glass. Carter said over the years, the school has also attracted a slew of folks up to no good. “Since nobody was using it, people just started breaking in,” said Carter. However, this situation could all soon be changing. Along with the city’s $1 million funding, they also received a grant application from the former Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC). The application will allow DHEC to asses the old grounds for contaminants. The city said the assessment could take several months to complete. After DHEC assesses the property, the city said folks will then start to see real change in the area. “Within the next six months to a year, you could actually see some of the buildings being taken down, some of the site being cleaned up,” said City of Loris City Administrator, William Young. While those with ties to the school reflect, many are also looking forward to the next chapter for the grounds. “I’m glad something is being done. I’d rather it be a park or something like that,” said Carter. The city has been approved for their funds, but they will get the $1 million in their pocket by the fall.
