    "text": "A rare tree kangaroo has finally made its celebrity appearance!\nA little joey was born at the end of December at the Bronx Zoo , but has been in the pouch period until now. This week, weâ€™re finally getting our first glimpse of it, and while any newborn animal would be a cause for celebration, this is an extra special event because it is only the second of its species to be born at the Bronx Zoo and to this particular female kangaroo since 2021.\nRECOMMENDED: NYC adopt-a-dog day is your sign to take a furry friend home - for free\nThe baby is a wee Matschie Tree kangaroo, which the International Union for Conservation of Nature sadly labeled as Endangered back in 1996. It is thought that less than 2,500 remain in the wild. Tree kangaroos typically live in lowland and mountainous rainforests in Papua New Guinea among other places, and thus have adapted to a high altitude lifestyle in the trees, according to the Wildlife Conservation Society. Because of this rainforest habitation, the tree kangaroos are threatened by habitat destruction, along with unsustainable hunting practices and other human activities.\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Bronx Zoo (@bronxzoo)",
