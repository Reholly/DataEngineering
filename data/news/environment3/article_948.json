    "text": "A new study finds that planted mangroves can store up to 73 percent of the carbon that naturally occurring mangroves hold, based on 40 years of data. [Alexa Robles-Gil reports for Inside Climate News.](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/16072024/planted-mangroves-carbon-storing-study/) In short: - Planted mangroves, in 20 years, can accumulate about 73 percent of the carbon stocks of natural mangroves. - The study analyzed 684 sites globally, offering a comprehensive look at the carbon storage potential of restored mangroves. - Mangrove restoration is essential but must be done correctly to be effective in carbon sequestration. Key quote: “If it’s successful, then yes, you can get 75 percent of the carbon stocks of a natural forest. If you do it unsuccessfully, you get zero.” — Daniel Friess, coastal scientist at Tulane University Why this matters: Planted mangroves could be a vital tool in combating climate change by storing significant amounts of carbon. However, [restoration projects must be carefully managed to achieve their potential benefits](https://www.ehn.org/international-carbon-credits-lead-to-mangrove-restoration-in-senegal-but-raise-social-equity-concerns-2668763868.html). insideclimatenews.org",
