    "text": "A new partnership between FIU and the New York Botanical Garden (NYBG) is helping to train more professionals to tackle threats to tropical plants. A $500,000 gift from an anonymous donor will support fellowships for Ph.D. students at FIU including training and mentorship opportunities at both FIU's International Center for Tropical Botany (ICTB) at the Kampong in Coconut Grove and the NYBG. Plant species and ecosystems are suffering from climate change, land-use changes and overharvesting. Knowledge gaps exist, with many species yet to be discovered. It remains unknown how many of these plants can be used as medicines, materials and foods. \"At a time when expertise in biodiversity science is most needed, we are not training enough new scientists,\" said Christopher Baraloto, director of the ICTB. \"This novel partnership to train graduate students in tropical plant sciences represents a significant initiative.\" In addition, ICTB's educational programs and outreach initiatives are aligned with the NYBG. Together, both programs could increase impact and outreach. As a global leader in plant research, NYBG conducts field and laboratory research while also enacting conservation initiatives and advocating for biodiversity. \"Botanic gardens are an untapped resource for investigating functional ecology, and with the outstanding laboratory facilities and collections we have at NYBG, this is a promising new fellowship opportunity,\" said Mauricio Diazgranados, NYBG's chief science officer and dean of science. ICTB is headquartered at the Kampong, the historic home of famed plant explorer David Fairchild in Coconut Grove and one of five gardens operated by the National Tropical Botanical Garden. ICTB is a hub for tropical plant research as a state-of-the-art science and education facility. Both institutions will recruit students from around the world to become global leaders in tropical botanical research. With these fellowships, FIU is hoping to build a future network of trained professionals who are committed to saving plants and uncovering new ways they can be used to improve our lives.
