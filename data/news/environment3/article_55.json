    "text": "By Jack Aylmer ,\n2 hours ago\nEmployees at a Red Lobster restaurant in Pueblo, Colorado, made a rare find after an orange lobster was accidentally delivered to the restaurant. The restaurant's manager and customers noticed how much the lobster stuck out among the other darker colored crustaceans in the restaurant's tank and made sure it did not become a customer's meal.\nThe restaurant ultimately called Denver's Downtown Aquarium , and aquarium staff transported the lobster to Denver on Wednesday, July 17. Aquarium officials said that they named the lobster \"Crush\" in honor of the Denver Broncos' famous \"Orange Crush\" defense that dominated in the 1970s and 1980s.\nThe food vendor who delivered Crush to the Pueblo Red Lobster said that the lobster was captured off of the coast of Canada.\nAquarium officials said that Crush's color comes from \"a genetic mutation, which affects encoded proteins. The lack of one or several proteins can reveal itself in colors, including blue, yellow and orange.\"\nThe genetic mutation is extremely rare, occurring in just one in every 30 million lobsters, according to the Downtown Aquarium .\nHowever, this is not the first time an orange lobster nearly ended up on someone's seafood platter. In 2018, a Massachusetts grocery store discovered it had an orange lobster in its tank. The store also sent that lobster to a local aquarium.\nThe post 1-in-30-million orange lobster found at Red Lobster in Colorado appeared first on Straight Arrow News .\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
