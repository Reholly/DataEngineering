    "text": "Leading sustainable packaging provider, DS Smith, has reduced GHG emissions by 19% compared to 2019/20, replaced more than one billion pieces of plastic ahead of schedule, and achieved an ‘A’ rating on climate change from the global environmental non-profit, CDP.\nThe progress is detailed in DS Smith’s latest Sustainability Report, which sets out the business’ commitments across key focus areas of Circularity, Carbon, Nature and People & Communities.\nExceeding its target to replace over one billion pieces of plastic across DS Smith’s international markets and doing so more than a year ahead of schedule, is a key highlight from the report. Guided by its Now & Next Sustainability Strategy, meeting the milestone supports DS Smith’s Circularity objectives of designing out waste and keeping materials in use for longer.\nThe Now & Next Sustainability Strategy was refreshed last year to help the business prioritise circularity, accelerate the journey to Net Zero, and strengthen the business’ focus on people & communities, and nature. Propelled by the Now & Next Strategy, DS Smith seeks to lead the transition to a low carbon, circular economy in support of its Purpose to Redefine Packaging for a Changing World.\nOther highlights from DS Smith’s new sustainability report are:\nESG Ratings:\nRecognised for its leadership in corporate transparency and performance on climate change by global environmental non-profit CDP, securing a place on its annual ‘A List.’ Carbon:\nReduced total Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions by 5% compared to last year and -19% compared to 2019/20 Invested €90m to install a new biomass boiler at their Rouen paper mill which is set to save 99,000 tonnes of CO2 a year. People and Communities:\nEngaged 9.8 million people on the Circular economy and circular lifestyles Reduced the number of accidents by 12% year-on-year. Nature:\nAll our fourteen paper mills completed biodiversity activities. Circularity:\nReduced the amount of waste sent to landfill by 19% compared to last year 90% of new packaging specifications optimised for individual customer supply chains A commitment to Circularity has been fundamental to the business’ progress on Sustainability, supported by its partnership with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. DS Smith’s 800 designers have been trained in Circular Design Principles and Circular Design Metrics created in partnership with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.\nThese help to assess performance against areas such as recycled content and recyclability, indicative estimated CO2 emissions, levels of excess waste and supply chain parameters in partnership with customers. Since their launch, over 100,000 packaging design decisions have been influenced by the company’s Circular Design Metrics.\nMiles Roberts, Group Chief Executive of DS Smith, commented:\n“I am delighted with the progress we have made on our Now & Next Sustainability Strategy as detailed in our latest Sustainability Report. I am immensely proud of our team for exceeding our plastic replacement target more than a year early, continuing to reduce our greenhouse gas emission year-on-year, and securing recognition as a sustainability leader by CDP.\n“We believe that our Now & Next Sustainability Strategy is leading our industry, so while it is right to celebrate our colleagues’ achievements, we also know we need to keep moving forward and are working with our customers to ensure that together we can lead the transition to a low carbon, circular economy.”",
