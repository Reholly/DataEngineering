In a video seen on Instagram, the brand's Vinoperfect serum is seen cruising down the river. The serum drips down the edge of the dropper and instantly changes the colour of the river from a dirty green to a shade of blue. As the serum clears the river, green balloons appear out of the water too.

MARKETING-INTERACTIVE has reached out to Caudalie for more information. The social post comes as Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo and other French officials swam in the River Seine this week to prove that the river is clean enough to host swimming competitions in the upcoming Olympics. According to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tylerroush/2024/07/17/paris-mayor-swims-in-seine-amid-pollution-concerns-heres-why-olympic-events-could-be-canceled/), the company responsible for the city's water supply and other organisations have warned that the river has unsafe pollution levels. Last month, the river had [reportedly](https://www.france24.com/en/france/20240628-one-month-from-the-paris-olympics-tests-reveal-the-river-seine-is-still-unfit-for-swimming) tested for unsafe levels of E. coli pollution - an indicator of faecal matter - at four different sections of the river for the third consecutive week. The levels were also far above the upper limits imposed by sports federation. Just a month ago, the River Seine also made the news when some French citizens threatened to defecate in the river on June 23 to mock the fact that Hidalgo and other French officials were planning to swim in it. It is unclear if this was actually carried out ahead of the swim. French authorities have reportedly spent €1.4 billion in the last decade attempting to clean up the river by improving the Paris sewage system, as well as building new water treatment and storage facilities. However, it was reported that months of unusually wet weather had made the flow of the river four to five times higher than its usual level in the summer months. That said, organisers have reportedly insisted that some dry weather and sunshine in July should be sufficient to make the Seine fit for the outdoor swimming events.
