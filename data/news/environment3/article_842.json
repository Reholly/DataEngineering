    "text": "Trumpeter swans are majestic creatures, admired for their graceful presence and impressive size. They hold the distinction of being the largest species of aquatic bird globally and are the heaviest bird native to North America. Trumpeter swans are not only an awe-inspiring sight, but also a symbol of the wild beauty and biodiversity of the continent. Therefore, ensuring that their journey of recovery continues without depletion is crucial to preserving this iconic species.\nBy the late 19th century, trumpeter swans had vanished from Eastern Canada due to relentless hunting and habitat loss. Their disappearance marked a sombre chapter in the region’s natural history. However, in the mid-1980s, a dedicated conservation effort brought these magnificent birds back to Ontario, where they have since flourished. No longer listed as endangered, trumpeter swans are now protected under the federal Migratory Birds Convention Act.\n×\nAlready a Subscriber?

Their presence signifies a thriving, diverse environment, and Royal Botanical Gardens (RBG) is proud that its conservation efforts have led to such a habitat, resulting in trumpeter swans nesting on its property.\nHowever, despite their success in population growth, individual trumpeter swans still face threats, many of which are human-induced. RBG pleads with its visitors to help safeguard these birds, asking them to avoid three critical behaviours:\nFirst, people should not approach nests or young swans. When in natural areas, it’s essential for visitors to keep their dogs on leash and remain on designated trails to minimize disturbances. This year, a pair of trumpeter swans nested on the lower Grindstone Creek in Royal Botanical Gardens’ Hendrie Park. Unfortunately, thoughtless trail users have harassed these birds, leading to the loss of a baby swan. Second, people should not feed trumpeter swans. Many well-meaning individuals offer food, such as bread, to wildlife, but this can cause severe nutritional problems. For trumpeter swans, excessive carbohydrate intake can lead to a condition called “angel wing,” a permanent disability that impairs their ability to fly. It’s crucial to let these birds forage naturally to maintain their health. Both RBG and the City of Burlington have a strict policy prohibiting the feeding of wildlife, with enforcement regulated by the City of Burlington’s bylaw enforcement department. If you witness wildlife feeding, please report it to Burlington’s bylaw enforcement. Third, people fishing should be mindful of their location, as it poses significant risks to nearby trumpeter swans. Barbed hooks can be fatal if ingested, and lead fishing weights are toxic. Additionally, discarded fishing line can entangle or be ingested by wildlife, potentially causing injury or death. It is recommended to use less-harmful alternatives, such as lead-free weights and barbless hooks. By respecting these guidelines and supporting conservation efforts, visitors can contribute to creating a safe and nurturing environment for trumpeter swans and other wildlife within our community. Together, we can ensure these majestic birds continue to thrive for generations to come.\nDavid Galbraith is director of science at Royal Botanical Gardens (RBG). RBG is a leading environmental organization in our community. More information is available at RBG.ca .",
