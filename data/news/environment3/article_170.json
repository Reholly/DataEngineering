    "text": "In short: As interest in sustainable living rises, suburban families are abandoning cities in search of a new lifestyle in the country.\nSome families retain a 'foot in each place' as they transition to a life in a rural locality.\nWhat's next? Recent data suggests a surge in those looking to head out of the city and into the regions.\nThey call it a tree change, city-dwellers upping stumps and heading out bush.\nBut these couples who are ditching suburbia in pursuit of a different lifestyle in Tasmania have taken that literally, as they embark on new careers managing groves of trees.\nAfter living in Perth and Melbourne, Ian and Katherine St Jack were keen to abandon their cosmopolitan lifestyle to escape to a peaceful rural locality in Tasmania's north.\nKelpie Diego discovered this whopping truffle under one of the French oak trees on the farm. ( ABC Rural: Laurissa Smith )\n\"We really wanted to live on 80 to 100 acres and … eat our own produce, make money off the farm, go for walks on the farm, just enjoy ourselves,\" Mr St Jack said.\n\"And here we are in Piper's Brook, living the dream to be honest.\"\nThat dream now includes about 600 French oak trees and a couple of truffle-sniffing dogs.\nHarder than it looks \"[Truffles] seemed like a good idea at the time. I didn’t think there would be much work in it,\" he laughed.\n\"There’s a lot more work than I thought. It’s actually relentless, to be honest.\"\nIan St Jack and his kelpie Diego with one of the black truffles he's unearthed. ( ABC Rural: Laurissa Smith )\nIn addition to working as a paediatrician and an electrician, raising small children and running a truffle business, the couple now fatten their own steers to eat, as well as harvest produce from their 300-square-metre vegetable garden and small orchard.\n\"We’re really just creating that produce for us to eat and live off and raise a young family, and try to do it in the best way we can,\" Mr St Jack said.\nWalking the sustainable talk After working nonstop from her early 20s, most recently for tech-monolith Apple in Singapore and Australia, Sydney-sider Katherine Corrie happily retired from corporate life in 2022.\n\"COVID was a transition of sorts ... it was a nice way for me to get ready for what lay ahead,\" she said.\nDigby Hall and Katherine Corrie have found their slice of Tasmanian paradise at Nemoto, an organic hazelnut farm at Sheffield. ( ABC News: Meg Powell )\nThat future included a \"serendipitous\" romance with her now husband, Digby Hall and beginning the slow process of moving their blended lives down to a picturesque organic hazelnut orchard, about 260 kilometres north of Hobart.\nLoading... While the couple still live between states to allow Mr Hall's sons to finish school, the property, named 'Nemoto', has already become an integral part of their lives.\nFor Mr Hall, an architect who advises government and private clients on climate adaptation, Nemoto was about \"walking the walk\" when it came to the regenerative farming practices he'd so long been advocating for.\n\"It’s not really a stepping away from the corporate world … it’s more a logical next step for what we think is the right way to live,\" he explained.\n\"The long-term future is about the way that we live, the legacy we leave for our boys … literally every project here on the property, we're asking ourselves, 'how does this help our boys and potentially their children?'.\"\nDigby and Katherine are slowly doing up the property while living between Sydney and Tasmania. ( ABC News: Meg Powell )\nBack to basics and the search for sufficiency The couples are not alone in their search for a different lifestyle.\nA recent report from independent think tank the Regional Australia Institute suggests the number of tree changers in Australia hit a 12-month high, sitting at 20 per cent above the pre-COVID average.\nAnalysing data from more than 16 million Commonwealth bank customers, the Institute found people living in metro \"commuter belts\" were leaving to live in regional centres such as the Gold Coast, Wollongong and Launceston.\nKatherine and Digby consider their orchard of hazelnut trees a bonus. ( ABC Rural: Cara Jeffery )\nOnline, a slew of creators promoting an aesthetic, curated vision of self-sufficient living in rural and semi-rural areas has gained popularity; and inspired an internet subculture.\n\"I think the cool kids are calling it homesteading at the moment, but my grandparents back in the day called it survival,\" Mr St Jack quipped.\n\"At the end of the day … raising a young family where we have some acreage and some beautiful quality produce, there's nothing better in the world to be honest.\"\nPosted 18 Jul 2024 18 Jul 2024 Thu 18 Jul 2024 at 10:58pm , updated 19 Jul 2024 19 Jul 2024 Fri 19 Jul 2024 at 12:53am Share\nCopy link\nFacebook\nX (formerly Twitter)\nRelated Stories Will and Michael have found a full life in country Australia.
