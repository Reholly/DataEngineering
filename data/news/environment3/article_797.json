Excess oil can cause clogged pores, acne, and a shiny appearance. Fortunately, our mother nature provides some great solutions that can help manage oily skin effectively. Dr HansaJi Yogendra – Director, of The Yoga Institute, listed five natural ingredients that can help balance oily skin. Incorporating these natural ingredients into your skincare routine can help manage oily skin effectively. While they offer many benefits, it’s essential to use them correctly and in moderation to avoid irritation. Always perform a patch test before trying to ensure they are suitable for your skin type. Home Remedies For Oily Skin Honey Honey is a natural humectant, wherein it draws moisture into your skin without making it oily. It has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties that can help reduce acne and soothe irritated skin. Honey’s gentle yet effective nature makes it suitable for balancing oily skin. Applying a thin layer of raw honey as a face mask for about 10-15 minutes before rinsing off with warm water can help control oil and keep your skin hydrated and clear.

Sadhguru Jaggi Explains](https://english.jagran.com/lifestyle/does-going-to-bed-with-full-stomach-cause-back-pain-sadhguru-jaggi-explains-10174478) Cucumber Cucumber is known for its cooling and astringent properties, making it a great choice for oily skin. It contains a high water content and essential vitamins and minerals that help soothe and hydrate your skin while reducing excess oil. Cucumbers can also tighten pores and reduce the appearance of shine. Applying cucumber juice or using cucumber slices directly on your skin can help to freshen and balance oily skin. Apple Cider Vinegar Home Remedies For Oily Skin (Image Credits: Canva) Apple cider vinegar (ACV) is a popular natural remedy for oily skin due to its astringent properties. It helps to balance the skin’s pH levels and reduce excess oil production. ACV also has antibacterial properties that can help prevent acne. To use ACV, mix one part vinegar with three parts water and apply it to your skin with a cotton ball. Allow it to sit for a few minutes before rinsing off with cold water. It’s important to dilute ACV properly to avoid irritation. Lemon Juice Lemon juice is rich in citric acid, which acts as a natural astringent and helps to control oil production. It also has antibacterial properties that can help combat acne-causing bacteria. The vitamin C in lemon juice brightens your skin and reduces the appearance of scars and blemishes. However, lemon juice can be very potent, so it’s best to dilute it with water and use it sparingly. Apply the diluted lemon juice to your skin, leave it on for about 5-10 minutes, and then rinse off thoroughly. Aloe Vera Aloe vera is a versatile plant known for its soothing and hydrating properties. It contains natural salicylic acid and enzymes that can help exfoliate your skin, removing excess oil and dead skin cells that clog pores. It also has anti-inflammatory properties that can help calm irritated skin and reduce redness associated with acne. Its light, gel-like texture makes it an excellent moisturiser for oily skin. Applying fresh aloe vera gel directly from the plant or using products containing a high percentage of aloe vera can yield beneficial results.
