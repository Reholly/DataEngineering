(Photo by Zheng Erqi/chinadaily.com.cn)\nA grand ceremony was held at a safari park in Guangzhou, Guangdong province, on Thursday to celebrate the first month of a female panda cub born to Mengmeng, the eldest of the world's only giant panda triplets.\nMengmeng gave birth to the cub at the Guangzhou Chimelong Safari Park on June 18 after a 128-day pregnancy. According to the park's conservation team, the cub has grown from 178 grams to 1,230 grams as of Thursday, indicating healthy conditions.\nThe park held a traditional Cantonese ceremony by distributing red eggs to visitors as a symbol of celebration and good luck.\nIn Chinese folklore, red eggs are considered auspicious and symbolize blessings, happiness and peace. They are often given during childbirth or after the baby's first month as a blessing from friends and family for a lifetime of peace, happiness and prosperity.\nThe park will also organize a ceremony at the end of July to celebrate the 10th birthday of the giant panda triplets Mengmeng, Shuaishuai, and Kuku.\nA female panda cub born on June 18 in Guangzhou, Guangdong province, has grown from 178 grams since birth to 1230 grams as of Thursday, showing healthy conditions.
