    "text": "LEBANON, Ind. (WLFI) - The Lebanon Mayor's office confirms statements made by Mayor Matt Gentry regarding the timeline of finding a citywide water solution. Mayor Gentry previously told News 18 Lebanon has always been faced with water supply challenges based on its location, and the way water sources flow away from it. On [episode 169](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsMyDC3-zP4) of the Lovein Lebanon Podcast, Gentry said the best way to overcome the water issue was to use money they receive from incoming investments to pay for it. \"Water rates would go up, we'd have to fund the pipeline ourselves,\" he said in the podcast. \"Having these massive levels of investments that are being talked about in LEAP, and the investments that Lilly is making in LEAP, that will help create that base and demand that will allow us to fund those infrastructure pieces without burdening the rate payers.\" Gentry adds there's a line of developments waiting to get into the LEAP District in Lebanon. He said as soon as the city finds water sources to support these projects, they will be able to begin the next steps of development. Gentry made comments in a report to the Lebanon Reporter saying \"the city is 'a lot closer' to a water solution after negotiations with Central Indiana utilities companies.\" \"We hope to have a path forward before the end of summer. I can't get into specifics, but it's a dramatic increase from where we are today,\" he continued. The Lebanon Mayors office confirmed to News 18 Gentry's comments are true. The report also mentions that potential amount could additionally supply industrial and residential growth in Lebanon. Tippecanoe County Commissioner, Dave Byers, said he and the other commissioners still aren't convinced that the project wouldn't require the use of water in Tippecanoe County. \"You don't just go making promises when you know there's problems down there. I don't think we're over the hump, and I don't think we're clear yet,\" he said. The Lebanon Mayor's Office said Gentry prefers not to comment at this time because \"the water topic remains uncertain.\" They said Mayor Gentry would prefer to wait until a definite decision is made before commenting They told News 18 when a decision is made, they will provide us with the information.",
