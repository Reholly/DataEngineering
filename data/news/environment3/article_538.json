[Devdiscourse News Desk](/news-source/Devdiscourse News Desk)| Rome | Updated: 19-07-2024 11:26 IST | Created: 19-07-2024 11:26 IST During last month’s G7 Leaders Summit, the Italian G7 Presidency reaffirmed its commitment to establishing an ‘AI Hub for Sustainable Development’ in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The release of the first public report on the co-design of the hub today provides initial suggestions and consolidated feedback from local AI ecosystems in Africa. Africa stands on the brink of a significant Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution, driven by a youthful population, dynamic tech ecosystems, and increasing connectivity. This presents a tremendous opportunity to develop and scale local solutions tailored to African contexts. Realizing this potential for inclusive economic growth requires collaborative efforts to propel responsible AI development across the continent. The G7 Leaders’ Declaration affirms that the hub will foster multi-stakeholder partnerships to support local AI digital ecosystems, strengthen capacities to advance AI for sustainable development, and complement existing initiatives, including the AI for Development Donors Partnership. The report emphasizes that the core foundations underpinning AI’s potential for sustainable development include data pipelines, green computational power, and talent. Accelerating responsible private sector innovation and partnerships in these areas is a primary goal of the hub. The hub will work in tandem with governments and local ecosystems to ensure close collaboration with partners focused on AI governance and its local applications. As the Italian G7 Presidency prepares to strengthen the ‘Digital Development: Growing Together’ agenda—a core priority of the G7 in 2024 with a focus on Africa—a new era of collective action is becoming possible. The hub underscores Italy's commitment to a partnership-based approach with African nations, aiming to foster equal cooperation and mutual benefits. In partnership with the G7, the UNDP will continue to serve as a platform to foster new partnerships and investments from both the public and private sectors, ensuring that AI becomes a catalyst for positive change across countries.
