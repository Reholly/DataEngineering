    "text": "Gupta highlighted that Auto LPG, described as a 'Net Zero Hero,' generates 20% less CO2 than petrol and 60% less than diesel. The Indian Auto LPG Coalition (IAC) is urging major Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) like Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors, Hyundai Motor India, Bajaj Auto, and Kia Motors to include Auto LPG in their vehicle lineup. This move aims to promote cleaner and more cost-effective fuel alternatives. Suyash Gupta, Director General of IAC, has reached out to the executives of these companies, emphasizing the significant advantages of Auto LPG.Gupta highlighted that Auto LPG, described as a 'Net Zero Hero,' generates 20% less CO2 than petrol and 60% less than diesel. It emits almost no particulate matter and has considerably lower NOx emissions. \\\"Auto LPG emits 20% less CO2 than petrol and 60% less than diesel, producing almost no particulate matter and significantly lower NOx emissions,\\\" Gupta emphasized, underlining the potential of Auto LPG to reduce air pollution and associated health risks.Additionally, Gupta pointed out the cost benefits, noting that Auto LPG is approximately 40% cheaper than petrol. Converting a petrol vehicle to Auto LPG incurs a cost of about INR 30,000, which is significantly lower than the INR 3-5 lakh required for electric vehicles (EVs).Gupta further elaborated, \\\"Adopting Auto LPG offers numerous advantages for OEMs, including meeting the growing demand for cleaner, economical fuel options amid rising fuel prices and environmental awareness. It provides a competitive edge and cost benefits due to lower conversion and infrastructure costs compared to EVs and CNG. Additionally, Auto LPG helps OEMs comply with India's stricter emission norms, ensuring sustainability.\\\"To underscore the underutilization of Auto LPG in India compared to other countries, Gupta shared global statistics: \\\"Auto LPG has experienced significant global growth over the last few years, with over 27 million vehicles using it and 25 million tonnes consumed annually. Leading the way are countries like Russia, South Korea, Poland, and Italy. In contrast, despite having more than 1,500 Auto LPG stations, India's consumption remains at just 0.35 million tonnes.\\\"The initiative by the IAC is part of an ongoing effort to engage with policymakers and automotive leaders. The goal is to foster a supportive environment for Auto LPG, aligning it with Indiaâ€™s objectives for sustainable development.",
