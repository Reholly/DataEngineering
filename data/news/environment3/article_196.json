    "text": "EPA Administrator Michael Regan offered a message of support for President Joe Biden as questions swirl around the president’s reelection bid. Biden has faced calls to drop out of the race from members of his own party after delivering a poor debate performance against former President Donald Trump last month. Since then, Cabinet officials’ comments about the president are being scrutinized as Democrats are locked in fierce infighting about whether he should remain the party’s 2024 presidential nominee. “I continued to be inspired by [@POTUS](https://x.com/POTUS)’ leadership,” Regan said in [a social media post](https://x.com/EPAMichaelRegan/status/1813955295300682174?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet) Thursday morning. “Every day, I’m proud to serve in an Administration that prioritizes AND invests in Black communities.” The administrator also shared a photo of the president, which appears to be from Biden’s speech before the NAACP national convention Tuesday. Regan also spoke at the meeting earlier this week.",
