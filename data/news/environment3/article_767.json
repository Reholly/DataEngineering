    "text": "There are thousands of fish lovers in our country. The trend of growing fish farming is growing day by day. It is claimed by many as a successful business that yields a decent amount of profit. In recent days, the government has provided subsidies for fish farming which has resulted in the significant increase of fish traders. Usually, the sellers deal in fish seeds of three different sizes: jeera, finger and big. The most commonly used size is jeera. It might be strange for you to know that jeera-sized seeds grow into fish that weigh 1.5kgs to 2kgs. But do you know how long it takes for a fish to grow to its full size? In this article, we will talk about some facts of fish farming. In an interview with Local 18, Sudhir Sahni, a major fish businessman mentioned this business emerged to become very profitable. He owns 90 acres of land where he runs his business. He explained that at first, the pond is cleaned and then the jeera seeds are added. He added that there are many medicines available in the market to make the fish big but it depends on the sellers whether to use it or not. Sudhir advised that one should put the seeds slowly as if all the seeds are added to the water at once then the success rate decreases. There are many species of fish found in India, but there are three major species that fall under the Indian Major Carp (IMC). The major fishes include catla (Catla catla), rohu (Labeo rohita) and mrigal (Cirrhinus mrigala). It takes around nine months to grow IMC fish. Sudhir further mentioned that foreign fish like Pangasius and Senapia take around six months to grow to their full size. The procedure also highly depends on the skill of the farmer. Sudhir further added that when fish farmers lease a pond, they know that fish can only be harvested once or at most twice in a year. The pond is prepared accordingly first then the seeds are added. After a month, the farmers also can add another batch of seeds. The water should be cleaned using nets regularly. It is also vital to keep the fish active. Adding to it, he mentioned that allowing cattle to enter the water also makes the fish more active. It helps in the quick growth of their bodies. The weight can reach more than 2kgs in a year.",
