    "text": "Ahmedabad: The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has thought of a novel way to immortalize a loved one and add citizens’ personalization to the city’s green spaces. On Thursday, AMC’s standing committee gave the go-ahead for the creation of 'memorial parks’ in the city's Chandkheda and Nikol neighborhoods as a pilot project. Here, residents will be allowed to plant trees of their choice and dedicate them to their loved ones. In Chandkheda, the park will be developed in town planning (TP) scheme 44 near Gayatri Circle, spanning 8,481 sq m. Nikol’s memorial park will be situated in town planning (TP) scheme 123/C near Mewad Party Plot over 3,253sq m. AMC has decided on a deposit of Rs 3,100 for each tree and plaque and those joining the initiative will be responsible for the maintenance of their dedicated space for a period of one year. Elaborating on the initiative, standing committee chairman Devang Dani said, “Planting a tree and installing a plaque creates a lasting tribute, allowing citizens to connect with their loved ones with a growing, living thing. Memorial parks can become gathering places for families and friends to share memories and find support. This year, AMC is planning to establish memorial parks in Chandkheda and Nikol with this innovative approach.\\\" The other advantage of creating such spaces, Dani said, was that the “park will consist of a wide variety of trees, since it will have what citizens choose to plant.” Dani assured that AMC will take over the long-term maintenance of the trees. “In case a tree dies naturally or due to unforeseen circumstances, we will replace it with the same species and, if possible, of similar height,” he added.We also published the following articles recentlyMy neighbourhood matters: Broken pumps, infested trees, residents demand revival of parksResidents in sectors 99 and 100 of Noida raise complaints about the deteriorating condition of parks and green belts.
