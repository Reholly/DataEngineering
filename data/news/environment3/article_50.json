    "text": "The Sri Lanka Aquaculture Development Alliance (SLADA), the pioneers in country’s prawn manufacturing industry, expressed concern over the existing procedure of prawn imports to Sri Lanka, and said, at a time when a large number of local prawn farmers produce adequate prawns for local consumption, it is not necessary to import prawns to our country again.\nSLADA Treasurer Chaminda Fernando addressing a media briefing said over 100,000 prawn manufacturers and their families are currently engaged in the industry at Batticaloa, Negombo, Mannar and Hambantota areas and they produce sufficient prawns for local consumption and also for export purposes.\nHe said the SLADA also repeatedly requested responsible authorities to look into this matter positively and take measures to stop prawn imports, considering the livelihood of prawn manufactures and also this a high potential industry to earn foreign exchange.\nHe further highlighted that countries which import prawns from Sri Lanka are also earning a colossal sum of money from re-exports and said even our country too should look for new countries for exports. Fernando further said our country has many potential areas to start prawn farms and requested authorities to encourage farmers to begin more prawn farms.",
