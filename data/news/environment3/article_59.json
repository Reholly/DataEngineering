    "text": "Across Eugene, abandoned materials such as furniture, mattresses, and bicycles that are illegally dumped in the public right of way and in other shared spaces are removed by the Public Works Department, resulting in a stream of bulky material that must be managed. Through a proactive partnership between the City of Eugene’s Public Space Team and BRING Recycling,a local reuse nonprofit, this challenge has become an opportunity for community benefit.\nThe City's Public Space Team is on the front lines of tackling illegal dumping, which includes removal of abandoned bikes and bike parts. Recognizing the potential for these discarded bicycles to be repurposed rather than simply disposed of, the City sought out a collaboration with BRING to ensure that reuse.\nUnder this innovative partnership, abandoned bikes collected by the City during public-right-of-way clean-up efforts are stored at the Public Works Yard for a specified window of time to ensure that they can be collected by their owners. Bikes that are not collected by owners during this holding period are donated to and collected by BRING on a will-call basis. Each bike's serial number is recorded, and the numbers sent to Eugene Police Department staff to ensure that if any of the bikes listed have been reported as stolen, they can be returned to their rightful owners.\nFor bikes that remain unclaimed, the collaboration takes on a sustainable twist. Instead of ending up in a recycling bin or the landfill, these bikes are then considered a donation to BRING, and intact bikes are made available for sale to the community at affordable prices, promoting cycling as an accessible and environmentally friendly mode of transportation, while supporting BRING’s mission and making reused items accessible to the community.\nIn some cases, high-value bike frames and other bike parts that are easily salvageable are also directed to BRING Recycling. There, they are either sold for repair or other reuse or upcycling purposes or responsibly recycled, minimizing waste and maximizing resource efficiency.\nThrough this collaborative effort, the Public Works Department and BRING Recycling are promoting sustainability, community partnerships, and access to affordable transportation options to support a more resilient and environmentally conscious community.\nAdditionally, this work is aligned with the City's broad effort toward Strategic Plan goals to advance climate action and community resilience.\nFor more City updates visit the City Newsroom webpage.",
