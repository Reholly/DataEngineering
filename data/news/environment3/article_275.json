    "text": "Indiana's \"own Indiana Jones\" worked for decades to ensure the shipwreck of the SS Muskegon, one of the finest passenger ships on the Great Lakes in its heyday, would be preserved as Indiana's second Underwater Nature Preserve. On Thursday, amid fanfare in Millennium Plaza, near the mouth of where Trail Creek opens into the great expanse of Lake Michigan, Indiana University Center for Underwater Science and Academic Diving Program Director Charles Beeker saw his work come to fruition. The Muskegon, which was originally known as the Peerless when it was built in Cleveland and launched on the Great Lakes in 1872, was officially preserved as an Underwater Nature Preserve at a ceremony near the Old Lighthouse Museum in Michigan City. It got a plaque and a buoy marking its underwater grave in 30 to 35 feet of water in Lake Michigan about a quarter mile from the shore from Mount Baldy, part of the Indiana Dunes National Park in Michigan City. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources also will offer virtual tours of the shipwreck online for land-lubbers who don't plan to dive to see it. People are also reading… \"I've watched as Charlie has become one of the nation's leading underwater archeologists, one of the leading voices of preservation of maritime history, not only in Indiana but around the globe,\" said Indiana Department of Natural Resources Director Dan Bortner, who grew up diving in quarries in southern Indiana and took his class at IU to learn diving safety. \"Being a so-called landlocked state, a place without oceans, one would likely be surprised to learn that Indiana is home to one of the foremost leaders in underwater archeology, Indiana's own Indiana Jones I guess you could say. Diving in this field is a science and an art. You've got have a passion for it. Now Indiana is home to not one but two Underwater Nature Preserves, forever protected as places of unique historic and cultural significance.\" Indiana is home to more than 300 nature preserves, nearly all of which are on land. In 2013, Beeker helped establish the state's first Underwater Nature Preserve at the site of the shipwreck of the J.D. Marshall, a ship that tragically turned turtle in a gale off the shore of the Indiana Dunes State Park, drowning four crewmen in one of the worst maritime disasters in Indiana history in 1911. \"By becoming an Underwater Nature Preserve, the Muskegon will become one of the most highly protected sites in the state,\" Bortner said. \"By becoming an official Underwater Nature Preserve, the Muskegon will be protected for your lifetime, your children's lifetimes and for generations to come. Conservation continues to be a major part of the mission of the DNR. On October 6, 1910, the Muskegon became a tragic part of our Indiana story. On today, July 18, 2024, we come together to officially commemorate that and attach a physical reminder in perpetuity. For those of you who dive, I hope you have a chance to explore this site and discover the wonders it offers. For the rest of us, we'll look down through Lake Michigan's waves and think back on these shipwrecks and this nation's upward climb through a period of immense change and stormy waters.\" More than 6,000 shipwrecks have gone missing in the Great Lakes, mostly from the heyday of commercial shipping in the 1800s but date as far back as when the French explorer and fur trader René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle piloted the first vessel on the Great Lakes in the 1600s. An estimated 50 shipwrecks lie with the 241 square miles of Lake Michigan that fall within Indiana's boundaries. Beeker has been surveying the Muskegon, a 220-foot-long ship that could carry 1,200 tons of cargo since the 1980s. He helped get it listed on the National Register of Historic Places. \"It was the first shipwreck recognized in our waters,\" he said. \"It was the first on the National Register. It and the J.D. Marshall were in shallow water, readily accessible, representative of a maritime heritage not only of Indiana but of the Great Lakes region. They should be open to the public. We have two sites that are Nature Preserves. It adds an extra layer of protection. That means you'll be able to go out to both those sites. They'll be a mooring buoy. They'll be a historic marker identifying it readily seen from Mount Baldy or Crescent Beach identifying it.\" The SS Muskegon is close to shore and can be reached reached by a beginning diver or even a highly skilled snorkeler. It's also visible from the surface on a day when the water's clear. \"They're less than 30 feet deep and accessible,\" he said. \"A lot of Great Lakes divers want to go to the deep wrecks — and there are better wrecks in other areas, you might argue — but I would say the advantage of these two and the reason they're important is they're our wrecks. They're Indiana wrecks. They're open to the public. You can go there and see the limestone plaque we installed yesterday. It's really it's own little park. That's the advantage of being a nature preserve, the management and interpretative materials you can see from the National Park Services and the Indiana Dunes State Park. Again, it's ours. I've worked around California and Florida at various state parks and at National Marine Sanctuaries. I've worked in the Shipwreck Trail in Florida Keys and the Dominican Republic. Now we have this site we're dedicated. I'm proud to be working in our own state.\" Northwest Indiana has a rich maritime history with a lot of cargo passing through Lake Michigan, said Sam Haskell, assistant director for IU's Center for Underwater Science. It's also visible from the surface on a day when the water's clear. \"The Great Lakes are intrinsic to the people and the culture,\" he said. \"You had so much commerce coming out of Chicago, so much commerce coming out of this part of Northern Indiana.\" The Muskegon was described as one of the finest ships on the Great Lakes when it went into service in 1872, Haskell said. \"It served from Chicago to Duluth. It ferried people and cargo all up and down the Great Lakes,\" he said. \"You could have a nice weekend trip aboard the Peerless stateroom and have a wonderful, wonderful (time) while it was also carrying goods.\" In the time before highways, people took ferries across the Great Lakes that were typically lushly appointed with finely decorated interior salons, gourmet food and live bands. The Muskegon had elegant accommodations with chandeliers, vaulted ceilings, fluted pillars, ornate wood railings and other luxurious furnishings in both its stateroom and cabins. \"It was classy,\" he said. \"You could go on board, have a nice meal and drinks and ultimately come back to Chicago or another port city.\" The ship went on to serve other roles, including as a gambling vessel. It hauled lumber from lumberyards to railroads. It ultimately ended up as a sand sucker barge that sucked sand off the bottom of Lake Michigan and ferried it to railcars so it could be used for construction and manufacturing materials. In 1910, the Muskegon burned down in Trail Creek where it sat for nearly a year. A kerosene spill was suspected. It was stripped of all its sand sucking equipment over time and eventually towed out into Lake Michigan and sunk off the shore by Mount Baldy. \"It's been there ever since,\" Haskell said. \"We are very excited to formally dedicate this shipwreck, which is very representative of a swathe of Great Lakes heritage and commerce, as a Nature Preserve.\" A look back at Northwest Indiana businesses that closed in 2023 A look back at Region businesses that closed in 2023 Beer Geeks, one of the Region's first, most beloved and most influential craft beer bars, closed after more than a decade and is being reimagined as a new concept.
