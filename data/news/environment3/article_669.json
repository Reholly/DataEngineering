    "text": "It was a torrential downpour that overwhelmed public infrastructure. Rainwater poured into Union Station and flooded the DVP. The storm seeped into Toronto City Hall and even drowned out a provincial news conference, but the Ontario Science Center stood its ground. Did it crack? Did it collapse? What happened? Thankfully, thankfully to God, it did not. But we have staff there monitoring everything. Nothing happened. Thank goodness this time. The Ford government shut down the tourist attraction after an engineering report said rain or snow could lead to the collapse of roofing panels. The government acknowledged that the 97mm of rain this week was a test of the Science center&#039;s integrity. It was and thank God nothing happened. But again, health and safety is always the number one priority. Thank goodness nothing happened. But what if it did but it didn&#039;t? No, but you always have to be cautious. Critics believe the structure has proven itself to be resilient and capable of being reopened to the public. This was a record-breaking rainfall. You know, in, in Toronto, there was flooding everywhere. The Science Center roof held up. Doesn&#039;t that bolster the idea, though, that maybe it&#039;s safe and you guys were a bit premature in closing it down? No, not, not at all. It&#039;s I&#039;m not chancing, you know, I&#039;m not putting kids in. There are people at any given time it could collapse. Both the premier and the province&#039;s infrastructure minister are adamant they&#039;re not taking a risk. It&#039;s also the snow, right? It&#039;s the weight of the snow in the winter, which is why I had to be decommissioned. Critics are calling for immediate action. Open the bloody thing up right now, right here. A decision that rests solely with the premier just doesn&#039;t make sense. Not throwing good money into a bad building, and one that he&#039;s already ruled out. Premier Doug Ford has already indicated repairing the roof of the Science Center would cost some $500 million / 20 years, something that he&#039;s unwilling to do. Critics claim, though, that all of this is intentional. Of course. The Ford government has a plan to move the Science Center programming down to a brand new location at Ontario Place. Reporting live at Queens Park, I&#039;m Colin D&#039;mello.",
