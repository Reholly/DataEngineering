    "text": "French cellist Christian-Pierre La Marca heads to the Australian Festival of Chamber Music in North Queensland with a powerful message and premiere 'concert-show' While the eyes of the world may be turned to France and the Paris Olympics for the next month, French cellist Christian-Pierre La Marca is headed to Townsville-Gurambilbarra in North Queensland with a powerful message for music fans – we need to save the world, now! Hailed by international classical music bible Gramophone as \"a master of his instrument\" and declared by Le Monde as part of \"the French cello elite,\" Christian-Pierre La Marca has established a formidable international presence. He has performed at premier concert venues worldwide, including the Philharmonie de Paris, Southbank Centre in London, Musikverein Vienna, and Marinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg and from July 26 through to August 4, he will perform at the Australian Festival of Chamber Music (AFCM). In short, he is a classical music force of nature, and he's using that force to save nature across the world. Here's how. He's the creator of one of the highlight events at AFCM, that being Evening Concert 2 – Wonderful World: An Orchestra Experience on Wednesday, 31 July, 7.30pm at the Townsville Civic Theatre. It is the Queensland premiere of the concert. This unique 'concert-show' is world-leading and takes audiences on an immersive journey of our amazing planet. La Marca is accompanied by Lithuanian born pianist Itamar Golan and the AYO Momentum Ensemble (a 10-piece string ensemble) and performs classical, jazz and current tunes including Moon River, Somewhere over the Rainbow and What a Wonderful World. That's not all! The show features a multi-media visual backdrop of stunning scenery by French environmentalist and photographer Yann Arthus-Bertrand and celebrates the beauty of our world while recognising the need to protect it. It will be an important and quite spectacular event, and one to remember. Reflecting on the origins of Wonderful World, La Marca said: \"I was worried, and I was trying to act on it. I didn't know what to do [and] if I could do something. And then, by chance, I met this great photographer and filmmaker, Yann Arthus-Bertrand. He talks about acting at your own level, and from this point of view, I started to think, 'Well, what can I do with my instrument?'\" This meeting inspired La Marca to create the Concert for the Planet, which saw performances in 2018 and 2019 before being paused due to the pandemic. Determined to continue his mission, La Marca developed Wonderful World, a \"concert show\" that combines his musical prowess with the visual artistry of Arthus-Bertrand's films. \"Music has the ability to awaken consciences, to make people more sensitive, without trying to convince or mobilize them. Music is a short circuit that goes straight to the heart,\" he said. The repertoire for the concert flows seamlessly from classical to jazz, showcasing compositions by Johann Sebastian Bach, Gabriel Fauré, Ludwig van Beethoven, Ludovico Einaudi, and more, while the \"architecture\" of the performance, as La Marca calls it, is thoughtfully arranged around Arthus-Bertrand's films. Wonderful World Concert Repertoire: - Johann Sebastian Bach – Suite No. 1 in G major for Cello, BWV 1007: Prelude - Gabriel Fauré – \"Après un Rêve\" for Cello and Piano, Op. 7, No. 1 - Ludwig van Beethoven – Sonata for Cello and Piano, Op.102 No.4: Andante-Allegro - Fazil Say – Sonata for Cello and Piano (Four Cities) - Sivas, Hopa - Antonín Dvořák – From the Bohemian Forest: Silent Woods - Ariel Ramírez – Alfonsina y el Mar - Camille Saint-Saëns – \"The Swan\" from Carnival of the Animals - Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov – Flight of the Bumblebee from The Legend of Tsar Saltan - Philip Glass – The Hours - The Poet Acts - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart – Eine kleine Nachtmusik, K. 525 - Henry Mancini (Johnny Mercer) – Moon River from Breakfast at Tiffany's - Ludovico Einaudi – I giorni - Nils Frahm – Ambre from Wintermusik - Piotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky – Valse Sentimentale for Cello and Piano, Op. 51, No. 6 - Ernest Bloch – From Jewish Life: Prayer - Harold Arlen – The Wizard of Oz: Somewhere over the Rainbow - Astor Piazzolla – Libertango - Bob Thiele (George David Weiss) – What a Wonderful World This year, from 26 July to 4 August, more than 35 artists including 10 international artists, 20 Australian artists and 5 ensembles, will create the music and atmosphere in Townsville-Gurambilbarra for which the AFCM is famed around the world.
