    "text": "Karnataka : Coca-Cola India, through its foundation Anandana, has partnered with Gram Unnati to launch “Project Unnati Mango” in the Kolar and Ramanagara districts of Karnataka. This project, launched ahead of Mango Day, aims to enhance sustainable mango cultivation and boost productivity as well as the profitability of farmers cultivating Alphonso and Totapuri varieties in these districts. In line with Coca-Cola’s Viksit Kisan campaign and the Government’s Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan, the project will train and equip farmers with modern techniques like High-Density plantations and drip irrigation, empowering them and improving their livelihoods.\nAdditionally, as part of the project, Anandana- The Coca-Cola India Foundation is collaborating with state horticulture agencies such as Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK), the Mango Board, the Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (IIHR), and various district horticulture departments in Karnataka to promote the best agricultural practices among farming communities. This initiative will help farmers improve mango yields, quality, size, and shelf life. It also provides comprehensive support, including skill training and financial literacy enhancement.\nCommenting on the launch, Aneesh Jain, CEO and Founder, Gram Unnati , said, “Gram Unnati is proud to partner with Anandana- The Coca-Cola India Foundation on this transformative project that underscores our commitment to sustainable agriculture and farmer empowerment. By adopting modern practices and focusing on quality, we aim to significantly enhance the livelihoods of mango farmers in Karnataka. Together, we will drive sustainable growth and innovation in mango farming, benefiting farmers and the environment alike.”\n“Farmers are the backbone of India’s horticulture system. With Project Unnati Mango, we aim to elevate the livelihoods of these farmers with advanced horticulture solutions, empowering them to significantly increase their incomes. This aligns with the Government of India’s vision for AtmaNirbhar Bharat, making the agrarian economy self-reliant”, said, Rajesh Ayapilla, Senior Director- CSR and Sustainability for Coca-Cola India and Southwest Asia.\nFurthermore, the project will also provide crop advisory services, climate forecasting, and alert systems to equip farmers with climate-smart techniques and improve crop traceability and sustainability. Special training modules have also been designed to empower female farmers, promoting gender equality in agriculture.\nAbout Project Unnati Program – Project Unnati Mango is an integral part of Coca-Cola’s Fruit Circular Economy initiative, which is centered on sustainable agriculture. This initiative by the company focuses on driving farm-level efficiencies through the implementation of best-practice techniques, such as ultra-high-density plantation (UHDP) and drip irrigation. Project Unnati is a key pillar of Coca-Cola India’s ESG priorities – Sustainable Agriculture. Over the past 10 years, Project Unnati has helped empower and enable nearly 4 lakh fruit farmers across 13 states and Union Territories in India. Focused on seven crop varieties Mango, Apple, Orange, Grapes, Litchi, Coffee, and sugarcane, the program is\naimed at propelling the horticulture supply chain and building agriculture production capacities across the country.",
