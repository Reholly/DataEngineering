    "text": "Morocco’s economy has demonstrated resilience in the face of global economic slowdowns, inflation shocks, and natural disasters, according to a recent World Bank report. The economy saw a 3.4 percent increase in real output in 2023, driven by the recovery of key sectors such as tourism, export-oriented manufacturing in automobiles and aeronautics, and a rebound in private consumption. The report highlights Morocco’s impressive external performance, buoyed by booming Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) announcements that promise significant development opportunities. International confidence in Morocco is underscored by favorable country risk indicators, while the composition of Moroccan exports shows increasing complexity, largely due to a post-pandemic surge in capital-intensive industries. Macroeconomic policies supporting this growth include a robust public sector, which has expanded significantly post-pandemic to sustain aggregate demand amidst economic shocks. Successful fiscal management has reduced the budget deficit, although strategies like innovative financing operations are being used to manage the government’s real estate assets, albeit with potential future financial obligations. Bank Al-Maghrib’s cautious monetary policies have effectively managed inflation following recent price shocks, contributing to Morocco’s rapid disinflation process. However, despite overall economic growth, Moroccan businesses and households continue to struggle with challenges such as rising business insolvencies and a tepid labor market, which saw nearly 200 thousand job losses in rural areas in 2023. Per capita consumption has only marginally recovered to pre-pandemic levels, underscoring the lingering impact of recent economic shocks on welfare. The government’s new direct social aid program aims to alleviate pressure on poorer households. Looking ahead, Morocco’s economy is projected to moderate in 2024 with expected agricultural challenges leading to a 2.9 percent growth rate. A weak agricultural campaign is anticipated to contract agricultural value added by 3.3 percent due to adverse weather conditions. However, non-agricultural sectors are poised for resilience driven by domestic demand recovery and a robust industrial sector. Growth is forecasted to improve from 2025 onwards assuming normal agricultural conditions. The report includes a special focus on Morocco’s private sector dynamics, revealing lackluster productivity performance and challenges in allocative efficiency. Larger firms exhibit lower productivity compared to smaller counterparts, hindering the market’s ability to reward efficiency and innovation adequately. Moroccan SMEs struggle to scale up, and the density of High Growth Firms remains low, despite their potential to significantly contribute to job creation. Addressing these constraints within the private sector is crucial to enhancing Morocco’s job creation capacity and overcoming recent economic challenges.",
