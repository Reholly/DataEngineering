    "text": "The Green Flag Award is the international quality mark for parks and green spaces, bestowed in recognition of the hard work and dedication of the staff that care for the spaces so that they can be enjoyed by all who use and visit them.\nAs a result of this year’s awards, 2,227 parks – the largest number since the scheme began 28 years ago – are proudly preparing to raise their flags.\nReflecting on the continued dedication of the University’s Grounds Team, Stuart Bonney, Brunel’s Director of Estates Development and Infrastructure, remarked: “I’m once again immensely proud of the hard work that our Grounds Team have done to retain the campus’s Green Flag Award for the eighth year in a row.\n“Not only do our green spaces provide an oasis of calm, they afford our staff, students, visitors and the wider community a variety of open spaces in which to work, study, relax and catch up with friends. The broad spectrum of trees and plants give a lot of visual interest all year round and are a haven for wildlife.\n“The Grounds Team richly deserve this award and I know I speak for the entire University community in giving my thanks to Paul Buxton and his team for this wonderful achievement.”\nKeep Britain Tidy’s Green Flag Award Scheme Manager, Paul Todd MBE, said: “I would like to congratulate everyone involved at Brunel University London on achieving a Green Flag Award.\n“Brunel’s campus in Uxbridge is a vital green space for the community in West London and it provides important opportunities for campus users to improve their physical and mental health.\n“We know that staff and volunteers work tirelessly to ensure that it maintains the high standards of the Green Flag Award. Everyone involved should feel extremely proud of their achievement.”\nThe Green Flag Award scheme, managed by environmental charity Keep Britain Tidy under licence from the Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government, recognises and rewards well-managed parks and green spaces, setting the benchmark standard for the management of green spaces across the United Kingdom and around the world.",
