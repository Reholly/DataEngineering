PHOTO: AFP The successful mass hatching shows the vital importance of protecting the Cardamom National Park, said Mr Pablo Sinovas, country director of Fauna and Flora Cambodia programme.\n“With only a few hundred individuals estimated in the wild, the hatching of 60 new crocodiles is a tremendous boost,” Mr Sinovas added.\nAccording to conservation group World Wide Fund for Nature, the Mekong River basin and wetlands in Cambodia appear to hold the only remaining wild populations of Siamese crocodiles, which grow up to 3m in length.\nThey are listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.
