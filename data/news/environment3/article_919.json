    "title": "Papua New Guinea agri sector experiences a surge in demand for fresh onions",
    "text": "In Papua New Guinea, the agriculture sector is experiencing a surge in demand for fresh bulb onions, with prices escalating to K150 per net at Lae's main market, a notable increase from the usual K120. John Pena, an onion farmer, highlighted the persistent high demand for this crop. Supermarkets such as Papindo, Raumai 18, and Big V are among the primary purchasers of these onions, providing local farmers with significant market exposure. Despite this, logistical challenges and weather conditions are major barriers to scaling production. Chimbu Province stands out as the country's leading region for bulb onion supply, as stated by farmer Billy Komb. The competition from imported onions, while challenging, has spurred local farmers towards enhancing their product quality. Komb detailed the labor-intensive cultivation process, which involves a meticulous schedule of fertilization and disease prevention to ensure the growth and maturity of the onions over a four to five-month period.
