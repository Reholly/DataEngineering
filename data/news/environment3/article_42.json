    "text": "The coordinated efforts in Barbados, Grenada, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG) serve as testament to the progress made and the areas that still require attention. Barbados recently approved its Multi-Hazard Early Warning Systems (MHEWS) policy, establishing clear roles, sustainability, and financing for the system. This framework was put to the test during Hurricane Beryl, and the results are promising. The Barbados Meteorological Services (BMS), Department of Emergency Management (DEM), and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) collaborated effectively to provide timely warnings. The United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) supported the DEM with data generation, aiding in developing multi-hazard impact scenarios, significantly enhancing preparedness, planning and response strategies. These coordinated efforts strengthened preparedness and helped Barbados reduce the hurricane's potential impacts. In Grenada and SVG, the collaboration and strong coordination between the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA) and the United Nations Emergency Technical Team (UNETT) chaired by the United Nations Resident Coordinator, in the framework of the Caribbean Development Partners Group for Disaster Management were vital. Similarly, at the regional level the Caribbean Institute for Meteorology and Hydrology (CIMH) monitored the storm progress and shared updates with CDEMA and other stakeholders, notably by creating forecasts and models predicting the hurricane's potential impact, track, intensity, and potential landfall areas. While these two countries suffered important damages, the coordination between the different actors facilitated an effective response, especially in the disaster-declared zones of Carriacou, and Petite Martinique, in Grenada, and Union Island, Canouan and Mayreau, in SVG. Despite initial logistical challenges such as rough seas and road blockages, the operational seaport in Carriacou enabled the timely distribution of relief items. Information management and coordination efforts were crucial in improving the response's effectiveness by identifying data sources and characterizing the affected areas. The collaboration with Microsoft and MapAction allowed for precise analysis of satellite imagery from Planet and COPERNICUS, respectively, providing critical information on infrastructure damage shortly after the hurricane's impact. This integration was pivotal in identifying the location of damaged infrastructure and facilitating a rapid response, while supporting the actions of different response clusters, such as the shelter one. The local private sector also played a crucial role in the response efforts for Hurricane Beryl. Members of ARISE in the Caribbean, including the Barbados Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BCCI), the Grenada Chamber of Industry and Commerce, AMCHAM Trinidad & Tobago, and CARICHAM, united to support the response. The BCCI mobilized its members to provide relief supplies and financial aid in Barbados, distributing essential items such as water, non-perishable food, and building materials. The Grenada Chamber encouraged donations of water, canned goods, hygiene products, and building materials. AMCHAM T&T collaborated with regional chambers to gather funds, supplies, and resources for recovery efforts. CARICHAM coordinated with member chambers to assess needs and distribute relief supplies across affected communities. The impact of Hurricane Beryl highlighted several areas that require further attention. The fisheries sector in Barbados suffered significantly, with 209 boats affected and 9 lost, many of which were uninsured (90%). Similarly, the housing sector was heavily impacted, the initial reports are very tragic, with areas that has experienced severe devastation (95% of homes damaged or destroyed in Carriacou, 100% in Petite Martinique, and 90% in Union Island) with significant roof and structural damage. Critical infrastructure like schools and hospitals were destroyed. Residents suffered disruption of the electricity, water, and communication services. The destruction of rainwater harvesting systems worsened the situation. This points to the need for more resilient infrastructure and the retrofitting of both public buildings and private housing to withstand future hurricanes. Enhanced construction practices, such as connecting roofs and improving overall building standards through the use of building codes, are essential for increasing resilience against more intense storms anticipated in the future. National Disaster Risk Management Offices (NDRMOs) were instrumental in developing impact scenarios and coordinating responses. Their holistic and people-centered approach to risk facilitated a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and needs. Working closely with CDEMA, OCHA, and members of the UNETT, these efforts not only improved the immediate response but also identified medium- to long-term recovery needs. The insights gained and actions outlined above, as well as the EU's deployment of environment and waste and debris management specialists, and the incorporation of the DRR approach into the plan's projects of the regional overview and planned response are part of the robust action plan under the recently signed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the region and the EU, including with the European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations, which will contribute to enhancing CDEMA's capacities and promoting a resilient recovery from the outset. The importance of Multi-Hazard Early Warning Systems (MHEWS) cannot be overstated, as they play a critical role in safeguarding lives and minimizing the impact of hazards that can trigger disasters. The EW4All initiative, led by UNDRR, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), and supported by the whole United Nations and regional intergovernmental institutions, such as CDEMA, exemplifies this commitment. By ensuring that timely and accurate warnings based on the impacts reach vulnerable populations, the EW4All Initiative aims to enhance community preparedness and response capabilities. This collaborative effort integrates advanced technology, effective communication strategies, and local knowledge, thereby creating a robust and inclusive framework that significantly reduces disaster risks and fosters resilience. The response to Hurricane Beryl in the Caribbean has demonstrated the effectiveness of Multi-Hazard Early Warning Systems and the value of coordinated efforts in disaster risk reduction. While significant impacts were felt, the proactive measures taken by Barbados, Grenada, and SVG, supported by the United Nations and other partners, have mitigated potential damages. As the Caribbean continues to face the threat of the hurricane season, the lessons learned from Hurricane Beryl will guide efforts to enhance preparedness, response, and early recovery, ensuring the safety and well-being of its communities.
