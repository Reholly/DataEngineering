    "text": "This partnership allows both companies to work together along the European value chain, enlarging ecosystems to recycle materials obtained from end-of-life vehicles\nPublished 8 hours ago\nSubmitted by DOW\nMIDLAND, Mich., July 18, 2024 /CSRwire/ -\nDow (NYSE: DOW) and Fiori Group, a company that collects, stores and processes ferrous and non-ferrous materials, announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to collaborate in the development of a new ecosystem for recycling end-of-life (EOL) parts and materials of vehicles.\nThe MoU addresses both companies’ intent to handle analysis of the dismantling process and its impact on EOL waste fraction quality and suitability for recycling processes, as well as to create the new ecosystem business model under a ‘test and learn’ practice. Fiori Group and Dow MobilityScience™ teams will provide timely updates on experiments’ results, collaborating transparently to create a valuable prototype for recycling EOL vehicle parts and materials.\n“Our extensive capabilities in the reuse of metals and non-metal materials, and the sorting of different materials from end-of-life vehicles, have positioned us as a market leader for recycling in Italy,” said Mauro Grotto, vice president of Italmetalli, a Fiori Group company. “Our collaboration with Dow grants us to be ranked in the forefront of seeking new solutions to reach European end-of-life vehicle recycling targets and is in line with our guiding pillars of scientific research, restoring the value of waste and communicating this value in an open and educational way\".\n“As two leaders committed to fostering a circular economy for polymers, plastics and polyurethanes, collaborative innovation is key to accelerating sustainable mobility,” said Dr. Esther Quintanilla, Dow’s global MobilityScience™ marketing director. “By joining forces with Fiori Group, we are strengthening our commitment to a sustainable future for the automotive industry through our leading materials in this key growth segment and their expertise in expanding the recycled fraction from end-of-life vehicles.”\nAs part of its sustainability strategy, Dow is increasingly focused on new sustainable solutions including new technology for mechanical and chemical recycling from different materials that are currently considered waste. The collaboration between Dow and Fiori Group will be an automotive and mobility recycling program featuring the Dow\nRenuva™ portfolio of recycled materials.\nWith world-class technical capabilities and a diverse portfolio of materials science options, Dow MobilityScience™ pioneers innovation that drives global progress. From addressing challenges like decarbonization to enhancing EV performance, Dow remains at the forefront of advancing mobility.
