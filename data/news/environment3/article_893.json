    "text": "Turquoise blue waters, pristine white sands and idyllic seaside vibes galore — the island nation of Maldives certainly has no shortage of picture-postcard beaches and longing beach bums are absolutely spoiled for choice. Come, savour a slice of sun, sand and sea in the tropical island paradise.\nArguably the most famous of public beaches in the Maldives, Hulhumale Beach is a common spot on most travellers’ itineraries, not necessarily for its seaside grandeur but for the convenience of access afforded by its location close to the island nation’s airport. The white sandy beach may not be the most serene slice of beach to call the tropical islands home, but it still is one of those beaches the sun lover in you just doesn't want to pass up.\nDespite the Maldives’ hit hotspot tourist status, the South Asian nation is still pretty much set back in its ways and the country’s culturally conservative views are observed to date unwaveringly. Steeped in such an atmosphere, bikinis aren’t the most popular piece of clothing, even despite its literally innumerable beaches and the aptly-named Bikini Beach on Rasdhoo Island is one of the few public beaches in the tropical islands that allow the piece of swimwear. To add more to your delight, the palm-fringed beach also affords a stunning seaside view.\nUnlike most other beaches that call the Maldives call home, this slice of beach on Vaadhoo Island isn’t one that’s meant to be enjoyed in the soothing tropical sun. As a matter of fact, it is a beach that comes alive once the sun goes down. As darkness descends upon the beautiful archipelagic nation, the bioluminescent plankton that inhabit the surrounding waters wash up on shore, creating a breathtaking “glow-in-the-dark beach”. Treat yourself to what is one of the best\n things to do in Maldives and with a delightful day behind you, retreat to a fine hotel or resort on the tropical islands, including the likes of Saii Lagoon Maldives.\nAs if the archipelagic nation has a shortage of pristine sandy beaches, the country is also home to an artificial beach and is supposedly the only man-made beach in the Maldives. Artificial Beach, as it is aptly named, takes the shape of a crescent and is a popular beach destination for many travellers heading to the islands’ capital city, Male. Although man-made, beachgoers hardly recognise its distinction from the hundreds of other beaches in the archipelago.\nLong, narrow and wonderfully serene, the charming Fulhadhoo Beach is one of the most tranquil public beaches the Maldives has to offer. Unlike most other islands of the archipelago, this laid-back island in the Baa Atoll has hardly seen any commercialisation and its authentic tropical charm is still intact, untouched and unmarred. For those seeking a moment of peace and quiet to lose yourself in immersive seaside contemplation, a visit to this charming slice of beach surely wouldn’t disappoint.",
