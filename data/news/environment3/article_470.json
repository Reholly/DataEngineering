    "text": "SINGAPORE , July 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The 'Summit-Friendship Solar Village' project, located in Kabilpur within the Gaibandha district of Bangladesh , has received the prestigious Reuters' Global Energy Transition Awards 2024 under the 'Projects of Impact' category in New York, USA on 25th June 2024 . Among 500 entries this year from around the globe, this project was nominated for its concrete results in terms of improved energy affordability, and compensation for losses to improve local resilience for climate change.\nThe 'Summit-Friendship Solar Village' project announced as one of the winners at the Reuters' Global Energy Transition Awards 2024 under the 'Projects of Impact' category in New York, USA.\nThis 57.6 kW scalable solar microgrid now benefits the 3,000 inhabitants of Kabilpur, Gaibandha. Kabilpur itself is a char-a remote sedimentary landmass found within a river-but finds itself ideally placed to act as hub for neighbouring chars within the Jamuna River, upon which it is situated.\n\"Summit wants to serve 100% of Bangladesh with infrastructure such as electricity and communication. Most chars fall outside the national grid. I believe these chars, like the rest of Bangladesh , deserve electricity. The award-winning NGO, Friendship, has done wonders. It's a privilege to provide solar energy to the 3,000 people of Kabilpur Char in association with Friendship,\" remarked Muhammed Aziz Khan , Chairman of Summit Power International.",
