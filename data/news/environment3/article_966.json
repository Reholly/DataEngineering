    "text": "German company Lilium is the developer of the world’s first fully electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft. The Lilium aircraft features large cabins that can accommodate up to six guests plus luggage.\nAgreement signing ceremony\nThe deal follows a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between the two parties in October 2022, which marks an industry milestone as the largest firm order for eVTOL aircraft. The agreement includes a timeline for aircraft deliveries, performance guarantees, comprehensive fleet maintenance and support services. In addition, the two parties intend to sign a “Lilium POWER ON” agreement that will include fleet maintenance and support services.\nWith its leadership, the Saudi Group will be the first company in the Middle East and North Africa region to own fully electric eVTOL aircraft, reflecting our commitment to implementing initiatives that support sustainable aviation in line with the goals of Saudi Vision 2030 in this field.\nElectric aircraft provide new routes for transporting guests with the advantage of being able to take off and land vertically, covering a distance of up to 175 kilometers at a speed of up to 250 kilometers per hour, thus saving guests’ time by approximately 90% compared to other transportation options and representing a solution to the challenge of congestion. They serve the business and exhibitions sector to facilitate the transportation of guests to attend and participate in these events. They also provide a qualitative option for tourist destinations as well as sports and entertainment events, while at the same time connecting the guests of God to Makkah Al-Mukarramah and the holy sites. In addition, they are environmentally friendly, making them one of the enablers of sustainable air travel.\nThe Saudi Group will receive the first aircraft in 2026, where its operation will be approved according to the regulations that ensure safety and quality by the General Authority of Civil Aviation in the Kingdom, while its operations will be operated and managed by the Saudi Private Aviation Company.\nSource: RT\n#Saudia #Group #signs #largest #global #order #purchase #electric #aircraft\n2024-07-19 11:13:41",
