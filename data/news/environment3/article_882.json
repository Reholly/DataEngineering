    "text": "From Hartland to Hurlstone Point the National Trust is carrying out sea life surveys across 100 miles of coast between the 26 July - 4 August, with events open to the public. Join rangers and volunteers to take part in surveys at Heddon’s Mouth, Mortehoe, and Hurlstone Point, along with rockpool rambles and a silent disco beach clean being held at Woolacombe. This is an opportunity for families, nature enthusiasts, and anyone looking to learn more about identifying sea life species to get involved and help collect important data about UK sea life. Amy U’Ren, volunteering & community officer for North Devon National Trust, said: “After the success of last year’s surveys we are excited to be able to welcome the public to get involved again and have fun while learning about surveying and coastal environments.” Taking place during the National Whale and Dolphin Watch run by the Sea Watch Foundation, results from these surveys will be submitted to the organisation, helping to create a ‘snapshot’ of what can be seen in UK coastal waters. Volunteers are essential for the work carried out by the National Trust and these events offer a chance for people to learn more about volunteering across North Devon and Exmoor and the type of roles involved. Amy said: “We are always looking for people who love nature and the outdoors to join our friendly, welcoming volunteering community. If you have ever wanted to give volunteering a try, come along to one of these events and meet the team.” To find out more about the sea life survey events and how to get involved visit: What's on in North Devon l Devon | National Trust . Survey events and Woolacombe silent disco beach clean are free drop-in sessions. Booking is essential for rockpool rambles which take place all through the summer and costs £5 per ticket. If you are interested in further volunteering opportunities, please contact [northdevon@nationaltrust.org.uk](mailto:northdevon@nationaltrust.org.uk).",
