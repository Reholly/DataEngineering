    "text": "An Open Mind to Embrace Sci-tech Participants visit a greenhouse at the opening ceremony of the China-Romania Joint Laboratory for Cooperation in Agriculture in Bucharest, Romania, on June 25, 2024. (PHOTO: XINHUA) Edited by Staff Reporters China has made new breakthroughs in basic frontier research, taken new strides in strategic high-tech fields, and achieved new results in high-quality development driven by innovation. It has opened up new prospects in the reform of the sci-tech system, and made new progress in sci-tech opening-up and cooperation with the rest of the world. Sci-tech progress is a global issue. Independent innovation in the new era means coordinating resources in an open environment, it is not something that can be done behind closed doors. In fact, China's sci-tech innovation has never been closed innovation. From the teamwork in the early days to joint research and exchange activities after the reform and opening up in 1978, cooperation has always been a distinctive feature of the country's science and technology development. In recent years, Beijing has been focusing on strengthening international sci-tech innovation cooperation extensively, is actively engaged in the global innovation network, and is participating in global technology governance, taking the lead in organizing international \"big science\" plans. To respond to global challenges and promote development, China has provided its wisdom and strength, demonstrating its leading role in global innovation. With the world having entered a new period of turbulence and transformation, the more complex the global environment is, the more we must open our minds and door. To achieve sci-tech self-reliance and strength through openness and cooperation and further the implementation of international sci-tech cooperation initiatives, all countries should broaden their channels for exchanges and collaborations at both governmental and non-governmental levels. More leveraging platforms such as the Belt and Road Initiative are needed to support collaborative research by scientists worldwide. So far, 146 foreign experts, three international organizations and one foreign organization have won China's International Science and Technology Cooperation Award since 1995. It is a tribute to the foreign scientists and researchers who have devoted themselves to sci-tech exchanges and cooperation with China. Non-governmental communication and cooperation is an important part of promoting open cooperation in science and technology. Scientists and research institutions from different parts of the world can gather together to discuss frontier technology and share updated research results via international science and technology forums, seminars, and innovation competitions. The experience accumulated from the sci-tech development in the new era, including sci-tech opening-up and cooperation for the benefit of all, should be put into practice and enriched. China is ready to promote technology sharing and reduce technical barriers, working together with the others to create an open, fair, just and non-discriminatory science and technology development environment. China also aims to deepen sci-tech opening-up and cooperation by drawing on global wisdom, and thereby make greater contributions to building a community with a shared future for all.",
