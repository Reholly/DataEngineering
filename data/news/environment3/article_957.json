    "text": "With energy production, [pollinator](https://www.thecooldown.com/green-home/how-to-make-your-yard-a-friendlier-place-for-pollinators/) protection, and crop growth promotion, [agrivoltaics](https://cleantechnica.com/2024/06/08/agrivoltaic-solar-arrays-will-win-the-rural-solar-war-with-insects/), an innovative approach to [solar power](https://www.thecooldown.com/solar-panels/), has the potential to provide a reasonable answer to growing rural backlash against solar power, support insect populations, and maximize benefits for both agriculture and [alternative energy](https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/clean-energy-get-money-back-on-bill-solar-wind-power/) industries, per recent reporting in [CleanTechnica](https://cleantechnica.com/2024/06/08/agrivoltaic-solar-arrays-will-win-the-rural-solar-war-with-insects/). Burning coal, oil, and gas [for power](https://www.clarity.io/blog/a-deep-dive-economic-impacts-of-air-pollution) releases [toxic pollution](https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/short-term-air-pollution-cancer-cardiovascular-disease-study/) into our atmosphere that can cause serious problems for our [health](https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/air-pollution-effects-on-digestive-system-liver-pancreas/), [finances](https://www.clarity.io/blog/a-deep-dive-economic-impacts-of-air-pollution), extreme [weather](https://www.thecooldown.com/outdoors/how-air-pollution-amplifies-heatwave-extremes/), and more. [Solar power](https://www.thecooldown.com/solar-panels/) is a less expensive energy source that turns sunlight into energy without the accompanying [harmful pollution](https://energy.sc.gov/). As the [South Carolina Energy Office](https://energy.sc.gov/) wrote [on its website](https://solar.sc.gov/learn-about-solar/how-solar-works), \"[Solar] energy is free, immune to rising energy prices, and can be used to provide heat, lighting, mechanical power, and electricity.\" But responses aren't always so bright. Successful Farming [reported](https://www.agriculture.com/solar-and-wind-farms-generate-controversy-but-occupy-a-sliver-of-rural-land-8654435) significant setbacks to solar initiatives in rural regions — including adverse reactions from area residents and intense local government restrictions. The revolutionary technique of agrivoltaics, engineered to keep underlying farmland available for use, could change all that. Instead of placing [solar panels](https://www.thecooldown.com/solar-panels/) on [rooftops](https://cleantechnica.com/?s=tina+casey+agrivoltaic), agrivoltaics are strategically situated [on fields](https://cleantechnica.com/?s=tina+casey+agrivoltaic) to create [partial shade](https://cleantechnica.com/2024/06/08/agrivoltaic-solar-arrays-will-win-the-rural-solar-war-with-insects/), retain [soil water](https://cropwatch.unl.edu/2024/soil-water-plant-interaction-basics), and increase crop production. This method means the same land can be used for farming and clean energy generation. Per [CleanTechnica](https://cleantechnica.com/2024/06/08/agrivoltaic-solar-arrays-will-win-the-rural-solar-war-with-insects/): \"Agrivoltaic solar arrays will win the rural solar war.\" Combining the U.S. Department of Agriculture's [Conservation Reserve Program](https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/conservation-programs/conservation-reserve-program/index) with incentives to pursue agrivoltaics would enable farmers to make money, preserve farmland, [protect flora and fauna](https://www.thecooldown.com/green-home/how-to-make-your-yard-a-friendlier-place-for-pollinators/), and prevent pollution, the CleanTechnica report noted. \"Evidence is also accumulating in support of the beneficial impacts on [pollinator](https://www.thecooldown.com/green-home/how-to-make-your-yard-a-friendlier-place-for-pollinators/) habitats and native flora,\" stated CleanTechnica — a high-value proposition considering [worrisome reductions](https://entomology.ucr.edu/news/2023/07/13/researchers-study-global-decline-insect-populations) in the global insect population. Those big wins have agrivoltaics gaining buzz. In June, the [New York State Energy Research and Development Authority](https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/) announced a $5 million program supporting agrivoltaic solar development, as reported by CleanTechnica. \"This initiative seeks to strike a balance between achieving renewable energy targets and supporting the agricultural sector,\" said [New York Ag Connection](https://newyorkagconnection.com/news/new-york-launches-5m-agrivoltaic-program-for-clean-energy), and sets a precedent for other states to potentially follow. Excited about this new frontier? Let that fuel your [exploration](https://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/explore-critical-climate-issues/) into the world of alternative [and more affordable](https://www.thecooldown.com/green-home/hvac-hack-save-money-energy-bill/) energy. Calculate how much you'd save [with solar powe](https://www.thecooldown.com/green-home/solar-panels-value-home-how-much/)r and [install your own panels at home](https://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/install-solar-panels/), learn about [community solar](https://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/sign-up-for-community-solar/) programs, level up [daily life](https://guide.thecooldown.com/journeys/modernize-your-home/) with [cool technology](https://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/upgrade-to-a-natural-lawn/), and preserve [pollinators](https://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/upgrade-to-a-natural-lawn/) in [your own yard](https://guide.thecooldown.com/journeys/upgrade-your-yard/).
