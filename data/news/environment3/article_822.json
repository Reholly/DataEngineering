    "text": "The global geomagnetic storm on May 10 , which brought magnificent displays of green, red, purple and blue aurora to latitudes as far south as Arizona and Florida, could soon be predicted with greater accuracy.\nViolent solar eruptions—called coronal mass ejections—can send clumps of charged particles in Earth’s direction. When they arrive, they create extreme geomagnetic storms , involving strong currents that can potentially damage power transmission lines, oil and gas pipelines, railways and submarine cables. Charged particles accelerate down Earth’s magnetic field to interact with particles in the atmosphere, also causing aurora (called the northern lights in the northern hemisphere).\nHowever, predicting when a geomagnetic storm will begin—and, therefore, when a display of aurora will start—has thus far eluded solar physicists and space weather forecasters.\nAccurate Predictions Researchers at Aberystwyth University presented their new research today at the Royal Astronomical Society's National Astronomy Meeting in Hull . The study says it’s now possible to predict the precise speed at which a CME travels and, therefore, accurately predict when a geomagnetic storm is due to begin.\nMay’s landmark G5 geomagnetic storm—the strongest since 2003—was caused by several CMEs traveling at different speeds that caught up with each other before striking Earth together. However, space weather forecasters were not able to give a precise prediction in advance.\nMORE FOR YOU Exactly When Apple Will Launch iPhone 16 And iPhone 16 Pro Huge Windows Blackout Hits Banks, Airports And More Google Confirms Play Store App Deletion—Now Just 6 Weeks Away Solar Maximum If they occur on the Earth-facing side of the sun and are Earth-directed, CMEs can take a few days to reach Earth. They occur from sunspots on the solar surface, usually in the wake of solar flares, which travel at light speed and can cause a geomagnetic disturbance just eight minutes later.\nAlthough the sun has been quiet for the last few weeks, it has been active for the last year or so, with numerous solar flares and CMEs. That’s because our star is close to, or perhaps already at, “solar maximum,” the peak of an 11-year-long solar cycle that sees a spike in the sun’s magnetic activity.\nActive Regions The research focuses on “Active Regions” of sunspots, which have strong magnetic fields, and which create CMEs. Monitoring how these areas changed before, during and after an eruption, the researchers studied the height at which the magnetic field became unstable and produced a CME. The findings reveal a strong relationship between the critical height as a CME begins and its speed as it leaves the sun, making it possible to predict the arrival of a CME at Earth—even before it has fully erupted from the sun.\n“By measuring how the strength of the magnetic field decreases with height, we can determine this critical height,” said Harshita Gandhi, lead researcher and a solar physicist at Aberystwyth University. After inputting the data into a 3D geometric model, the true speed of CMEs can be tracked, and precise predictions can be made. “This insight allows us to predict the CME’s speed and, consequently, its arrival time on Earth, even before the CME has fully erupted,” said Gandhi.\nPreparing For Aurora Solar physicists are expecting more powerful geomagnetic storms in the coming months. Aurora occurs all the time, usually around the Arctic and Antarctic Circles at around 65 degrees north and south. However, aurora tends to be seen closer to the equator when geomagnetic storms increase and intensify.\nFrequent checking of apps like My Aurora Forecast & Alerts , AuroraWatchUK or the online Aurora - 30 Minute Forecast - Space Weather Prediction Center is recommended. However, to see the aurora at its best, you need proper darkness and a clear sky. It’s wise to be ready to head out very late at night (if you're in the northern hemisphere) to somewhere with as little light pollution as possible. A Dark Sky Place finder will identify the closest Dark Sky Park. Alternatively, use a light pollution map .\nAlthough very colorful auroras are possible—particularly if you're far from light pollution—keep your expectations to “photographic aurora,” which only a smartphone or manual camera can capture to show significant color.\nPick up my books Stargazing in 2024 , A Stargazing Program For Beginners , and When Is The Next Eclipse?\nWishing you clear skies and wide eyes.\nJamie Carter Following",
