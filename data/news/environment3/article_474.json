    "text": "For many Red Lobster customers, looking in the tank for the crustacean that will become your dinner is an exciting part of the experience. Diners at a Colorado Red Lobster location, however, found something quite eye-catching recently.\nWorkers at the Red Lobster in Pueblo, Colorado were recently notified about a different-looking lobster in the tank at the restaurant. It turns out it had a rare, one-in-30 million genetic mutation that gave it a unique orange color.\n\"They’re very dark brown with maybe a few small spots or discoloration points, so having one that was bright orange that none of us had ever seen was definitely a bit of a shock,\" general manager Kendra Kastendieck told KDVR .\nIt wasn't even one of the employees that noticed the off-colored crustacean, but the customers. \"We actually had several guests see him in the tank in our lobby and asked why do we have a cooked lobster in our lobster tank,\" Kastendieck said.\nThe Downtown Aquarium in Denver said the lobster was \"accidentally delivered\" to a Red Lobster in Pueblo. The restaurant's quick thinking saved the lobster's life.\n\"The lobster’s coloration is from a genetic mutation which affects and prevents encoded proteins,\" the aquarium explained to KDVR . \"The lack of one or several proteins can manifest as different colors, including blue, yellow, and orange.\"\nIt's not the first time an orange lobster has been seen. Back in 2018, a Massachusetts grocery store worker found an orange lobster while working at a supermarket.\nAs for this lobster, it's since been re-homed at the aquarium and been named \"Crush\" after the Denver Broncos ' famous defense in the 1970s and '80s.
