    "text": "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (Dakota News Now) - Sioux Falls Animal Control needed the assistance of Sioux Falls Fire Rescue on Thursday to save a pig and the video has gained traction on social media.\nThe pig has been through a lot, but is in good hands after being spotted on the sandbar of the Big Sioux River,\nThe rescue was quick, but now there are more questions to be answered like how and why the pig was there and where it came from.\nJust north of Falls Park, a peculiar scene unfolded as a young livestock pig was spotted not too far from the dangerous rushing water from the falls.\n“We get a lot of different calls, so you never know until you get there, and when I drove up, I saw a little pig running down the sandbar so I knew it was true,” said Sioux Falls Animal Control Supervisor Patty Beckman.\nSioux Falls Fire Rescue assisted Animal Control and shared footage to social media that showed not a wild goose chase, but them chasing the stranded swine.\n“We appreciate the Fire Department so much. They help us out with so much stuff that we have, whether it’s a water rescue or if they have to help us get an animal out of a tree. We appreciate their assistance so much and we value their teamwork with us,” Beckman expressed.\nIt’s rare for Sioux Falls Animal Control to encounter a stray pig, but the circumstances made it an even stranger situation. No one knows why the pig made its way to that sandbar and where it came from is anyone’s guess.\n“At this point in time, we really don’t know where the pig came from. We did get in contact with Smithfield, but they stated that they don’t take pigs that small. So at this point, we really have no clue,” Beckman said.\nDana Konzem with the Sioux Falls Area Humane Society said that she first heard about the situation from the video on Facebook. They knew the pig would arrive soon after.\nHe will be housed at the Humane Society for now, but it’s not normal for them to see a pig, either. Owning a pig as a pet is not allowed within Sioux Falls city limits.\n“It’s pretty rare for a pig to come in as a stray animal, maybe one every five to seven years that we get something like this. Typically if a pig is a stray animal, we know where it came from, someone’s out looking for it,” Konzem said.\nAfter a stressful 24 hours, this mystery pig is resting and receiving the care it needs.\n“It’s just a little bit of a different animal to take care of. Hopefully, we can get it back to its rightful owner or get it into a forever home once its stray wait is up,” Konzem said.\nThe pig, to be named later, will stay at the Humane Society until someone claims him or the 72-hour stray hold period is over. After that, he would be sent to a new, loving home. The Humane Society cannot adopt out a pig, so he will likely go to an animal sanctuary.\nCopyright 2024 Dakota News Now. All rights reserved.",
