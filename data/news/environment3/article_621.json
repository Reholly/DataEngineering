    "text": "On Thursday, the Dak Lak Centre for Elephant Conservation, Animal Rescue and Forest Protection Management co-operated with foreign experts and veterinarians to remove the two injured tusks for the elephant named Gold.\nThe surgery was conducted to remove the elephant's broken tusks on July 18\nEarlier, while playing, the elephant suddenly hit a hard tree trunk, breaking its tusks. The animal was provided with the intensive treatment at the the Dak Lak Centre for Elephant Conservation, Animal Rescue and Forest Protection Management, but the situation did not improve, causing it great pain and loss of appetite as well as weight loss.\nThe centre invited leading global elephant experts and veterinarians to examine the elephant. According to them, Gold's broken tusks could not recover. If not properly treated, this would result in serious impacts on its health.\nThe centre sought approval from concerned authorities for more intensive treatment methods to save the elephant.\nSince April, the elephant has undergone two operations to remove the tusks.\nGold’s health condition has recovered quite well.\nIn March 2016, Gold fell into a well while moving with a herd of wild elephants. The elephant was only a few months old at the time and was taken to Dak Lak Elephant Conservation Centre to be cared for.",
