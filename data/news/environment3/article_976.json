    "text": "ASPiRE: Empowering Future Sustainability Leaders with APRIL Group Jakarta. Sustainability has taken on a crucial role to businesses around the world. Companies are now striving to deliver more positive environmental impacts and forefronting sustainable practices. The demand for sustainability and ESG professionals are continuously increasing. [APRIL Group](https://www.aprilasia.com/en/), one of the most technologically advanced pulp and paper producer, is helping drive the sustainability agenda on a global level. The company launched the APRIL Sustainability Professional Readiness Program (ASPiRE), an accelerated, holistic program geared towards empowering post-graduates to be future leaders in ESG and sustainability. This 18-month program provides candidates access to unparalleled opportunities to take on a wide range of sustainability-related roles in APRIL, focusing on operational/technical areas. These include opportunities in conservation and restoration, community development, R&D, fiber and mill sustainability, as well as supporting corporate roles such as stakeholder engagement, communications, and ESG reporting. Throughout ASPiRE, candidates will be equipped with the knowledge to become future leaders who are able to face global issues in sustainable development. This program does not only provide exposure to the business but also fosters a unique learning experience for personal and professional growth. Every ASPiRE candidate has their own unique journey with the program. Christian Pranoto, part of ASPiRE batch 4, has a story not quite like the other. As a graduate of the University of Edinburgh’s Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, with a mission to protect Indonesian wildlife and advance his sustainability skills, Christian enrolled in the ASPiRE program. Christian took part in APRIL’s restoration project, Restorasi Ekosistem Riau (RER), where he integrated traditional fishing methods to support the economic and social well-being of villagers near the Serkap Village in Riau. This project empowered fishermen to practice sustainable fisheries, with the goal of maintaining healthy fish stocks while sustaining the livelihoods of local communities. Now part of APRIL’s Sustainability team, ASPiRE taught Christian that accomplishing long-term sustainability goals requires strong commitment and consistent action. “I am grateful for the opportunity to explore sustainability through my enrollment in the prestigious ASPiRE Batch 4 to hone my skills and start a rewarding career in sustainability,” said Christian. From the latest ASPiRE batch, Gigih Radiantama, a Humanitarian Engineering graduate from the Warwick School of Engineering, already has his own unique story to share. He worked with the Community Development Department to address extreme poverty in Riau. Gigih helped navigate the complexities by improving strategies to ensure that future initiatives are more impactful. Gigih also implemented a hands-on approach for surveys he conducted in Pelalawan and Siak to understand the perspectives of extremely poor households. He highlighted the mentorship he received from the department head and managers and the collaborative spirit to help achieve the shared goal. A graduate of the National University of Singapore, Ayu Primastuti, another member of ASPiRE batch 4, also shared her fascinating journey in sustainability. She played an integral role in the realization efforts of multiple APRIL2030 commitments through her participation in projects with different departments. Ayu worked with the Human Resources department to roll out APRIL’s gender action plan, aligned with the company’s Inclusive Progress commitment. Currently, Ayu is finalizing her last project related to APRIL’s Sustainable Growth commitment by assessing and identifying opportunities for water conservation and reduction at the mill. “The program truly extends my knowledge of sustainability including the necessary skills for strategic engagement as well as the technical aspects of the work,” Ayu said. ASPiRE is Opening Applications APRIL is now calling applications for a new batch of ASPiRE for recent graduates with the passion to learn and contribute to a greater cause through sustainability. Upon the completion of the program, candidates can look forward to join a community of high-skilled, multi-national sustainability professionals within APRIL. To be considered for the ASPiRE program, applicants must meet the following requirements: - Holds a Master’s degree from international reputable universities - Have an academic background in environmental or social sciences, public policy, business/management, natural resources, or sustainability - Preferably possess a minimum of 2 years of work experience - Strong interest in climate, nature, people, and sustainable growth/circularity - Possess excellent verbal and written English skills If you aspire to start your own journey with sustainability, more information on the ASPiRE program and application process are available on the company [website](https://www.aprilasia.com/en/aspire), or you can visit APRIL Group on Instagram [@discoverapril](about:blank).
