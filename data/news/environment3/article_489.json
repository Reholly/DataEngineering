    "text": "10 hours ago\nLocal, state, and federal leaders joined the James River Association the morning of Wednesday, July 17 to officially open the James A. Buzzard River Education Center.\nThe center has been in the works for several years, as part of JRA’s $25 million James Changer campaign. The organization acquired the .85-acre parcel in 2022 and broke ground in May 2023.\nClasses are already in session. The first group of RPS students saw what the facility has to offer at the beginning of the month.\nAn outdoor classroom at the River Education Center teaches students about fish migration.\nPhoto by RICtoday\nIn the past year, JRA has hosted over 20,000 students for programs along the length of the James. It hopes to expand its reach with the new center.\nThe site includes two lab classroom spaces, a riverquarium, and an outdoor classroom. A river health meter is set up on the front of the building facing Dock Street to alert Richmonders to current river conditions.\nCity Councilmember Cynthia Newbille spoke at the ribbon cutting. She highlighted the benefits for local students, from environmental education to recreational opportunities and river safety.\n“It won’t be a situation where they’re an adult, as I was, before they got out on the river and did a little white water rafting,” Newbille said. “They as youngsters will become educated and engaged with practical applications.”\nSenator Tim Kaine speaks at the opening of the River Education Center.\nPhoto by RICtoday\nJRA leaders highlighted the environmental considerations that went into building the facility, like the implementation of a green roof, living walls, native landscaping, and a permeable bus loop.\nThe construction took place at the same time as the new Dock Street Park , which allowed for the relocation of a stretch of the Virginia Capital Trail away from the street.\nSenator Tim Kaine also spoke at the opening event and emphasized the importance of early education and exposure to the James.\n“If you create passion among young people, then they’ll be stewards for life,” Kaine said.
