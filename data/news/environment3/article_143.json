    "text": "The Gemini solar and storage project, the U.S.’ largest co-located solar plus battery energy storage system (BESS), is now fully operational, Gemini’s developers [Primergy Solar](https://www.hartenergy.com/companies/primergy-solar) and Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners announced July 18. Located in Clark County, Nevada, the project includes 1.8 million solar panels that can generate up to 690 megawatts (MW), powering approximately 10% of the state’s peak power demand. The solar panels are co-located with 380 MW of four-hour battery storage to provide Nevada with 1,400 megawatt-hours of clean energy after sundown, the companies said in its release. Gemini incorporates a DC-coupled storage configuration which enables the BESS to charge directly from the solar panels. This allows for increased efficiency and maximizes the capture and storage of solar energy directly on-site, the release said. In April 2022, Primergy and Quinbrook closed a $1.9 billion debt and equity financing for Gemini’s construction and development. In October 2022, APG, a Netherlands-based pension asset manager, acquired a 49% equity ownership in Gemini on behalf of its pension fund client ABP. In April 2024, the remaining 51% of the project was acquired by the Quinbrook Valley of Fire Fund, with Blackstone Strategic Partners and Ares Management Infrastructure Secondaries funds as lead investors. “Gemini broke the mold with a historic amount of solar and BESS, backed by the largest tax equity financing of its kind,” said Primergy CEO Ty Daul. “Achieving full commercial operations marks a significant technical and financial milestone for our team. We successfully navigated challenging supply chain and inflation issues through proactive planning and collaboration to bring this project online.” Earlier this year, Primergy closed commitments for $588 million in debt financing for the 408 MW alternating current Ash Creek Solar project in Hill County, Texas. The company also signed a long-term power purchase agreement with Microsoft for the full capacity of the plant.
