    "text": "A former Black Panther Party leader is behind a new\naffordable housing project. According to NBC Bay Area, Elaine Brown, a former chairwoman of the Black Panther Party, led efforts to raise $80 million to open a 79-unit apartment complex in Oakland, CA.\nIt took close to 10 years for the project to acquire its\nfunding, and there were initial challenges to secure the land.\n“We have to fight for everything, and this I hope will generate one thing: to fight for what you believe we are deserving of,” Brown said in a press conference.\nThe complex has rightfully been named The Black Panther, and it is located at 1670 Seventh St. Already, 7,500 people have applied to move into the apartments. To qualify, applicants must have a household income that is at 30% or below the area’s median income.\nThe apartment also welcomes formerly incarcerated individuals.\nAs for the amenities and resources offered, the building will include free-wifi, all furnishing for apartments, supportive services, and five\nbusinesses such as an onsite market and restaurant.\n“Now with this opportunity to bring a community food market to this environment, this food desert, it’s unspeakable, and we will not only be able to bring healthy and fresh food for people, we will be able to… employ people,” said Tolani King, co-founder of Moms 4 Housing, in a press conference, per NBC Bay Area.\nThe complex will also include a fitness center, which is being co-developed by Joli Zahra Drevitch.\n“You don’t want to feel like you’re paying California rent to try to take care of yourself, but when you do feel overall healthier you take care of the rest of the community behind you,” she explained.\nFurthermore, the apartment complex is a clean energy building. Its designs are enhanced with green features such as rooftop solar panels, energy-efficient appliances, elevators, and cutting-edge building mechanical systems, which resulted from the design collaboration of local nonprofit Oakland and the World Enterprises (OAW) and community developer McCormack Baron Salazar.\nResidents are expected to move into the establishment beginning in the fall.",
