    "text": "Mandai T15 trail, a.k.a. the Gangsa trail Look beyond the food courts, shopping malls, and buzzy bars in Singapore, and you’ll find scenic lakes, hidden parks, and a whole lot of hiking trails . One of which is the Mandai T15 trail .\nLocated inside the Central Catchment Nature Reserve, this less-trafficked trail stretches 7.1km and is relatively flat, which makes it an easy spot to get your daily green fix without going full-on Into The Wild . Strap on your sturdy shoes and hit the road.\nHike the 7.1km trail around Mandai Lake Clocking in at 7.1km, the richly wooded loop starts on Mandai Lake Road – near the entrance of the Singapore Zoo at Mandai Wildlife Reserve – and takes you to Bukit Panjang Hawker Centre. It’s home to paved paths canopied by large oaks and maples, alongside meadows and wetlands that are pretty photogenic and also kid-friendly.\nImage credit: @kevuzingh via Instagram\nAlong the hike, expect to witness a host of wildlife like long-tail macaques, deers, stingrays, and even snakes. If you’re committed to the full hike, which generally takes around 1.5 hours to complete, make sure you follow the main trail which is marked with signs. The Mandai T15 trail is not dog-friendly so leave your pets at home.\nImage credit: @thevisualhaslanded via Instagram\nThe picturesque path wraps around Mandai Lake and winds through a fallen tree trunk photo spot. Once populated with ‘grammers , this drool-worthy sight has been cordoned off to prevent trekkers from trampling on trees and plants in the area.\nImage credit: @rovinglight via Instagram\nThe Mandai T15 trail is also popular among mountain cyclists, so stay alert. Or, dust off your bike and bring it along to cover more ground and burn more calories. There are a few slightly strenuous slopes along the trail that’ll make cycling fun.\nGet outdoors this weekend at the Mandai T15 trail",
