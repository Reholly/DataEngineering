    "text": "( MENAFN - AzerNews) Ulviyya Shahin Read more\nTo boost global climate action, Mukhtar Babayev, Azerbaijan's Minister of Ecology and Natural Resources and President of the upcoming 29th UN Climate Change conference (COP29), has sent official communications to participating governments. This move, reported by various international outlets, including the UK's Business Green, signifies a renewed effort to secure tangible climate commitments.\nThe COP29 President has confirmed that a pivotal focus during the conference will be reaching a consensus on a new climate financing target. Emphasising the urgency, he urges governments to update their national climate plans to limit global warming to 1.5Â°C. Defining a fresh collective quantified goal for climate finance (NCQG) is set as a primary agenda item under Azerbaijan's presidency.\nThe letters also stress the necessity of agreeing on an ambitious and feasible climate finance target, especially tailored to the needs of developing countries within the Framework Convention.\nAccording to Babayev, achieving consensus on climate finance targets requires collaborative effort among nations. He underscores that this is not solely Azerbaijan's priority but a collective responsibility to achieve this significant milestone.\nFurthermore, Babayev details pre-summit events and meetings leading up to COP29 in Baku, involving ministers from UNFCCC member nations, negotiating groups, and NGOs.\nThe publication highlights the critical steps needed to ensure the operational effectiveness of the Loss and Damage Fund, initiated at COP28 in Dubai last year. This fund aims to aid vulnerable and developing nations in managing climate change impacts.\nThe COP29 President's correspondence coincided with a poignant video message from UNFCCC Executive Secretary Simon Stiell, who, following Hurricane Beryl's devastation of his home island of Carriacou, emphasised the human and economic toll of climate disasters. Stiell called for prioritising climate action to prevent such tragedies from becoming commonplace.\nBusiness Green, a reputable UK publication focusing on environmental issues and the green economy, reported these developments.\nMENAFN19072024000195011045ID1108458136",
