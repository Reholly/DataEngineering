    "text": "•Yvonne Kirigo has been recognized for her leadership in green initiatives at MP Shah Hospital, including e-waste collection, energy efficiency, renewable energy adoption, and water efficiency projects. •Kevin Getobai on the other hand was acknowledged for his work at Ololo Farm, where he integrated regenerative and sustainable agriculture practices. Global Compact Network Kenya has named MP Shah Hospital strategy and innovation manager Yvonne Kirigo and Ololo Farm, project manager Kevin Getobai as the 2024 Country SDG Pioneers. The two were selected from over 27 nominations for their contributions to advancing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Yvonne Kirigo has been recognized for her leadership in green initiatives at MP Shah Hospital, including e-waste collection, energy efficiency, renewable energy adoption, and water efficiency projects. These efforts have significantly reduced the hospital's environmental footprint. Kevin Getobai on the other hand was acknowledged for his work at Ololo Farm, where he integrated regenerative and sustainable agriculture practices. His introduction of Black Soldier Flies for composting has reduced the composting process from six months to 14 days, saving CO2 emissions and producing protein from waste. As a sustainability champion, Ololo Farm is now able to save up to 47.5 tonnes of CO2 equivalence, divert 25 tonnes of food waste from going into landfills, and produce 2.5 tonnes of protein from waste annually. “Their commitment to the Ten Principle of the UN Global Compact exemplifies the spirit of innovation and resilience needed to advance the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Their work will inspire other participants in building a sustainable future for all,” said Global Compact Network Kenya executive director Judy Njino. As national winners, Kirigo and Getobai will compete in the Global round for the title of 2024 UN Global Compact SDG Pioneer. The global winners will be announced in September during the UN Global Compact Leaders' Summit in New York. The SDG Pioneers programme recognizes the dedicated professionals that drive and innovate solutions through new technologies, initiatives and business models that can enable the globe to reach the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. “We hope their work will inspire others to advance the Global Goals by implementing our Ten Principles on human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption,” said Sanda Ojiambo, CEO & Executive Director of the UN Global Compact.",
