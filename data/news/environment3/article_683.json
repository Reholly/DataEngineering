    "text": "With gloves, trash bags, and determination, volunteers of Fourways and Kyalami came together to clean up Winnie Mandela Drive. The event was organised by the Live Life Always Litter Picking Up Foundation, a local initiative that aims to promote environmental sustainability and create employment opportunities.\nThe foundation, founded three years ago, has been making waves in the community with its tireless efforts to keep the area clean. “It’s all about creating a cleaner environment and providing employment opportunities for residents. We believe that by working together, we can make a difference,” said Lovemore Robson, the founder of the foundation.\nRead more: Douglasdale community members accuse the religious group of littering\nLovemore Robson hard at work. In a show of community spirit, the volunteers set out to tackle the task at hand. And before long, the once-littered road was transformed, spotless, with clean pavements.\nBut the foundation’s work doesn’t stop there. They rely on donations to support their activities and provide financial support to their workers. “We need the community’s support to continue our efforts. Without donations, we wouldn’t be able to keep doing what we do,” added Robson.\nAlso read: Pikitup urges residents not to illegally dump bulk waste\nLovemore Robson, the founder of the Live Life Always Litter Picking Up Foundation.
