    "text": "CENTRAL POINT, Ore. -- The Jackson County Fair is on its third day, bringing the rides, food and animals the community has come to know and love.\nWith animals flooding the Jackson County Expo, many wonder where they come from. The answer lies within the community: The local 4-H club.\n4-H teaches local youth how to care for and market different types of animals. The animals at the fair are showcased or sold by participants who have spent the better part of a year raising and taking care of the animals.\n\"I've learned so much, I've learned so many skills,\" Said Isabel Miracle, a 4H club member.\nThe kids who participate in raising and selling their livestock also get to keep the money for themselves, after paying back costs for raising the animal and paying auctioneers.\n\"A lot of people use that either for college, cars or next years project,\" 4H member Jessalyn Magerle said, \"Just getting to their next part in life.\"\nMany see the Jackson County fair and 4H as bringing up the next generation of agriculturists in the Rogue Valley. Bringing more youth into a field that's dwindled with time.\n\"Ag is slowly disappearing in our valley,\" Said Tim Magerle, \"But it's still a vital aspect of this community.\"",
