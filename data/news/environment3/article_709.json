    "text": "SEALNET's 8th Summit Unites Asian Soil Labs for a Sustainable Future\nMedia Release\nICRISAT's Soil Scientist Dr Pushpajeet Choudhari Chairs Asian Soil Laboratory Network's (SEALNET) 8th Meeting\nThe 8th Asian Soil Laboratory Network (SEALNET) meeting, held in the Philippines from 15-19 July, brought together distinguished dignitaries, scientists, and SEALNET members from across the globe. Virtual participants from different geographies also attended the event. ICRISAT Scientist Dr Pushpajeet Lokpal Choudhari, Chair of the Asian Soil Laboratory Network, had the honor of delivering the opening address.\nSEALNET, the first regional network established within Global Soil Laboratory Network (GLOSOLAN), has set a precedent for other regions by grouping soil laboratories into regional networks. The initiative aims to harmonize Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), foster connections among Asian soil laboratories, and advance collective efforts towards sustainable soil health.\nDr Jacqueline d'Arros Hughes, Director General of ICRISAT, commended SEALNET's initiative and their commitment to continue working together, inspiring one another, and making significant strides towards a sustainable and healthy future for our soils.\nCurrently, SEALNET connects approximately 150 registered laboratories, a testament to the commitment of its members and the dedicated efforts of the SEALNET Steering Committee over the years.\nAt the inaugural session held on 15 July 2024, Mr Lionel Henri Valentin Dabbadie, FAO Representative in the Philippines, and Mr Lifeng Li, Director of the FAO Land and Water Division, were the guest speakers. The keynote address was delivered by the Honorable Francisco P Tiu-Laurel Jr., Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, Philippines.\nAfter years of virtual meetings due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this in-person gathering marked a significant opportunity to strengthen relationships among laboratories and countries and to define a sustainable work plan for the coming years.\nAll focal points were called on to encourage regional laboratories to join SEALNET and participate in regional proficiency testing.\n\"By joining this initiative, members will contribute to collective goals and benefit from shared resources, expertise, and collaborative opportunities. Together, we can generate quality data to amplify our impact and drive meaningful change in soil health management,\" said Dr Pushpajeet Choudhari.\nSpecial thanks were extended to the host of this year's meeting, the Bureau of Soil and Water Management of the Philippines, and its Director, Dr Gina P Nilo, for organizing the meeting and her contributions as the former SEALNET Chair. In her address, Dr Nilo stressed the role soil laboratories play in meticulously measuring and providing the vast data required for the preparation of soil health maps.\nDr Stanford Blade, ICRISAT's Deputy Director General-Research, commended SEALNET's extensive efforts and emphasized the importance of soil health monitoring in the context of 'One Health'.\n\"Quality soil data and integrity are key to sustainable soil management and achieving food self-sufficiency. Healthy soil leads to a healthy life, as 95% of our food comes from land. It all begins with soil and water, the sources of life,\" said Dr Blade.\nThe inaugural sessions held on 15 and 16 July were followed by practical sessions on soil analysis and concluded with a field tour on 19 July 2024.",
