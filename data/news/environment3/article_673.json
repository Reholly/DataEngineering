    "text": "In a monumental effort to bolster environmental conservation, the Uttar Pradesh government is gearing up to create history by planting over 36.50 crore saplings across the state on July 20. Under the leadership of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, the ambitious ‘Ped Lagao, Ped Bachao Jan Abhiyan-2024’ will kick off in Akbarnagar, Lucknow, marking a significant step towards a greener future. Responding to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for ‘Ek Ped Maa Ke Naam’, 54.20 crore saplings have been nurtured in nurseries and other facilities. Ministers-in-charge across the state are actively mobilising efforts to ensure the campaign’s success, each overseeing strategic planting initiatives in their respective districts. In preparation for the massive plantation drive, nodal officers have been appointed in every district, tasked with overseeing logistics and ensuring smooth execution. These officers will commence their duties on Friday, conducting final inspections to ensure readiness for the monumental event. On July 20, offices, schools, and institutions statewide will halt regular activities for half a day to participate in the tree planting endeavour. CM Yogi will plant saplings in Akbarnagar, which was cleared of encroachments for the purpose of reviving Kukrail river. Forest Minister Arun Kumar Saxena will also plant saplings in Lucknow.
