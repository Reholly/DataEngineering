    "text": "Allah’s endless bounties [Editorial Desk](https://m.greaterkashmir.com/author/editorial-desk/497) Allah’s endless bounties call for bowing head in reverence, and admiring what nature has provided in the form of human sensibilities, and in the exhibit of laws of nature in how the birds fly, as also in the manner the livestock provide for human comfort: ‘’God has brought you out of mother’s wombs, not knowing anything; and He gave you the hearing, and the eyesight, and the brains; that you may give thanks’’ (16:78) The senses that Allah has endowed human beings with places them in the category of being the supreme creation (Ashraf-ul-Makhloqat) apart from special senses, humans are provided with the power of cognitive thinking. It is the power of cognitive thinking, which makes out good from bad, sacred from profane. The special senses, the cognitive power should lead the human beings to thankfulness to the Creator, the Provider. And, there is enough for registering how the laws of nature operate: ‘’Have you not seen the birds, flying in the midst of sky? None sustains them except God. In this are the signs for the people who believe’’ (16:79) The Ayah Karim points to the outer world, carrying an exhibit how the laws of nature operate in making birds to fly in the midst of sky. In the exhibit are indeed signs for the people who believe, as also in the multiple benefits that livestock provides: ‘’And God has given you in your homes habitat for you, and has provided for you out of hides of livestock portable homes for you, so that you can use them when you travel; and when you camp; and from their wool, and fur, and hair, furnishings and comfort for a while’’ (16:80) The bounties of Allah are indeed endless. Apart from dwellings for rest, tents built of the skin of the cattle are light enough to be carried on journey, and to be pitched at places of halt. The wool, fur and hair provide garments and others means of comfort in common use, such as rugs. There is enough grounding for belief, provided one is inclined to believe, and have faith.",
