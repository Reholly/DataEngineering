    "text": "How farmers keep cattle cool in summer heat HANOVER, KS. - The summer season brings a unique set of challenges for cattle farmers. Hot weather can lead to uncomfortable livestock, something no farmer ever wants. Tim Klipp of Four Streams Dairy in Hanover, KS. says his operation relies on one thing above all else. “You gotta move air, that’s the biggest key,” Klipp said. Klipp and his family have about 100 dairy cows and 50 angus, in the northeastern Kansas town, about 25 miles south of Beatrice. A heat wave with temperatures reaching the upper 90’s baked the region last week. One of the keys to battling it: a new fan system they installed this spring. “They’re VES fans, variable speed, come on at about 67 degrees and as it warms up, they turn faster,” Klipp said. Klipp also utilizes a sprinkler system, right above the cows’ feeding station and the main barn is situated to be fully shaded in the summer, but fully sunned in the winter. With over two months of summer left, another heat wave is likely. Klipp says the importance to keeping his cows cool, all goes back to their health. “It comes to a certain point where they just say ‘I’m done’… They go down on milk, and they can lose calves when it gets too hot, they don’t show heat and just aren’t that healthy,” Klipp said. “Even when the heat breaks, it still affects them the rest of their lactation.” Just as important as it is to take care of cows in the heat, Klipp says it’s equally important to know the signs when one is struggling and showing signs of overheating. “If they’re not eating, standing with their mouths open, tongue out panting like a dog, you have to do something then or just pray for cooler weather.”",
