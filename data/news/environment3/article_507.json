    "title": "Wicklow’s Aldi shoppers returned more than 650,000 items via deposit return scheme last month",
    "text": "June was the most successful month to date for the Deposit Return Scheme (DRS) at Aldi, as shoppers across Ireland collectively returned 16.7 million items. In Wicklow, shoppers returned more than 650,000 items in June, bringing the total number of items returned locally to more than 1.6 million since the launch of the scheme earlier this year. This equates to a total of almost €280,000 in vouchers being issued in Wicklow to date. The top three Aldi stores in Wicklow in terms of returns are Arklow, Bray and Rathnew. The average Aldi store in Wicklow has processed more than 330,000 items since February, worth almost €56,000 in returned deposits. This is well above the national average across all of Aldi’s 161 stores in Ireland, which have handled an average of 264,000 items each since the launch of the scheme, worth almost €45,000 in returned deposits. Aldi DRS units have seen a steady increase in the numbers of items returned since February, as customers become acquainted with the scheme. Under the scheme, empty bottles and cans containers marked with the re-turn logo can be returned to the reverse vending machine at all participating retailers, regardless of where the item was originally purchased. Customers receive a voucher for their returned items, which can be used to reduce their shopping bill or returned in cash. Jason Carolan, Plastics and Packaging Manager at Aldi Ireland, commented: “As we can see from the figures today, the DRS scheme has been very popular with Aldi shoppers, and since going live in February of this year, the number of items being returned on a monthly basis has steadily increased. “Customers have redeemed more than €7 million in cash and vouchers at Aldi’s 161 stores, ensuring that more than 42 million items have been returned for recycling through the scheme. We’re proud to play our part in supporting and operating this scheme, which is a key part of helping to ensure more sustainable and circular economic activity. “We’re sure that it will continue to grow from strength to strength, and we’re excited to see the innovative ways that sports clubs and charitable organisations look to harness its potential.” The scheme aims to reduce the amount of litter across Irish towns, villages and countryside, by incentivising consumers to recycle their empty items. Prior to the introduction of the DRS, Ireland had one of the lowest rates of recycling of PET and aluminium drinks bottles and cans, with approximately only 60pc of all drinks containers being recycled. Similar schemes across Europe have been successful in increasing this number in line with the EU target of 77pc of all drinks containers to be recycled by 2025.
