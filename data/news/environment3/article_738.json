    "text": "[Listen](#) PORTO ALEGRE, Brazil — In April, the state of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil experienced its worst floods in 80 years, causing unprecedented destruction and significantly impacting the economy and public safety. The immediate provision of goods and services, supported by the government, civil society organizations, faith communities, and countless volunteers, became a lifeline for many. Amid this collective response, villages and neighborhoods in affected areas where Bahá’í community-building endeavors had taken root quickly discovered how the qualities and capacities for fostering strong bonds of friendship, a spirit of devotion, and a sense of oneness in periods of calm could be channeled into coordinated relief actions during the crisis, extending beyond material aid to help people remain hopeful, persevere, and recover. Liese von Czékus Cavalcanti, a member of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of Brazil, noted, “The difficulties caused by the floods did not obscure the joy that comes from serving one’s fellow human beings. “This joy reflects a deeply rooted concern for the well-being of others and an unwavering faith in the power of the human spirit to transform distress into hope.” This power was channeled into action through the determination and resourcefulness of groups of families who were vital to the recovery efforts. Mrs. Cavalcanti highlighted that the spiritual principle of consultation was essential to these efforts, stating, “Consultation allowed us to bring together diverse perspectives and make unified collective decisions.” In these communities, where consultation is a lived principle, families had gained experience in welcoming many people into thoughtful discussions on collective development, drawing on the perspectives of young and old, women and men, and people of all backgrounds. During the crisis, these capacities allowed entire communities to understand their reality better, communicate effectively, resolve issues, achieve a sense of ownership, and tackle challenges efficiently. These groups of families acted as vital links, distributing food, water, blankets, and other necessities. Many people volunteered in temporary shelters, preparing meals, sorting donated clothes, and assembling hygiene kits. Among those at the forefront of these efforts were the youth, whose keen sense of justice had been nurtured through Bahá’í moral educational programs. They worked tirelessly to bring relief to neighboring communities facing tremendously difficult conditions, as heavy flooding had overwhelmed much of the infrastructure. The elderly also played a significant part, regularly visiting isolated individuals to offer company and comfort. These efforts were facilitated by ad-hoc networks comprising families, Bahá’í Local Spiritual Assemblies, and other Bahá’í agencies at the local and regional levels. These networks included a sub-network of doctors who, in collaboration with national private sector organizations, provided some 5,000 online medical consultations. As part of ongoing development efforts, the Bahá’í National Spiritual Assembly of Brazil is exploring ways to support local Bahá’í agencies in strengthening community resilience. One initiative in Rio Grande do Sul is focused on health promotion, particularly the prevention and treatment of secondary diseases caused by water contamination. A health team has been assembled to train individuals to serve as key resources for disseminating crucial information on disease prevention and promoting overall well-being. Reflecting on the response to the crisis, Mrs. Cavalcanti states, “These tireless efforts were driven by love and a vision of the oneness of the human family inspired by the Bahá’í teachings.” She added: “Countless people left their homes each morning, cars filled with relief items, hearts filled with love. While resources were vital, it was hope expressed through unity and service that truly sustained them.”",
