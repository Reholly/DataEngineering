    "text": "As the world grapples with the need to combat climate change, green energy has become a pivotal area of focus. India, with its vast population and burgeoning economy, stands at a critical juncture as our energy consumption patterns evolve, with a noticeable shift towards renewable sources. Today, India's green energy sector is at a nascent stage but poised for exponential growth. The expectation from the upcoming Budget is high as stakeholders anticipate strategic initiatives from the Indian government to accelerate this transition.India's commitment to green energy sector is evident from its ambitious target of achieving 175 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2022, and the more recent goal of achieving 500 GW by 2030. Renewable energy accounts for over 42% of the country's installed power capacity at present with solar and wind energy with the largest share in the green energy mix. However, to sustain this momentum and meet future requirements, a robust policy framework and financial support are imperative.India is the third-largest energy consumer globally and the fourth-largest in renewable energy installed capacity. Many countries are taking aggressive steps to promote green energy. For instance, the US offers tax credits for renewable energy investments, and China has a comprehensive system of subsidies and quotas. In comparison, India's green energy incentives are modest. However, the country's vast market potential and strategic initiatives like the International Solar Alliance (ISA) position it as a significant player in the global arena.Green financing, which helps in aligning financial investments with environmentally friendly projects, has emerged as a crucial factor in enhancing the scope of green energy in India. The issuance of green bonds has been on the rise, with the government and private entities leveraging them to fund environmentally sustainable projects. In FY24, sovereign green bonds of Rs 20,000 crore were issued as against Rs 16,000 crore in FY23. Moreover, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has included renewable energy under priority sector lending, making it easier for businesses to access finance for green projects. The expectation is that Budget 2024 will support these initiatives further by providing additional incentives for green financing.The upcoming Budget is also expected to address several other key areas to bolster green energy growth. Of primary importance is the need to enhance the allocation of funds towards R&D in renewable technologies. Innovation in storage solutions, such as batteries and pumped storage, is particularly crucial to manage the intermittent nature of solar and wind energy. Incentives in forms of Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for such storage solutions will enhance development in the sector.Apart from storage solutions, sharper focus is needed on scaling up the manufacturing capacity for renewable energy equipment within the country. The PLI scheme plays a vital role here too as it incentivizes domestic manufacturing of solar PV modules and has the potential to make India a global hub for renewable energy production. There are expectations of a similar thrust to the bio energy sector, which also holds huge potential in India.Tax incentives are powerful tools to encourage investment in green energy. Expectations are, therefore, high for the government to introduce or enhance tax benefits for producers of renewable energy. The concessional income-tax of 15%, currently under sunset date, should be extended. Additionally, investment-linked tax deductions or accelerated depreciation for development of green energy projects and exemption of income from green bonds could be considered.It is anticipated that rationalisation of rates from GST perspective on renewable energy equipment and services will be announced. Currently, solar modules attract 12% GST, while services related to installation of solar power plants are taxed at 18%. A uniform lower rate would reduce the overall cost of green energy projects. Alternatively, roll-back of GST rate of 5% on solar equipment will assist in reducing project costs significantly.Budget 2024 is highly anticipated as it can catalyse the country's green energy aspirations. By addressing the financial, regulatory, and policy frameworks, it can lay a solid foundation for sustainable growth. Tax incentives, PLI scheme, and developments in green financing are all critical components that need to be strategically enhanced. As India charts its path towards a greener future, the actions taken today will determine the countryâ€™s role in the global energy landscape and its success in achieving a sustainable and prosperous economy.(Neetu Vinayek, Tax Leader - Oil & Gas, EY India)",
