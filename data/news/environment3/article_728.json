    "text": "Collaboration with Karang Taruna Gemilang, PT Timah Plants 2500 Mangrove Trees on Nyiur Melambai Beach 19 July 2024 SHARE EAST BELITUNG - Mangroves play an important role in protecting coastal ecosystems, for this reason, PT Timah consistently preserves and plants mangroves in the company's operational areas.\nPlanting mangroves is also the company's effort to support the government's program towards Net Zero Emission.\nIn collaboration with Karang Taruna Gemilang, Lalang Village, East Belitung Regency, PT Timah planted 2500 mangrove trees in the Nyiur Melambai Beach Area, Lalang Village, Manggar District, East Belitung Regency, Thursday (18/07/2024).\nChairman of Karang Taruna Gemilang, Apriadi Nur Putra\ngrateful that this planting activity was carried out because this activity is one of the work programs of Karang Taruna Gemilang.\nThis mangrove planting also involves youth organizations in East Belitung.\n\"Today we are carrying out mangrove planting activities, and thank God the support from PT Timah is extraordinary in this activity. \"Apart from that, this is also a program from Karang Taruna,\" he said.\nThe man who is often called Apri said that the aim of planting mangroves was to maintain the ecosystem in the Nyiur Melambai Beach environment.\nThis mangrove planting is also an effort to educate young people's love for the environment, especially protecting the mangrove ecosystem.\n\"In today's activity, we planted 2500 mangrove trees, involving Karang Taruna, Village Government, Regency Government, OPD and friends from Scouts,\" he said.\nIn the future, he hopes that the collaboration with PT Timah can continue because this mangrove planting area will be used as a location for small crab cultivation. So it can have an economic impact on society.\nMeanwhile, the Head of the East Belitung Environmental Service, Novis Ezuar appreciated the activities carried out by Karang Taruna Gemilang together with PT Timah Tbk.\nAccording to him, activities like this show that young people care about the environment.\n\"This activity also has a lot of communities and youth organizations involved, this shows that their concern for the environment has been ingrained from an early age, and this makes them play an active role in the future,\" said Novis.\nAccording to him, PT Timah Tbk plays a very important role in supporting environmental management activities.\n\"So far, PT Timah's relationship with DLH itself has been quite good, especially PT Timah's activities in reclaiming ex-mining land, apart from that, PT Timah's social responsibility towards the environment is also very good,\" he said.\nAccording to him, PT Timah has often been involved in tree planting activities not only in this place but also at several points in other areas.\n\"PT Timah is the largest BUMN in Bangka Belitung, so we hope that PT Timah can continue to play an active role in protecting the environment because with PT Timah's activities exploiting the environment, PT Timah also has a balance in protecting the environment,\" he said.
