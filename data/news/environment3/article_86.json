    "text": "Gently used for less than a dollar: teacher sale at MSU Surplus Store ‘We’d rather reuse things before they get recycled, and this is another way to do that’ EAST LANSING, Mich. (WILX) - “Teachers... how hard they work, and how much they spend of their own money. We just really want to help,” said James Ives, the Sales Manager at the Michigan State University Surplus Store and Recycling Center. There’s a unique sale taking place at the MSU Surplus store on July 19th from 8am to to 3:30pm, designed with teachers in mind. Breathing new life into gently used items, to ease educator’s financial burden. The cost of having a classroom can send teachers to second jobs or even the food bank. According to a 2019 report from the Economic Policy Institute, California and Michigan lead the nation in un-reimbursed teacher spending. That number is $628 per year out of Michigan teachers pockets. The average is $459, adjusted to 2018 dollars. As we know inflation is rising, as are the costs of classroom supplies. Some teachers are relying on wish lists and even crowd-funding, to get what they need for their students. “So we get materials throughout the year, and we have quite a bit, to try to give back to the community for our teachers,” said Ives. Pencils, pens, highlighters and books... all for as little as 25 cents. “We got some good classic children’s books, some good movies I remember watching when I was in school when I was younger. So, it’s kinda cool to see all the things that I experienced when I was younger, now going to all these other classrooms,” said Aidan Menzies, a Student Employee at the store. The items come from all over campus, and community drop offs. If you’ve got items you think could be donated, they say you can call ahead to double check. “A big part of our mission is reuse and recycling. We’d rather reuse things before they get recycled, and this is another way to do that,” said Ives. The store even has a free section, filled with lots of chairs and binders for no cost. They say it’s a pretty popular sale... with hand sanitizer for 25 cents, and decor, craft supplies, and notebooks all for less than a dollar. “To try and give back, and just give to the teachers who do a lot to support everyone’s education. Help make the classroom a better place,” said Menzies. As part of the sale, five mystery bags will be raffled off hourly, free for teachers to enter. With so much costing so little, they ask for patience as it may get crowded. “We’ll have people out there directing traffic, but expect to have some fun. Then whatever’s left, we’re gonna continue that on to the following Wednesday,” said Ives. In 2022, the Internal Revenue Service increased the deduction limit for school supplies. Teachers are able to write off up to $300 in out of pocket classroom expenses on their taxes. That limit was set to increase in $50 increments based on inflation adjustments.
