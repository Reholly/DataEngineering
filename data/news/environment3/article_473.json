    "text": "AUSTIN, Texas â€” Allegiant Air has announced the closure of its crew and aircraft base at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport (AUS), citing airport constraints following the planned closure of the South Terminal as the primary reason for adjustments in its base operations. \"Austin is an important city in our network, and we remain committed to serving our passengers with nonstop flights from AUS,\" stated Allegiant Air officials. \"However, due to constraints arising from the planned closure of the [South Terminal](https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/abias-south-terminal-lawsuit-settled-city-of-austin-takes-control), Allegiant will cease base operations at AUS effective January 7, 2025.\" The airline's decision to shutter its AUS crew and aircraft base does not signify a departure from the Austin market. Instead, Allegiant remains committed to maintaining its numerous nonstop flights from AUS, which are valued by local travelers for their convenience and affordability. Allegiant's flights will continue to operate from the South Terminal of AUS until they are eventually transitioned to the Barbara Jordan Terminal as part of ongoing airport expansion plans. This transition underscores Allegiant's dedication to serving Austin passengers while adapting to infrastructure improvements at the airport. [ALSO| ATX city council passes resolution requiring safety barriers at medical facilities](https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/atx-city-council-passes-resolution-requiring-safety-barriers-at-medical-facilities) \"We appreciate the important value Allegiant Air brings to Central Texas travelers with their nonstop flight offerings,\" stated airport officials. \"Our focus remains on providing a safe, comfortable, and authentically Austin experience for all AUS customers, regardless of their airline choice.\" As a consequence of the base closure, Allegiant will discontinue several routes originating from Austin. These routes include service to Santa Ana (SNA), Eugene (EUG), Bozeman (BZN), Sioux Falls (FSD), Omaha (OMA), Louisville (SDF), and Washington Dulles (IAD). The closure of Allegiant's AUS crew and aircraft base highlights the airline's strategic adjustments amidst broader industry dynamics and AUS's ongoing expansion initiatives. The airport continues to collaborate with airlines to enhance service offerings and passenger experiences. For travelers with upcoming Allegiant flights or inquiries regarding affected routes, Allegiant Air recommends contacting their customer service directly. For further updates and information regarding Allegiant Air's flight schedules and affected routes at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport, travelers are encouraged to visit Allegiant Air's official website or contact customer service directly.",
