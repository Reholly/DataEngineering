    "text": "The City of Eugene Sustainability program has released the Climate Action Plan 2.0 2023 annual report, which indicates the plan is 61% implemented just four years after being created. The annual report shares highlights in five different areas: transportation, buildings, waste, consumption and resilience.\nA decade ago, Eugene was one of the first cities in the nation to establish goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions through the passage of the Climate Recovery Ordinance. In 2020, Eugene continued to lead the way on climate through the development of the Climate Action Plan 2.0.\n“This report highlights the tremendous amount of work being done by the City and our partners to address climate change,” said Danielle Klinkebiel, a climate policy analyst in the Sustainability program. “While there is still much work to do, it is both promising and hopeful to recognize the crucial steps we’ve already taken as a community.”\nSeveral big indicators of progress include construction of a digester at the wastewater treatment facility that transforms methane from solid waste into renewable natural gas; the completion of protected bikeways on 13th Avenue and High Street; and an electric vehicle carshare pilot program at an affordable housing complex.\nEugene’s leadership on climate action is strengthened by groundbreaking investments offered through the federal Inflation Reduction Act and Oregon’s Climate Resilience Package. The City has succeeded in receiving multiple grants to accelerate climate work and is poised to take advantage of many more funding streams.\nThe City also partners with many local organizations when addressing climate work, and their assistance is appreciated.",
