    "text": "Gallego Highlights Support for Yavapai-Apache Nation Water Rights Settlement PHOENIX – Today, Rep. Ruben Gallego (AZ-03), a senior member of the House Natural Resources Committee, released the following statement highlighting his support for the bipartisan, bicameral Yavapai-Apache Nation Water Rights Settlement Act. “As a member of the Water, Wildlife, and Fisheries Subcommittee and former Chair of the Subcommittee for Indigenous Peoples, securing tribal water rights has long been one of my top priorities,” said Rep. Gallego. “I’m proud to back this bipartisan legislation which will not only secure the Yavapai-Apache Nation’s water future but will also protect the flow of the Verde River and benefit the surrounding community.” The Yavapai-Apache Nation Water Rights Settlement Act would ratify and fund the Yavapai-Apache Nation Water Rights Settlement Agreement that will resolve the Nation’s water rights claims, bring additional water supplies to the Verde Valley, and help keep the Verde River flowing. The Yavapai-Apache Nation Water Rights Settlement Act authorizes $1.039 billion to build and maintain essential water infrastructure, including the Cragin-Verde Pipeline and a Surface Water Drinking Plant. The settlement will provide the Yavapai-Apache Nation with confirmed rights to 4,610 acre-feet per year of water, promote water conservation, and protect the flow of the Verde River. Additionally, it includes a land exchange with the Forest Service to secure lands contiguous to the Middle Verde Reservation, enhancing community resilience and environmental stewardship. Today’s statement comes after Rep. Gallego touted his support for the bipartisan, bicameral Northeastern Arizona Indian Water Rights Settlement Act of 2024 yesterday.",
