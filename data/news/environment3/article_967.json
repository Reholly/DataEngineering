    "text": "Engineers say new technology in lithium-sulfur batteries can now charge them in less than five minutes instead of hours.\nLithium-sulfur batteries are one of the few technologies that will be used by most consumers in the future Electric cars can replace the lithium-ion batteries used in These batteries are capable of storing more energy and the use of sulfur means that the materials needed to make them are easier and cheaper to find.\nBut they also face several problems, including the fact that it Batteries Fails to maintain charge and takes a long time to charge. Backup charging sometimes takes up to 10 hours as a result of which it is yet to be mass marketed.\nHowever, new research offers a solution to the charging timing problem, allowing them to charge much faster. Using a new type of catalyst made of carbon materials and cobalt-zinc clusters, researchers have been able to create a large-scale power-storage battery that can be charged in less than five minutes.\n“Our breakthrough has the potential to revolutionize energy storage technologies and advance the development of high-performance battery systems for a variety of applications,” said Shizhang Chiao, who led the research and is associated with the University of Adelaide in Australia. .’\nThis section contains related reference points (Related Nodes field).\nThe team says this is the first comprehensive attempt to fix the slow charging and discharging rates of lithium-sulfur batteries.\nThe researchers hope this could be the start of a range of new applications, including both consumer electronics and energy storage for the grid.\nThe announcement came as Anglo-Australian battery company Galion said preliminary results showed its plans for lithium-sulfur batteries were coming to fruition.\nThe company plans to use these batteries in products that include electric aircraft that can take off and land vertically, as well as The drone And will be used in more conventional electric vehicles.\n“There is strong recognition of the expected importance of lithium-sulfur technology in the energy transition and the expected commercial scale of the market,” said Galleon’s chief executive. Most anticipated applications of the technology will favor batteries where weight and safety are important.’\nHe added that the potential of lithium-sulfur has been known for a long time, but achieving the performance benefits of these batteries is not easy.\nJoin Independent Urdu’s WhatsApp channel for authentic news and current affairs analysis Click here.\n#stateoftheart #battery #charged #minutes\n2024-07-19 05:58:56",
