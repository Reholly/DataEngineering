Listen to Story In Short - Curiosity has been exploring a sulfate-rich region of Mars - The sulfur crystals were found in the Gediz Vallis channel - This discovery has important implications for understanding Mars' geology Nasa's Curiosity rover has made a groundbreaking discovery on Mars, uncovering rocks composed of a mysterious crystals. These crystals, analysis reveled, are pure sulfur - a [first of its kind discovery on the Red Planet. ](https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/new-study-adds-twist-to-martian-story-it-could-have-been-a-cold-frigid-world-2565200-2024-07-11) On May 30, 2024, the rover inadvertently cracked open a rock, revealing vibrant yellow sulfur crystals that have never been observed on Mars before. Since October 2023, Curiosity has been exploring a sulfate-rich region of Mars. While sulfates have been previously detected, they were always found as part of sulfur-based minerals. This recent discovery marks the first time elemental, or pure, sulfur has been identified on the planet. Ashwin Vasavada, Curiosity's project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, likened the discovery to \"finding an oasis in the desert,\" emphasizing its unexpected nature and the need for further explanation. The sulfur crystals were found in the Gediz Vallis channel, an area of significant geological interest on Mount Sharp. Scientists believe this channel was formed by ancient water flows and debris, providing valuable insights into [ Mars' past environmental conditions.](https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/when-a-bouncing-spacecraft-came-hurtling-down-on-mars-in-july-1997-2563873-2024-07-08) This discovery has important implications for understanding Mars' geological history and potential for supporting life. While sulfur itself is not direct evidence of life, its presence can offer clues about past environmental conditions that might have been conducive to microbial life. The Curiosity rover has been exploring Mount Sharp for over seven years, studying its layers to understand when and where Mars might have had conditions suitable for microbial life. The recent findings in the Gediz Vallis channel suggest a complex history [involving both water flows and landslides.](https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/why-nasa-sent-four-people-on-a-year-long-mission-to-artificial-mars-2563643-2024-07-08) On June 18, Curiosity drilled its 41st hole in a nearby rock nicknamed \"Mammoth Lakes.\" The powderized samples collected are being analyzed to determine their composition, potentially offering more insights into Mars' puzzling geological past. As Curiosity continues its exploration, each new discovery brings us closer to [unraveling the mysteries of the Red Planet](https://www.indiatoday.in/visualstories/science/why-is-mars-red-the-answer-lies-in-hidden-rust-149442-05-07-2024) and answering the fundamental question of whether Mars ever harbored life.",
