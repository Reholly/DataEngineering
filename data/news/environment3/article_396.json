    "text": "HOUSTON â€” Have you been traumatized by natural disasters? It could be weather-related PTSD. From Harvey, to the derecho to Beryl, the Houston area has been through tough times in recent years and recent weeks, leaving some to deal with weather-related PTSD. Storms can cause trauma for kids, too. &quot;A lot of kids may still be processing and trying to figure out what happened and also be concerned about what future storms may bring,&quot; Dr. Leslie K. Taylor said. Taylor is a child and adolescent psychologist with UT Physicians. &quot;So, it&#039;s really important to be honest with kids about storms and prepare them for next steps,&quot; she said. There are things you can do to keep your kids from being so anxious when storms are brewing in the Gulf. &quot;Talking to them about feelings, being curious with them about the feelings if they&#039;re feeling scared about what happened or what could happen again. And talk to them about how we&#039;re going to be prepared next time,&quot; Taylor said. There are things parents can do to lower their stress levels. &quot;Preparation can be really helpful, so let&#039;s come up with a list of things that are fun, games that we can play, things that we could do if we don&#039;t have power. Everyone is used to tablets in the digital world, so let&#039;s do puzzles, get Playdoh, do a puppet show,&quot; Taylor said. Some kids are more susceptible to weather-related PTSD than others. &quot;If there&#039;s been a lot of moves, job loss, any other disruption in the family unit, they can be more vulnerable to developing these symptoms,&quot; Taylor said. Sometimes, a professional needs to get involved. If your child keeps having nightmares about storms, can&#039;t stop talking about them, keeps making drawings about them, or is really worried about what&#039;s going to happen for weeks on end, you might want to reach out to their pediatrician to get a mental health referral for them.",
