The presence of the whale was promptly reported, although the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has not yet issued a response regarding the removal or retrieval of the animal to shore.\nThere has been a noticeable increase in the number of dead whales and dolphins found along the New Jersey coastline since 2023. This phenomenon has raised concerns among wildlife experts and local communities about the health of marine life in the region.\nThe data indicates a significant rise in mortality rates among these marine mammals, which has prompted investigations by environmental and marine biology experts. The cause of these deaths is currently under extensive study, with several potential factors being considered.\nWhile some believe it is being caused by underground sonar and explosive testing of the sea bed for the impending off-shore wind farms in New Jersey, public officials at the state and federal level dismiss those claims as a conspiracy theory.\nAccording to Save the Dolphins and Whales, NJ, three dolphins have been found deceased in recent days.\nBottlenose Dolphin - Middle Township, Juvenile, 6/14/24. Moderately decomposed when found.\nCommon Dolphin - Ocean City, Juvenile, 6/14/24. Severely decomposed when found.\nBottlenose Dolphin - Cape May, Juvenile male, 6/13/24.
