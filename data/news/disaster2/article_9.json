    "text": "DANIEL ISLAND, S.C. (WCBD)- Berkeley County has opened a new heliport on Daniel Island that officials say will help lower emergency response times. The helicopter landing pad near the off-ramp of I-526 and Seven Farms Drive can be used to airlift patients experiencing medical emergencies, such as a stroke, to area hospitals in less than seven minutes. “It is incredibly comforting to know that this Unit can be activated and to Daniel Island from its base in 3-5 minutes,” Councilman Josh Whitley said. “The helicopter can literally get the call while the ambulance is at the scene and be waiting on the ambulance at the pad in a minimal and effective response time. I hope we never need the pad, but I am grateful we have it.” The project is part of a larger effort to improve response times, especially during high traffic congestion or when the Wando or Don Holt bridges are shut down. “Emergency response time can mean the difference between life and death,” said Berkeley County EMS Chief Michael Shirey. “Having a faster and guaranteed way to transport critical care patients off the island is further proof that Emergency Medical Services in Berkeley County is meeting the needs of our growing population.” It will be used by Meducare’s dual-engine EC-145 helicopter, which officials said is “considered one of the biggest helicopters in civilian helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS),” allowing crews to transport multiple patients and equipment simultaneously. The helipad cost just over $55,000 to construct with funding from the county’s economic development fund and accommodations feed fund. County council approved funding for two additional helipads, which could be built next year.",
