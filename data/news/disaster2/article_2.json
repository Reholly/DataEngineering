    "text": "Michael Strahan’s daughter, 19, rings the bell after finishing chemo for brain tumor DURHAM, N.C. (Gray News) – Michael Strahan’s daughter Bella rang the hospital bell after finishing chemo treatment for her brain tumor. In [an Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8R-sJDxREE/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading) Sunday, the “Good Morning America” co-host congratulated his 19-year-old daughter on finishing her treatment. “ [@isabellastrahan](https://www.instagram.com/isabellastrahan/) you are a SUPERWOMAN! Ringing that bell, finishing chemo and on your way!” Strahan wrote, in part. “You continue to fight with a smile on your face, strength, and determination. I am one proud Dad!” Bella rang the bell surrounded by friends and family at Duke Children’s Hospital & Health Center in Durham, North Carolina. Her twin sister Sophia was also there to cheer her on. Bella shared her own [social media post](https://www.instagram.com/p/C8Nc7BJugnr/?img_index=2) as well about the milestone, writing, “After the wildest 8 months, I finally got to ring the bell. Grateful for my journey.” The 19-year-old was diagnosed with a large medulloblastoma, a type of malignant tumor, in her cerebellum in October 2023. Since her diagnosis, Bella has gone through six weeks of radiation, four rounds of chemotherapy and three brain surgeries, according to [People](https://people.com/michael-strahan-calls-daughter-isabella-superwoman-after-finishing-chemo-8666296).
