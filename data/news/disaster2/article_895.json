I would like to warmly thank the generous donors who contributed their Adahi through QRCS.”\nInternationally, Adahi Project was implemented in 15 countries across Asia and Africa, in coordination with the host national societies.\nIn cooperation with Pakistan Red Crescent Society (PRCS), sacrificial goats were distributed to 80 families, or 560 beneficiaries, in eight flood-affected provinces, including Sindh, Punjab, and Balochistan. QRCS's representation office distributed 40 cows to 1,200 families, or 8,400 people, in four locations of Kabul, Afghanistan.\nQRCS's representation office of QRCS worked with Jordan National Red Crescent Society (JNRCS) to distribute 250 parcels of sacrificial meat to 1,250 beneficiaries from Syrian refugees and local host community across the country.\nAs part of the ongoing relief support for Gaza, QRCS's office in Jordan worked with Jordan Hashemite Charity Organization (JHCO) to slaughter 4,400 sacrificial animals as phase 1 and get their meat canned, to be trucked into Gaza via humanitarian aid convoys. Totaling 100 tons, with a shelf life of one year, the canned meat will be distributed to over 26,400 beneficiaries. QRCS's office in Sudan distributed the meat of 134 cows, or 938 sacrificial meat parcels, to 2,700 displaced families at shelter centers in Red Sea and Kassala States. The distributions covered some disability care centers in Port Sudan, to share the joy of Eid with the inmates.\nQRCS's representation office distributed the meat of 1,725 heads of sacrificial sheep to 6,900 families at internally displaced people (IDP) camps, including 4,500 families in Mogadishu (Banadir) and 2,400 families in Kismayo (Jubaland).\nFor the benefit of 32,760 people, QRCS's representation office concluded Adahi Project, with the number of sacrificial animals increased to 468 cows, or 3,276 sacrificial meat parcels.\nIn cooperation with Bangladesh Red Crescent Society (BDRCS), QRCS's representation office distributed the meat of 60 cows to 4,400 displaced families, or 22,000 beneficiaries, in several flood-affected provinces.\nIn cooperation with Red Crescent Society of Djibouti, sacrificial animal meat was distributed to 1,588 families, or 9,528 beneficiaries, in Arta, Dikhil, Yoboki, Tadjourah & Obock Districts.
