Why not? pic.twitter.com/DfjjRtZNwE\n— Springbok Sevens (@Blitzboks) June 23, 2024 “We got ourselves into the mess of having to qualify via repechage, but credit to the way the players responded. We came here knowing defence would be the key to success and only conceded three tries in six matches. The guys deserve a lot of credit.\n“We were down and out but credit to the guys. They deserve this and I am pleased we will be going to Paris.”\nOn Sunday, the Blitzboks outplayed Uganda, Canada and Great Britain to claim the final ticket to the Rugby Sevens at the Paris Summer Olympics, which runs from July 26 to August 11.\nWhat a season.... pic.twitter.com/04FzOopsdB\n— Springbok Sevens (@Blitzboks) June 23, 2024 Team captain Selvyn Davids praised his troops and the team's management for a job well done.\n“The guys wanted this. We came here well prepared, with good confidence and a solid game plan. Credit to our opponents, especially Great Britain, who gave us a hard time in the final,” Davids said.\n“We knew it would be a tough weekend but the way we responded to everything our opponents threw at us makes me a proud Blitzboks captain.”\nWorld Rugby also announced the pools for the Rugby Sevens event in Paris.\nSouth Africa, Ireland, New Zealand and Japan will contest Pool A, while Argentina, Australia, Samoa and Kenya are in Pool B. Hosts France will face defending champions Fiji, the US and Uruguay in Pool C.",
