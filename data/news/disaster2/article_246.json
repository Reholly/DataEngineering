    "text": "Firefighters are steadily gaining the upper hand on\nthe massive Post fire in the Gorman area north of Los Angeles, increasing containment from 57% to 61% Friday, prompting officials to lift or reduce some evacuation orders.\nThe burn area remained at 15,690 acres after increasing from 15,611 acres on Tuesday, according to Cal Fire.\nIn anticipation of hot and breezy conditions Friday and through the weekend, firefighters continue to focus on protecting critical infrastructure and recreation areas throughout the fire footprint.\nCrews will continue to identify and address pockets of fire and heat within interior portions of the burned area, as well as along roads and the Interstate 5 corridor, according to Cal Fire.\nThe priority remains constructing and reinforcing containment lines around the fire.\nFire crews have also made progress on suppression repair, including repairing dozer lines and constructing water bars to help protect watersheds and recreation areas.\nSeasonably hot and dry weather is expected Friday, with daytime temperatures in the 90s and humidity levels in the teens and single digits. Morning and evening winds are expected at lower elevations and in valleys.\nFirefighters continue to prepare for a significant warming trend this weekend, with temperatures expected in the high 90s to around 100 degrees. On Sunday there is a slight possibility of thunderstorms over the burn area.\nThe fire broke out Saturday, June 15, prompting the evacuation of about 1,200 people from the Hungry Valley State Vehicular Recreation Area. Evacuation orders remained in place there Wednesday, and also at Pyramid Lake and Oak Flats Campground.\nAs of 10 a.m. Thursday, evacuation orders remained in place for areas south of Gorman Post Road, west of Interstate 5, east of the Los Angeles County line and north of Pyramid Lake, officials said.\nAlso as of 10 a.m. Thursday, evacuation orders were lifted for Cas Paradise Ranch and Goldenstate B. An evacuation order was converted to an evacuation warning for areas south of Pyramid Lake, west of Interstate 5, east of the Los Angeles County line, and just north of Templin Highway.\nThe following road closures were in place:\n— Northbound Interstate 5 at state Route 138\n— Southbound Vista del Lago Road at the entrance to the Vista del Lago Visitors Center\n— Eastbound Castaic Lake Drive at Ridge Route Road\nOne commercial property has been destroyed, while 10 are being threatened, along with 50 single-family residences, fire officials said.\nAuthorities are officially reporting one injury from the fire, although no details were released.\nThe blaze is being battled by a unified command that includes the U.S. Forest Service, Angeles National Forest, the Los Angeles County Fire Department and Ventura County Fire Department. The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, California State Park Services, Los Angeles County Office of Emergency Management, Cal Fire and California Highway Patrol were also providing support.\n“Crews continue making progress on the perimeter of the Post fire … allowing teams to focus more on the interior terrain,” officials said in their Thursday morning update. “Crews continue seeking out isolated smoke and heat sources that produced small flare ups (Wednesday). Increased temperatures are expected over the next several days and into the weekend which make these areas a priority.”\nThe South Coast Air Quality Management District issued a wildfire smoke advisory for the Santa Clarita and Castaic areas, with northwesterly winds expected to push smoke from the fire southeast toward Santa Clarita, the San Fernando Valley and parts of the Angeles National Forest.\nThe SCAQMD advised people in the area to limit their exposure by remaining indoors with windows and doors closed or by seeking immediate shelter, avoid vigorous physical activity and to run their air conditioners or air purifiers.\n“It’s best to avoid using swamp coolers or whole house fans that bring in outside air,” the agency said. “Residents should also avoid burning wood in their fireplaces or firepits. And, if they absolutely must be outside, a properly fit N95 mask or P100 respirator may provide some protection.\nThe Post fire started at about 1:45 p.m. Saturday at Ralph’s Ranch and Gorman School roads, near the 5 Freeway, Los Angeles County Fire Department spokesman Craig Little told City News Service.\nSome 1,747 personnel wee involved in the firefighting effort.\nThe cause of the fire was under investigation.",
