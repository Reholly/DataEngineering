    "text": "BIG SUR – Highway 1 at Paul’s Slide is set to reopen Sunday, according to Caltrans, which credits favorable site conditions and recent construction progress with the earlier than expected completion. It opens access to the community of Lucia, Camaldoli Hermitage, and residents living within the newly reopened 4.3 miles of highway.\nSince Jan. 14, 2023, direct access on Highway 1 through Paul’s Slide has not been possible due to a major slide that displaced an estimated 500,000 cubic yards of material that engulfed the roadway. Earlier this month, Caltrans said the slide location would be ready to open early to mid-July.\n“The challenge at Paul’s Slide has always been to repair Highway 1 while movement continues within the slide location,” said Caltrans Director Tony Tavares in a press release. “The completion of repairs and the reopening of a 4.3-mile section of this scenic byway will begin to restore some normalcy for business owners and residents in the area.”\nOn June 7, repair work at the Dolan Point Side – post mile 29.5 – was completed, four months after it occurred, but it will not change the turnaround point for southbound traffic.\n“With the completion of repairs at the Dolan Point Slide, the turnaround point for southbound Highway 1 traffic will remain in place at Lime Creek – post mile 32.1 – until repairs are complete at Regent’s Slide,” said Kevin Drabinski, Caltrans District 5 spokesman. “The northern turnaround point at Lime Creek is well suited as a turnaround location as it offers a good line of sight on approach and provides ample space for large vehicles to turn around.”\nRepairs at Dolan Point involved a top-down removal of slide material and reduction of rocks by blasting crews, after which double twist cable mesh was installed along the face of the slope.\n“Crews connected the seams of dozens of 150-foot lengths of mesh which were lifted into place by helicopter. This mesh will add an additional layer of protection to the highway below the slope,” explained Drabinski.\nNow that Paul’s Slide – post mile 22 – is opening, traffic coming from the south will be able to come as far north as repair work on the Regent’s Slide – post mile 27.8 – will comfortably allow. The southern turnaround point on Highway 1 will move from Limekiln State Park – post mile 21 – northward to just south of Vicente Creek Bridge – post mile 25.3 – where travelers will have a clear line of sight on approach and ample space for large vehicles to maneuver and turn around.\nAfter the reopening at Paul’s Slide, crews will be on site over the next several weeks to remove additional slide material, complete drainage installation and implement erosion control measures. Travelers will encounter intermittent traffic control with only minimal delays during this work.\nThe contractor for repairs at Paul’s Slide is Papich Construction of Arroyo Grande, according to Caltrans. The total cost of this project is approximately $60 million.\nRepair work at the last remaining closure point on Highway 1 will continue at Regent’s Slide where the northern turnaround point remains at Lime Creek just south of the Esalen Institute. Caltrans estimates repairs at Regent’s Slide will be complete by late fall, at which time Highway 1 will once again be open to direct travel along the entire route of the Big Sur coast between Carmel and Cambria.\nTavares thanked the local community for its patience and support during the time it took to repair Paul’s Slide. He said the state agency also wants to express appreciation for the persistence, ingenuity, and resolve demonstrated by Caltrans personnel and contracted crews throughout this process.\nRoad information and updates can also be found on Caltrans District 5 Social Media platforms: Twitter at: @CaltransD5, Facebook at: Caltrans Central Coast (District 5) and Instagram at: Caltrans_D5.",
