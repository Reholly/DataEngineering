    "text": "BISLIG CITY—Ensuring that the provinces in Mindanao are not left behind in receiving government services, the Bagong Pilipinas Serbisyo Fair (BPSF) returned to the Caraga Region, delivering P600 million worth of government services, programs, and financial aid to 90,000 beneficiaries in Surigao del Sur during a two-day event in the city.\nSpeaker Ferdinand Martin G. Romualdez, representing President Ferdinand “Bongbong” R. Marcos Jr. inaugurated the event on June 21 at the De La Salle John Bosco College Open Field.\nOver 10 government agencies participated in the ceremonial turnover of 14 programs, underscoring the administration’s commitment to bring services directly to the people.\n “We are delighted to engage with the people of Surigao del Sur through the BPSF, demonstrating that President Marcos› government is here to serve and provide various programs and assistance to those in need,” Romualdez said.\nHouse Deputy Secretary General Sofonias P. Gabonada Jr. noted that this was the 20th BPSF nationwide, the second in Caraga after Agusan del Norte, and the ninth in Mindanao.\nWith contributions from 46 national government agencies, over 217 services were offered, including P244 million in cash assistance.\nThe Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) facilitated payouts to 64,000 beneficiaries under the Assistance to Individuals in Crisis Situations (AICS) program, amounting to P216 million. Additionally, the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (Tesda) and the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) offered scholarship programs, while livelihood assistance was provided to various eligible clients.\nAlso, Romualdez led the distribution of 95,000 kilograms of rice to qualified beneficiaries. “Rice distribution is a staple of our BPSF events because we believe rice is life. The government is doing everything to lower its price for Filipino families,” he stated.\n A concert held at the Bislig City Baywalk attracted 10,000 attendees, adding a festive atmosphere to the service fair.\nBesides the the primary BPSF activities, Romualdez spearheaded the distribution of aid under several specialized programs: the Cash and Rice Distribution (CARD) Program, the Start-up, Incentives, Business Opportunity, and Livelihood (SIBOL) Program to provide financial assistance to struggling small entrepreneurs, and the Integrated Scholarship and Incentives for the Youth (ISIP for the Youth) Program.\n In separate ceremonies, 2,000 beneficiaries each received P2,000 and 10 kilograms of rice through the AICS program. The SIBOL program provided P5,000 and 5 kilograms of rice to small entrepreneurs, while the ISIP for the Youth program granted P2,000 every six months, with students also enrolling in CHED’s Tulong Dunong Program and receiving priority slots for the Government Internship Program after graduation.\n Support for BPSF is growing among lawmakers, with over 70 House members attending the Surigao del Sur event.\n“We will continue to bring the BPSF to all 82 provinces, ensuring that every citizen in need receives direct government services, as promised by President Marcos Jr.,” he added.",
