    "text": "After the building was cleared of smoke, all those evacuated were able to return. MURFREESBORO, Tenn. (WSMV) - Firefighters were able to rescue residents from an assisted living tower in Murfreesboro after a fire in the tower’s laundry room. Murfreesboro Fire Rescue said crews went floor to floor assisting residents out of the Westbrook Towers after a laundry room fire sent smoke billowing through the building on Friday morning. First responders were alerted of the fire at the seven-story building on N. Walnut Street at just before 10:30 a.m. Crews were able to quickly extinguish the fire and contain it in the laundry room. No injuries were reported. “Fire crews went throughout the building several times assisting about a third of the residents, some using wheelchairs and walkers, with getting out safely. Many others left the building when the fire alarm sounded. Some residents sheltered in place in stairways where there was no smoke,” MFRD said. A nearby center, St. Clair Senior Center opened its doors for residents to escape the heat outside. After the building was cleared of smoke, all those evacuated were able to return. The cause of the fire is under investigation. Copyright 2024 WSMV. All rights reserved.",
