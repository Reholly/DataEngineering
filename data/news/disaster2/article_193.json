    "text": "The national delinquency rate fell 6 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.04% in May; still the second lowest point on record, behind 2.92% in March 2023 A fifth consecutive monthly improvement in serious delinquencies (those loans 90+ days past due, but not yet in active foreclosure) reset what had already been a more than 18-year low The number of mortgage-holders who’ve missed a single payment dropped by -19K, while 60-day delinquencies edged up slightly (+4K) from April While inflow of borrowers newly 30 days late dropped to a one-year low, those rolling to later stages of delinquency edged higher from April and fewer delinquent loans cured to current status Foreclosure starts were down -6.5% from April, keeping active foreclosure inventory at the lowest level since pandemic-era moratoria were lifted in January 2022 The total number of mortgage-holders currently in active foreclosure remains 32% below (-92K) pre-pandemic levels Though up slightly for the month, foreclosure sales (completions) in May were down -7.2% year over year and remain well below pre-pandemic norms A seasonal rise in home sales and slightly improved refi volumes pushed prepayments to their highest level since September 2022, even as rate-related headwinds persist\nIntercontinental Exchange, Inc.
