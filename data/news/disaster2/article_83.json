    "text": "CATALDO, Idaho â€” A North Idaho woman who has been missing for the past few days has been found, according to the Kootenai County Sheriff's Office (KCSO). KCSO said a man found Linda Kent on his ranch on South Tamarack Ridge Road in Cataldo Thursday night. According to KCSO, the ranch is several miles away from her last known location, which was a boat launch near Cataldo. KCSO also said the ranch is in the general Cataldo area. KCSO said Kent was taken to the hospital to be treated for dehydration and was reunited with her family. The sheriff's office called off the search for Kent on Tuesday, saying the search ended after search and rescue \"exhausted all resources.\" Lieutenant Zachary Sifford told KREM 2 News earlier this week marine units, canines, and a helicopter were used without picking up a sign of Kent. \"Thank you to all of the citizens who called in with information regarding this case,\" KCSO said in a press release Thursday evening.
