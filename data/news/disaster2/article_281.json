They were scared they were going back to the water. It was terrible.\"\nFor more Lifestyle articles, visit www.foxnews/lifestyle\nThe owner of the dogs tried to pay Chrestman, but he refused to take the reward, Gist said.\nThe small bass boat was only able to hold a few dogs at a time.\nGist has labeled Chrestman a true hero of the dog rescue.\n\"If Brad and I had been there in a boat by ourselves, we wouldn't have known anything was wrong, but that 20-something-year-old kid – I'm 61, so I'm calling him a kid – he knew something needed to be done,\" Gist said.\n\"That kid had the presence of mind to know, 'If we don't do something, there's going to be 38 dead dogs here.' And he saved them, I mean we all pulled them in, but that kid is the hero here.\"\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\nGist labeled Chrestman the hero of the day after quickly analyzing the situation and leading the animals' rescue.\nGist said that while he gives full credit to Chrestman, he is grateful to have assisted in the mission to bring the animals to safety.\nOriginal article source: Fishermen in Mississippi pull off dramatic rescue of 38 dogs treading water\nView comments",
