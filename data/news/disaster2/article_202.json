Mr Stalin said apart from the already announced Rs 10 lakh assistance, the government would provide a maintenance allowance of Rs 5,000 per month to children who have been orphaned in the tragedy and would be brought up by a guardian.

The Chief Minister said if the children, if they are willing, would be admitted to government-run homes or homes functioning with government aid.Responding to some member's remarks that the Chief Minister should own responsibility for the tragedy, Mr Stalin said as the one holding the home portfolio and also as the Chief Minister, he would run away and hide on any issues.He also pointed out to the action taken against erring district police officials, transfer of District Collector, suspension of the District SP and PEW personnel, ordering a CB-CID probe, besides a Judicial probe into the incident.
