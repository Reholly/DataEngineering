    "text": "ODESSA, Texas ‚Äî A handful of local and small businesses in the Permian Basin have formed a coalition to garner as many donations for victims of the Ruidoso wildfires .\nUpon viewing the images of the destructive wildfires, Derrick Black started making calls to get as many businesses involved.\n\"Watching these trees, these animals and these family's homes turn into ashes really hit home,\" said Black, a member of the nonprofit organization called Oilfield Connections International , and a part of Farm Energy Technologies.\nHere's a list of local businesses who are keeping their doors open and welcoming donations.\nüìçDonation Drop-Off Locations:\nAmerican Safety Services, Inc. on 13416 E IH-20 Odessa, TX. 79765 TLR Welding & Fabricating, Inc - TLR Hose & Supply on 7300 W I-20 frontage Midland, TX. 79706 TXAM Pumps on 2381 E I-20 Odessa, TX. 79766 JA Oilfield Manufacturing and Services, Inc. 14579 HollyHock Ave. Gardendale, TX. 79758 Cameron, a Schlumberger company on 4580 W. Wall St. Midland, TX. 79703 Southern Tire Mart on 12618 E I-20 Odessa, TX 79765 PERSEVERANCE SERVICES LLC is providing the transportation needed to make these deliveries possible \"Right now our biggest concentration is to help the firefighters out there, so things like non- perishable foods, snacks, waters,\" Black said. \"One of the residents who actually reached out to me directly and what they're mentioning is they need twin size sheets because a lot of the displaced families are having to sleep on cots and they don't have sheets to cover these beds.\"\nBlack said other requests may include dry foods for pets.\nTXAM Pumps will be serving as the main hub for donations, keeping its doors open through the weekend.\n\"That's the spirit that we have as Americans,\" said Johnny Garcia with TXAM Pumps. \"This is our land we need to protect it. We need to take care of it. And when a catastrophe like this happens, we rise up.\"\nThis round of donations will be accepted through Monday of the following week. According to Black, they'll continue the efforts for as long as it's needed.\nRelated Articles Wildfires in Ruidoso in real time West Texans come together to help Ruidoso wildfire victims Gov.
