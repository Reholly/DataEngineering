    "text": "WALTON COUNTY, Fla. ( [WMBB](https://www.mypanhandle.com/news/local-news/walton-county/more-than-4k-raised-in-ribbons-for-lulu-fundraiser/)) – A fundraiser for one of the June 7 shark bite victims is really taking off. Last week, we told you about the ribbons for Lulu’s campaign. Jane Denton with Beachy Blooms 30-A is selling big purple bows for $20. The money goes to 15-year-old Lulu Gribbin, who lost a hand and a leg in the June 7 attack. The florist and avid bow maker said her goal was to make the community shine purple which is Lulu’s favorite color. In just 10 days, Denton received more than 200 orders, totaling $4,000. “I was at Peddlers Pavilion yesterday and they have big, shiny purple ribbons up all over and it just warms my heart makes me feel really good. And I know the community also feels really good that we’re doing something to help Lulu,” Beachy Blooms 30-A, Jane Denton said. There are five pick-up locations also selling ribbons. For the list of those locations, [click here.](https://www.facebook.com/beachyblooms30a) There is an online fundraiser for attack survivor Elizabeth Foley. It’s raised more than $95,000.",
