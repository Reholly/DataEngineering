    "text": "Woman reported missing found safe after spending night on Tallahala Creek sandbar From Jones County Fire Council Public Information Office JONES COUNTY, Miss. (WDAM) - A woman who touched off an overnight search Saturday after being reported missing along the Tallahala Creek turned up safe Sunday morning after spending the night on a sandbar. The Jones County Fire Council said that first responders from South Jones, Southwest, Moselle, Union and Boggy volunteer fire departments were alerted around 11 p.m. Saturday about a woman reported missing near the creek at Union Bridge. The woman, whose identity never was given, reportedly had been floating the creek and broke away from her group to return home about 6:30 pm. When the group she had been floating with arrived back at their parking area, they realized the woman was missing when her car was still parked in the same place it had been when the group entered the water. Members of the five volunteer fire departments searched all night, along with Mississippi Forestry wardens and numerous civilians. The searchers were on scene from about 11 p.m. Saturday until 9 a.m. Sunday, covering an area spanning from Union Bridge to Morriston Road on the creek. With limited personnel, firefighters received assistance from Wayne County’s Tracy West, who arrived with a drone. Glade and Southwest VFDs responded with rescue boats, but the creek’s shallowness limited their use. Ultimately, personnel from Boggy and Southwest VFDs utilized a john boat to search the area. About 8 a.m. Sunday, the woman was found on North Pumping Station Road, walking along a power line that ran directly from the river. JCFC said the woman reported she had gotten lost getting back to her car and spent the night on a sandbar, until she felt it was safe to venture out at daylight. The woman declined medical treatment and transport. Want more WDAM 7 news in your inbox? Click [here](https://www.wdam.com/newsletter/) to subscribe to our newsletter. Copyright 2024 WDAM.
