    "text": "LABELLE, Fla. (WFTX) - A dog missing for two years after she walked away from her Maryland home was overjoyed at being reunited with her owner.\nTony Duncan says he lives in a wooded area in Mardela Springs, Maryland, and would let his dog, Luna, walk the property freely. About two years ago, Luna chased after some wildlife and vanished into the woods. Her owner looked for her but couldn’t find her.\n“Been sitting, waiting and hoping for two years now that she would return… and today’s the day,” Duncan said.\nAs it turned out, Luna somehow traveled more than 1,000 miles from her home in Maryland to LaBelle, Florida.\nDuncan got an unexpected call Wednesday from LaBelle Animal Control, who found his missing dog walking in a Walmart parking lot and scanned her microchip.\nLuna’s owner says he and his friend cleared their schedules without hesitation, rented a car and made the 16-hour drive to LaBelle, so he could reunite with his dog.\n“Well, apparently, she’s been living in Florida for two years, so she definitely knows where to vacation,” Duncan said.\nDuncan suspects someone may have stolen Luna and brought her to Florida, only to abandon her later. The exact details of the dog’s journey remain a mystery known only to her.\nLaBelle Animal Control is emphasizing the importance of microchipping pets. They say this reunion would not have been possible without Luna’s chip.\nCopyright 2024 WFTX via CNN Newsource. All rights reserved.",
