    "text": "The office of House Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez has facilitated the release of P2.5 million in cash assistance from the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) to 125 families displaced by a fire in Barangay 58 in Tondo, Manila on June 16.\nHouse Deputy Secretary General Sofonias Gabonada Jr. said each family received P20,000 under the DSWD’s Assistance to Individuals in Crisis Situation (AICS) program through the seamless delivery of aid by Manila Rep. Ernesto Dionisio Jr.\nHe said the Office of the Speaker, along with Tingog party-list Reps. Yedda Romualdez and Jude Acidre prepared 400 food packs for fire victims sourced from the personal calamity funds of lawmakers.\n“Through the concerted efforts of the Office of Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez, Tingog party-list, and DSWD, we have mobilized immediate relief for the families devastated by the Tondo fire,” he added.\n“Furthermore, an additional allocation from the AICS program has been provided, ensuring each affected family will receive P20,000 to help them recover and rebuild,” he cited.\nThe Office of the Speaker stressed the importance of swift action in times of crisis, saying it is crucial to respond quickly to reduce the impact on affected communities.\n“Our priority is to provide immediate and meaningful assistance to those affected by this unfortunate incident,” Gabonada said.\n“By working together with DSWD and Congressman Dionisio, we aim to alleviate the suffering of the fire victims and help them rebuild their lives as quickly as possible,” he added.\nDionisio expressed his gratitude for the swift action and support to the fire victims.\n“We are deeply thankful to Speaker Romualdez for his unwavering commitment to aiding our constituents in times of crisis,” he said.\n“His (Speaker Romualdez’s) leadership has been instrumental in securing the necessary resources to help the fire victims of Tondo. This assistance will go a long way in providing immediate relief and supporting the recovery of our affected families,” he noted.\nGabonada said the Office of the Speaker, along with the Tingog party-list will continue to monitor the situation and ensure that all necessary support is extended to the affected families.",
