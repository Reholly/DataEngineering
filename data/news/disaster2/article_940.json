    "text": "OKLAHOMA CITY ( [KFOR](http://kfor.com)) – The National Reining Horse Association is a close knit circle. “You’re competing against one another,” said Brandon Brant of Belle Center, Ohio. “But then something like this happens. It’s unbelievable how everybody’s pulled together.” When tragedy struck at Brant’s barn, about an hour north of Columbus, the news quickly made its way to Oklahoma. “The first 911 call went in at 12:15 Ohio time, which was 11:15 here. By 12:00 here, this place was as somber as you’ve ever seen,” said Sean Johnson, a horse trainer from Tulsa and Brant’s best friend. Earlier this month, flames engulfed Brant’s 60,000 square-foot barn. The fire sent one man, Eric Priest, to the ICU and killed 44 horses. “The flick of a finger and it’s gone,” said Brant. “It’s awful. It is the worst thing I’ve ever experienced and like I said, I wouldn’t wish it on anybody. I mean, this is one of the biggest tragedies in our industry.” Perhaps unsurprisingly Oklahomans and others all around the world have stepped up to help Brant, Priest and their customers get back in the saddle. Over the last week or so, hundreds of donations have been piling up at the NRHA Derby in Oklahoma City. “This generosity is huge,” said Johnson. “These people, they’ve lost everything.They lost all their equipment, their help, right down to their clothes. I mean, they lost their hopes and dreams.” The donated items will be auctioned off next week June 24 through June 26. “It’s unbelievable. The immense support from Oklahoma City, the NRHA,” said Brant. “I can never thank everybody. I could try but it’s just so immense.” More information about the efforts to help Brant, Priest and their customers can be found [here](https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fprofile.php%3Fid%3D61560795390393&data=05%7C02%7CCaroline.Sellers%40kfor.com%7C73af681114b94c0b986608dc9208a48d%7C9e5488e2e83844f6886cc7608242767e%7C0%7C0%7C638545813013886996%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=MejAA6pPrI%2B9LatPybJfx98E69qIdrFq9uDZZEVsWnU%3D&reserved=0).
