    "text": "Parents' delight as new zebra crossing confirmed for community where two girls were hit by car A new zebra crossing is to be installed in a busy street where two children were struck by a car prompting worried mothers to set up their own safety patrols. The move follows a collision where two schoolgirls were treated in hospital after being knocked down outside Old Church CE Primary School in Darlaston last September. Now Walsall Council has confirmed that the crossing will be installed in nearby busy Willenhall Street during the school summer holiday and that a recruitment drive is underway to find a designated [crossing patrol supervisor](https://ejti.fa.em3.oraclecloud.com/hcmUI/CandidateExperience/en/sites/WMBC/requisitions/preview/337/?keyword=School+Crossing+Patrol+Wardens+-+Ref%3A+EE01824&mode=geolocation) to assist pupils. Worried [parents temporarily set up their own crossing patrols](https://www.expressandstar.com/news/local-hubs/walsall/darlaston/2023/10/04/parents-take-it-upon-themselves-to-protect-their-children-on-road) and raised [petitions](https://www.expressandstar.com/news/local-hubs/walsall/darlaston/2023/10/01/mother-leads-call-for-road-safety-measures-after-schoolgirls-hurt-near-walsall-school) attracting more than 600 signatures calling for more road safety measures along the 20mph street due to some motorists ignoring the warning signs on the commuter route between Darlaston and Willenhall.",
