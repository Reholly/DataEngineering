    "text": "Media release | Saturday, 22 June 2024 The Australian Council for International Development (ACFID), the peak body for international development and humanitarian action, and the Sudanese Australian Advocacy Network (SAAN) endorse Australia's $23 million aid package for the Horn of Africa. Of the funding, $13 million will go toward humanitarian relief for those in war-torn Sudan and forced to flee to neighbouring countries. Another $6 million will provide life-saving aid in Ethiopia and Somalia, and $4 million in Kenya, where violence, floods and drought have caused acute food shortages. ACFID Humanitarian Advisor Naomi Brooks said: \"ACFID welcomes the Australian government's life saving aid package for people without shelter, food, clean water or basic healthcare across the Horn of Africa. \"Sudan is the epicentre of the world's largest humanitarian crisis after more than a year of devastating civil war. More than 10 million people have been forced from their homes and tens of thousands killed while millions are at risk of starvation. \"Children have been separated from their families, women subject to horrific sexual violence, civilians forcibly disappeared and killed indiscriminately. \"The additional funding will help provide the essentials of life for people most in need. It will be delivered through Australian and local non-government organisations with deep expertise and a proven track record in responding to humanitarian crises.\" Sudanese Australian Advocacy Network SAAN Co-founder and President Amad Mohamed said: \"Each day, Sudanese Australians fear the worst for their loved ones in Sudan. Nowhere is safe from the fighting, and access to humanitarian aid has become a matter of life or death. \"Aid from countries like Australia is crucial to saving lives. Our community thanks the Albanese government for its ongoing support.\"",
