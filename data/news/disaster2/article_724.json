    "text": "The conflict in Gaza has resulted in many people struggling with acute malnutrition because of the lack of sufficient food being delivered and the inability of health care clinics to provide services. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are 8,000 children aged less than 5 who have been diagnosed with acute malnutrition , with 1,600 of them diagnosed with severe acute malnutrition.\nFurthermore, as of May 21, 2024, only one-third of the 36 hospitals in Gaza still function, which impacts thousands of Gazans struggling with urgent health issues. As a result, countries such as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and organizations such as the United Nations (U.N.) have utilized their resources to aid the people through food and medical assistance.\nThe King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center On June 12, 2024, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, through the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center (KSRelief), delivered its 53rd relief plane for Gaza to help the people severely impacted by the fighting. KSRelief’s 53rd relief plane for Gaza contained food and medical supplies to alleviate the pain of the Gazans. The aircraft arrived at Egypt’s El-Arish International Airport to be transferred across the border to Gaza. This highlights the importance of international collaboration in providing aid to Gazans when the conflict has rendered humanitarian assistance almost impossible.\nKSRelief’s 53rd relief aircraft for Gaza reflects Saudi Arabia’s consistent support for the people enduring pain and suffering in Gaza and Palestine as a whole. For example, on March 20, 2024, KSRelief announced that it provided $40 million to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) to help with its life-saving operations in Gaza.\nFurthermore, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia raised more than $100 million for Gaza and Palestine via its “Sahem” national portal, which allows Saudi citizens to donate money to support humanitarian aid. Saudi Arabia’s national and multilateral efforts to help Gaza and Palestine as a whole have been a beacon of hope for those severely impacted by the fighting.\nInternational Organizations at the Forefront International humanitarian organizations have also been working extensively to help the people in Gaza since the war started on October 7, 2023, despite the immense challenges facing them. For example, as of June 6, 2024, the WHO has supplied essential trauma emergency kits and kits for noncommunicable diseases and severe acute malnutrition to those most affected by the conflict.\nIn addition, in May 2024, the World Food Programme (WFP) provided food aid to more than a million people in Gaza and the West Bank despite reducing rations due to access constraints. This illustrates how international humanitarian organizations have been unwavering in their determination to help Gaza even as the fighting intensifies.\nHumanitarian Aid andEnding the War in Gaza Although people have been inundated with horrific stories about Gaza, there have also been many instances where countries such as Saudi Arabia and international organizations such as the WHO are working tirelessly to help the people and give them hope. KSRelief’s 53rd relief plane for Gaza shows how regional countries have been working hard not just to provide aid but to put an end to the war and hopefully bring peace to them and the entire Middle East.\nOn the other hand, the WFP’s courageous efforts to deliver food to Gaza despite access constraints show how even actors outside the region want to help end the fighting. This highlights how humanitarian aid is not just a short-term solution to this war but a tireless effort to bring lasting peace to people who endure pain daily.\n– Abdullah Dowaihy\nAbdullah is based in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia and focuses on Good News and Global Health for The Borgen Project.\nPhoto: Flickr",
