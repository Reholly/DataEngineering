    "text": "UPDATE (6/21/24 : 3:11 p.m.) — The City of Mannford said all of the tests came back with no bacteria so the boil order was lifted at 8 p.m. on Thursday. MANNFORD, Okla. — The City of Mannford has been under a boil order since this past weekend. The City issued that order after a waterline break affected Salt Creek and a few homes on Lakeview. As of now, the City is currently testing the waters. They should know by Thursday if the boil order can be lifted. \"There were six of us that ended up making the repair Monday evening and got it done. It wasn't easy, it was hard, but we got it done,” said Jeremy Brown, the City’s gas superintendent. Last Friday, a section of a pipe under the Keystone Lake came loose, which caused a water leak. The water main crossing that’s under Keystone Lake supplies the Pelican Point Addition. \"Friday evening, there was a little water pressure in my house. I called the water guys in and said, 'hey, I think we've got a water break’,” Brown said. Brown and his crew went searching all around town looking for the water leak. Zane Timmons, gas tech with the City of Mannford, located the leak 30 feet off the shore line of the lake. Brown reached out to Salt Creek Marina for help with underwater repairs. \"He had no hesitation. He was wondering why we didn't come to him at first. He was busy, he had other things going, but he just stepped up and said yea let's go do it,\" Brown said. Brown said they were able to finish the repairs late Monday evening, but he's not sure how the waterline break happened. \"There's really nothing that we can do to predict it happening. At the end of the day, we didn't want the waterline to break and we didn't want to be out there that evening repairing it. It's in the ground, things get old and they break, unfortunately,\" Brown said. The City said those who were affected by the Pelican Point Water Outage need to boil their water until Mannford receives confirmation test results. FOX23 will continue to check on the boil water order and let you know when it's lifted.",
