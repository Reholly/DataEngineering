    "text": "JACKSONVILLE, Ore. – Multiple agencies are assisting with fire operations on the Upper Applegate fire burning in Jackson County. One of those agencies is the Jacksonville Fire Department. Jacksonville Fire was called for mutual aid Thursday night to help with structure protection. They helped residents close to the fire prepare their property as much as possible in case the fire moved close. This allowed more resources to be allocated to the fire. “It's a team effort,” said Jacksonville Fire captain Brian Barrett. “You can't just wall off one community and expect that the agencies within that (community) can handle a hundred percent of what goes on entirely.” Barrett said this also emphasized the role residents play in making sure resources aren’t tied up elsewhere. If residents practice safe habits, this allows fire resources to be available when they are needed most. “The crew that was on (the Upper Applegate Fire), they were kicking butt and it just hit them sideways,” Barrett said. “They couldn't anticipate that happening. It can happen to any crew, it can happen to any community.” NewsWatch 12 recently covered Jacksonville Fire’s student firefighter program. The link to that story is below. Fire stations throughout the Rogue Valley are filling holes in staffing with student firefighter programs, while teaching the students the skills they need to be active firefighters in the community. Students also helped out with the mutual aid response. Barrett said it was a great chance for the students to learn about situations where they’re called to help in other jurisdictions. “They have as much responsibility as a firefighter would once they're certified to that level,” Barrett said. “We expect them to be able to perform certain tasks and be ready, willing, and able to step in and (do) anything that we need them to do on an emergency.”",
