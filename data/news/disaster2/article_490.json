    "text": "SANTA CRUZ COUNTY, Calif. (KSBW) - A missing hiker was finally rescued after he was lost for 10 days in the Santa Cruz Mountains of California.\nThe 34-year-old man was only going for a three-hour hike when he disappeared.\n“I didn’t bring anything because I thought I was doing a three-hour hike to go to work,” Lukas McClish, the rescued hiker, said.\nHe was lost in the woods for nine nights and 10 days, shirtless with only a flashlight and folding scissors.\nIt would be more than a week before the raggedy-looking hiker would be found.\n“So, I kind of just hiked. Each day, I go up a canyon, down a canyon to the next waterfall, sit down by the waterfall, drink water out of my boot,” Lukas McClish recalled.\nIt was a Tuesday when Lukas McClish went for a hike in Boulder Creek and ended up getting lost.\n“I felt comfortable the whole time I was out there. I wasn’t worried about it,” Lukas McClish said. “I had a mountain lion that was following me, but it was cool. It kept its distances. I think it was just somebody watching over me.”\nThe problem was that Lukas McClish didn’t tell anyone where he was going.\nBy the time Father’s Day rolled around on Sunday, his family started worrying and filed a missing person’s report.\nThe search was on then.\n“Some nights, although, I just had to trust God that he was going to be OK, and that was hard to do some nights when we would go to bed at night because I would worry about where he was, where he was sleeping and how cold he was and where he was if he was alive,” Diane McClish, the hiker’s mother, said.\nLukas McClish drank from water from creeks, ate wild berries and slept on a wet bed of leaves all while yelling for help and thinking of his next meal.\n“‘Just help. Help, I’m over here.’ Or, ‘Is anybody out there?’” Lukas McClish remembered saying while he was lost. “I want a burrito or a taco bowl. That’s what I thought about every day when I, after the first five days, when I started to kind of realize that I might be in over my head.”\nBut on Thursday afternoon, someone finally heard his cries for help.\nThe Boulder Creek Fire Department deployed a drone and spotted his location.\nA K-9 tracked him down and Lukas McClish was escorted out of a remote canyon, finally reunited with family.\n“Met a lot of people because I had more people come to me and tell me how much they love my son and how they just hoped that we would find him,” Diane McClish said. “I didn’t realize that so many people in this town love Luke.”\nFortunately, Lukas McClish had no major injuries.\nCopyright 2024 KSBW via CNN Newsource.
