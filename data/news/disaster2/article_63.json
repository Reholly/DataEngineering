    "text": "“Giving Back to Ruidoso”: West Texas community unites to support Ruidoso amid ongoing fires WEST TEXAS, Texas (KOSA) - As the ongoing fires in Ruidoso create hardships for families, businesses, and first responders, our thoughts are with those affected. In just three days since the fire began, West Texans have united making significant contributions and donations to aid the relief efforts for the people of Ruidoso. You can help, too, through a West Texan’s initiative to support evacuees from Ruidoso. Derrick Black, a compassionate and proactive citizen, spearheaded this initiative after a recent visit to Ruidoso. Reflecting on his trip two months ago, Black recalled the beauty of the hills and the charm of the city. He never imagined that such a devastating event would occur just weeks later. Ruidoso holds a special place in Black’s heart, and he feels a deep personal connection to the community. “Everything Ruidoso has given me, I want to give back,” he said. The heart-wrenching videos of the fires compelled him to take action and mobilize relief efforts. Though the initiative doesn’t have an official name yet, support for these efforts has already taken flight, driven by the theme of “Giving Back to Ruidoso.” For Black, there was no doubt that the West Texas community would lend a helping hand. After making few phone calls, six local businesses opened their premises as drop-off locations. Current Donation Needs: Water: Crucial for hydration and fire suppression. Food: Non-perishable goods to sustain families through these challenging circumstances. Essential Supplies: Items to aid and assist those navigating this difficult time. Specific items requested include diapers, wipes, and twin bed sheets for cots, which are essential for the large number of displaced individuals. Black calls this effort a “call to action” for all members of our community to unite, provide support, and give back to those in Ruidoso. Full list of donation drop-off locations: How to Donate: Money donations are also being accepted directly via Cash App, Venmo, Zelle and through the account “Giving Back to Ruidoso” made by Black.
