    "text": "The Commissioner for Health, Akwa Ibom State, Prof. Augustine Umoh says the state government has put precautionary measures in place to tackle any incident of cholera outbreak in the state.\nIn an interview on Friday, Umoh stated that though there was no recorded case of cholera in Akwa Ibom, the state government has commenced an intensive sensitization across the 31 Local Government Areas of the state on the need to maintain personal and environmental hygiene, especially at this time.\nHe said the government has stocked up emergency drugs such as fluid and necessary medicaments in all Primary Health Centres in case of any outbreak.\nAccording to him, “For now, there is no reported case of cholera outbreak in the state. We have commenced sensitization of residents to maintain hygiene both personal and environmental.\n“Residents during this period are advised to boil and cool water before drinking. Wash their hands with soap and clean water regularly, especially after the use of toilet and before eating. Wash fruits and other food items before eating.\n“Residents should also take salt sugar solution in case of diarrhoea and report to the nearest health centre for prompt action.”\nUmoh also noted that the state government has reactivated all emergency operations centres across the state to forestall any outbreak adding that the government would continue to monitor and ensure surveillance, especially in the border communities.",
