    "text": "Arriving at a Nisbet home earlier than she was expected, a pet sitter saved the day Sunday afternoon when she saw smoke pouring from a shed on the Susquehanna Township property, according to fire officials. “We were so so lucky that the fire was discovered as soon as it was,” Nisbet Fire Chief James Pfleegor said. Close to 20 volunteer firefighters from Nisbet, DuBoistown and Nisbet’s Clark Street firehouse in South Williamsport responded when the fire companies were dispatched to a shed fire in the 200 block of Valley Road about 12:30 p.m. The situation was brought under control within 15 minutes, Pfleegor said, adding he believed a disaster clearly was avoided by the pet sitter discovering the fire when she did and calling 911. “Directly behind the shed were two 250-gallon propane tanks, and the house is just 12 feet away from the tanks,” he said. “Had those tanks caught fire, we’d probably still be there right now putting the fire out,” Pfleegor told a reporter hours after the dispatch. He estimated damage was under $5,000, and he said the family had insurance on the shed. The cause of the fire was believed to electrical in nature, Pfleegor added.",
