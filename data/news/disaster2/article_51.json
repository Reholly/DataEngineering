    "text": "Two beluga whales have arrived safely in Spain after a grueling odyssey across Europe from a war-torn part of Ukraine.\nBombs were dropping close to the whales’ home at the NEMO Dolphinarium in Kharkiv, according to a June 19 news release from the Georgia Aquarium. So, rescuers made a plan to bring them to safety, but the journey wasn’t easy.\nIn addition to Ukraine being at war, the whales were not in the best shape. Food and medicine shortages had caused their health to diminish.\nThe whales had a “suboptimal body condition to undertake this type of trip, but if they had continued in Kharkiv, their chances of survival would have been very slim,” said Dr. Daniel Garcia-Párraga, director of zoological operations at Oceanogràfic Valencia.\nSince the Russia’s invasion in 2022, the dolphinarium has been slowly evacuating its animals. However, moving two beluga whales is a whole other feat.\n“The complexities of this evacuation were immense, and we have been working for weeks to prepare for it,” said Dennis Christen, senior director of animal well-being and behavior at the Georgia Aquarium.\n The rescue was treacherous and required efforts from multiple countries.\nThe day of evacuation, rescuers took the two belugas – 15-year-old Plombir, a male, and 14-year-old Miranda, a female. In a vehicle, the group braved the dangerous, 12-hour drive from Kharkiv to Odesa.\nIn Odesa, they met the team from the Georgia Aquarium who conducted health checks on the whales before continuing onward to Moldova.\nA six-seater charter plane awaited the group in Chisinau.\n...continued swipe to next page « 1 2 » View full story\n©2024 The Charlotte Observer.
