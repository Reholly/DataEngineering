The grant also allowed us to upgrade our Emergency Operations Center with new data-connected equipment to enhance overall emergency response capabilities.”\n“The 2022 Duke Energy Emergency Preparedness Grant has been instrumental in allowing Brunswick County Emergency Management to be better prepared to support countywide damage assessments and search and rescue efforts in isolated and hard to reach areas,” said David McIntire, Emergency Management Director. “We were very fortunate to receive this funding and look forward to our continued relationship with Duke Energy.”\nDuke Energy Foundation\nThe Duke Energy Foundation provides more than $30 million annually in philanthropic support to meet the needs of communities where Duke Energy customers live and work.
