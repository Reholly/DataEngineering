    "text": "Work is set to start on a \"transformative\" flood defence scheme in Ireland's Cork City that will protect homes and businesses in one of its most vulnerable quays.\nThe Morrison's Island project, delivered by main contractor Jons with support from the Office of Public Works (OPW), will regenerate a 500m stretch of the River Lee from Parnell Bridge to Parliament Bridge.\nAccording to the project team, the scheme will provide flood protection for approximately 400 properties and seek to \"unlock\" an area that has been used mainly as car parking.\nThe area will be redesigned and \"reoriented\" towards the river with public realm works including new pavements, public seating, a new plaza space and a river viewing platform at Parnell Bridge as well as a public space by Trinity Bridge.\nOne of the key features of the plan will be a new 3m wide riverside promenade between Morrison's Island and Fr Mathew Quay.\nThere will be new entrances on the north and south side of Trinity Bridge, with a flared entrance on its north side with ramp access down to the bridge deck and large benched steps forming seating at the entrance.\nSimilarly, the south side will include flared entrances onto Union Quay while the east side of the bridge will open up into a 30m boardwalk that runs north along the existing footpath at Union Quay.\nIt is understood that construction of the scheme will cost around £16M.\nCork City's coastal marsh location has meant that it has suffered from a number of devastating floods. In 2009, floods resulting in £76M worth of damages to private and public property and infrastructure.\nWelcoming the commencement of works, Cork Lord Mayor Kieran McCarthy said: “The Morrison’s Island Scheme is the city’s opportunity to bring about comprehensive regeneration of this historic part of the city and to re-orientate it towards the river, transforming it into a top-class public space, and highlighting features of architectural and heritage interest.”\nCork City Council chief executive Ann Doherty said: “This scheme will transform the Morrison’s Island area of the city and provide much needed flood protection to hundreds of residents and businesses. This south-facing riverside area has so much more to offer and Cork City Council, with the support of the OPW, is unlocking that potential, providing for the revitalisation and regeneration of this part of the city centre”.\nThe scheme is expected to be completed within approximately 20 months.\nLike what you've read?\nTo receive New Civil Engineer's daily and weekly newsletters click here.",
