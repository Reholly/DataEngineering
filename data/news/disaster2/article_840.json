    "text": "In short: Researchers from Canada are trying to understand how a festival can help or hinder a community and its recovery after a disaster. The team is studying Lismore in NSW and three other locations around the world that have experienced catastrophic events. What's next? The team will travel to the last destination and wrap up the three-year study. How soon is too soon to dip your toes back into fun after a traumatic experience?\nA new global study, entitled Revelry and Resilience, is attempting to answer that question by examining the role of festivals in communities that have experienced disasters.\n\"We're trying to understand the ways that festivals can contribute to community recovery, or in some cases don't contribute to community recovery,\" lead researcher Christine van Winkle explained.\nFor three decades the Lismore Lantern Parade has been a light in the lives of people in the north-east of NSW. ( ABC News: Max Tillman )\nDr van Winkle, an associate professor in kinesiology and recreation management at Canada's University of Manitoba, and her team are in Australia to research the effects of Lismore's Lantern Parade, which celebrated its 30th year on Saturday.\nThe researchers selected Lismore as one of four locations around the world to study, because it has an annual festival and the community was devastated by the catastrophic floods in northern New South Wales in 2022, while still reeling from the effects of the COVID pandemic.\nThe other locations being studied are in Cyprus, the Caribbean and Canada.\nDr Christine van Winkle is leading the Revelry and Resilience global study. ( Supplied: Kiri Shafto, University of Manitoba )\n\"The timing really matters when events take place,\" Dr van Winkle said.\n\"Sometimes it can be a bit too soon and that can present challenges for a community which isn't quite ready to come together.\n\"However, in other communities, they will say it's never too soon to come back together and have a healing experience.\n\"So I think there is a lot of subtlety around what's appropriate in the unique community where the event takes place.\"\nLismore's Lantern Parade falls into that category.\n'Part of Lismore's culture' The Lismore parade's artistic director, Jilly Jackson, says the festival has never skipped a beat, despite COVID and the devastating flood of 2022.\n\"The Lantern Parade makes people feel that things will be alright,\" said Ms Jackson.\nMark Burton says the parade has helped him to feel that life is \"normal\" again. ( ABC News: Max Tillman )\nThat perspective was echoed by Lismore resident Mark Burton, who was interviewed on the night of the parade by the research team.\n\"We've all been completely and profoundly affected by that [flood] event. It's very helpful and normalising to be back at an event like [the Lantern Parade],\" Mr Burton said.\nRebuilding the arts after floods After floods devastated the Northern Rivers, the arts sector is looking ahead at how to adapt and rebuild.\nRead more\n\"My children have all been through it and now my grandchildren have their turn. It's a pretty valuable part of Lismore's culture.\"\nCanadian PhD researcher Kiri Shafto said she was struck by how readily people were willing to talk on the evening of the festival.\n\"This might be Australia in general, but people are incredibly open,\" she said.\n\"It seems to be a lynch pin, coming through COVID and then the flood and then to see the Lantern Parade be able to go ahead, it almost was a relief to people,\" Ms Shafto said.\nKiri Shafto is researching the role of festivals in the recovery process for communities struck by disaster. ( ABC News: Max Tillman )\n'Hugely psychologically important' For Lismore business owner Deborah Ray, the parade has been essential to her recovery and she even timed the re-opening of her flood-ravaged store, Music Bizarre, with the 2022 parade.\n\"The whole town was so destroyed and so ugly and broken, (and) to have people coming in and be excited to watch the lanterns, it's hugely important,\" she said.\nAs a business owner, Ms Ray said she saw direct benefit from the Lismore festival.\n\"It was hugely psychologically important for the uplifting of spirits and bringing in some money,\" she said.\nDeborah Ray from Lismore's Music Bizarre timed the re-opening of her flood hit business to coincide with the Lismore Lantern Parade. ( ABC News: Max Tillman )\n\"It's life blood being pumped back into the city.\"\nMr Burton said the good vibes of the lantern event helped him feel to feel \"normal\".\n\"It's value is hard to measure really,\" he said.\n\"For a lot of us getting back to normal was important and certainly the Lantern Parade is an institution that supports our culture here.\"\nParade lights up community connections As the researchers try to quantify the intangible they made a few observations about recovery in the Lismore community.\nResearcher Kiri Shaft says people she spoke to in Lismore during the parade were \"very open\". ( ABC News: Max Tillman )\n\"Something that Kiri and I noticed was how connected this community is,\" Dr van Winkle said.\n\"It really seemed at the event that there was a lot of re-connecting that was happening.\n\"People who have maybe been displaced or chosen to leave, seemed to have come back to the Lantern Parade to re-connect.\n\"That was the most powerful sense we had [at the event],\" Dr van Winkle said.\n\"If you can [offer that] to a community which is still very much in recovery mode, then you are doing something right,\" Ms Shafto said.\nPosted 21m ago 21 minutes ago Mon 24 Jun 2024 at 1:43am Share\nCopy link\nFacebook\nX (formerly Twitter)\nRelated Stories This is what it's like to live in a flood recovery pod Northern Rivers towns pull out all the stops for Anzac Day despite devastating floods Rhonda Hayes calls them 'her sons, her grandsons, her angels' who helped her in her darkest hour 'I was terrified of being on the other end of the phone as Mum slowly drowned'",
