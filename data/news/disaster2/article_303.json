    "text": "LEHIGHTON, Pa. â€” Not much is left of a home on North 1st Street in Lehighton. Thursday night, flames ripped through the home and spread to another home next door. \"It was scary,\" said Konner Nalesnik. \"I saw the smoke, and obviously, anytime a fire happens, you're praying for the family, but when it's someone you know, it's different.\" Nalesnik says the home that caught fire belongs to the family of one of his wrestling teammates. They were not home when the fire broke out. \"I care about the team and others before me, so knowing I have teammates in need, so I was quick to jump the gun and get some stuff together, and make sure they are alright and have the things they need because they don't have anything at all.\" Lehighton Fire Chief Pat Mriss says between the damage of the two homes, eight people are now left without a place to live. The Lehighton Takedown Club has started a donation drive for the families. \"This rivals up with one of the biggest ones in my career that we've seen in the borough,\" Chief Mriss said. Chief Mriss says battling this fire in the extreme heat was no easy task. Neighbors and businesses were quick to step in to help. \"The community support, they came out. They brought water. They brought food. The support, it didn't go unnoticed,\" the chief said. \"You always talk about everyone knows each other in a small town but when something like this happens, you see that camaraderie, everyone coming together and caring for each other,\" Nalesnik added. A state police fire marshal is investigating the cause of the fire. A GoFundMe page has been set up to help the victims.",
