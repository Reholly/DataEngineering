[ANI](/ani-stories)| Updated: 23-06-2024 22:23 IST | Created: 23-06-2024 22:23 IST - Country: - India Indian Army engineers from Trishakti Corps constructed a 150-foot suspension bridge in North Sikkim to re-connect the border villages that got cut off due to continued heavy rains, giving respite to the locals living in those locations, the army said on Sunday. Working under challenging conditions, the army engineers reaffirmed their technical proficiency by launching the foot suspension bridge over waters flowing at speeds over 20 knots in less than 48 hours, said the army in an official release. The bridge will now pave the way to re-establish connectivity to those areas and facilitate move of people and the provision of relief material to the locales inhabiting the area. The Indian Army remains steadfast in its commitment to ensuring the safety and wellbeing of the people living in border areas, the army said.
