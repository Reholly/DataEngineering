    "text": "Two people found themselves stranded after flipping their kayaks while traversing the rapids beneath the Green Peter Dam on Saturday, June 22. Around noon, first responders were alerted to the two kayakers in danger, according to a news release from the Sweet Home Fire District. The kayakers were traveling downriver when water levels suddenly began to rise from a dam release, the release states, noting the increased water flow made the rapids much stronger, and the kayakers lost control in the surge. The two people swam to shore but were trapped on an outcrop of rock between the water and thick brush and briars at the base of a steep hillside, according to the release, which states Sweet Home Fire located the pair around 200 feet down an embankment. A lowering system was created so rescuers could safely reach the stranded kayakers while clearing the heavy vegetation with a machete, the release states. When the kayakers were reached, it was determined they were shaken but uninjured, and they were assisted up the embankment. People are also reading… “This is a good reminder that Green Peter Dam routinely lets water out which can quickly and drastically change the condition of the river below it,” the release states. “Be prepared with proper safety equipment and plan accordingly when enjoying our local waterways.”",
