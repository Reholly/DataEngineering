    "text": "Leon County unemployment rate dropped in May despite devastating tornadoes Big Bend and Florida unemployment rates remain below the national average TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (WCTV) - Florida- and the Big Bend- remain ahead of the nation as a whole when it comes to unemployment rates, [according to data released Friday by Florida Commerce.](https://lmsresources.labormarketinfo.com/library/releases/arearelease_region5.pdf) The statewide unemployment rate sat at 3.3% in May 2024, ahead of the U.S. rate of 4% for the same time frame. While nearly every county in the Big Bend has an unemployment rate below the national average, each county saw a slight increase in its unemployment rate compared to May 2023. Hamilton County checked in with the highest unemployment rate in the Big Bend with a 4% mark, while Wakulla County earned the lowest mark, sitting at 2.6%. [Despite devastating tornadoes on May 10 ](https://www.wctv.tv/2024/06/09/monday-marks-one-month-since-triple-twisters-tore-through-leon-county/)that destroyed numerous homes and businesses, Leon County’s unemployment rate sat at 3.2% for May, slightly lower than the month before. More Tallahassee news: CareerSource told WCTV there may be several factors in play to explain why the unemployment rate did not rise following the disaster. Those factors include “the economic resilience of the community and the community’s efforts to quickly stabilize the impacted local businesses.” CareerSource also observed that “the storm’s aftermath inadvertently led to an increase in job opportunities” due to a surge in demand for construction workers, contractors, and related professions. Florida Commerce reported Tallahassee’s metro area- which makes up Leon, Wakulla, and Gadsden Counties- outpaced the rest of the state in several industries. Tallahassee’s information industry gained over 300 jobs in May, more than any other region in Florida. The information sector saw a 7.5% annual job growth rate in May, while the Trade, Transportation, and Utilities industry saw a 7% jump. Both marks were the best in Florida for May. A Florida Commerce spokesperson told WCTV Friday that the state’s robust economy helped keep unemployment low, as well as the emergency bridge loan made available to businesses in the tornadoes aftermath. Florida Commerce said more than $1.3 million in bridge loans was awarded to local business owners in the six weeks since the storm. According to CareerSource Capital Region, the [ top six advertised jobs in the area](https://www.floridajobs.org/economic-data/hwol/local-workforce-development-areas) for May included registered nurses, retail salespersons, secretaries and administrative assistants, retail sale supervisors, customer service representatives, and computer occupations.
