Notes on Rural Assistance Payments: Eligibility: The eligibility for a Rural Assistance Payment depends on the income of the farmer or grower and their partner (excluding income from their farming business), as well as any money or off-farm assets they have. More Information: More details on Rural Assistance Payments can be found on the MSD website.
