    "text": "SATURDAY night’s 6.2 magnitude earthquake that shook most of Trinidad and was felt as far north as St Lucia and as far south as Guyana had many people thanking God on social media that it could have been much worse.\nThe earthquake was neither the longest nor the strongest but depending on where you live, the topography of the land and even the design of one’s house, it could result in one experience being different from the other.\nThere were electricity outages reported in west Trinidad but apart from hairline cracks to the outer wall plastering of some homes and buildings in central Trinidad, there was not much damage reported.\nThe Express reached out to the director of Seismic Research Centre at The University of the West Indies, St Augustine, Dr Erouscilla Joseph about the earthquake.\nShe reported the quake began at 11.58 p.m. and lasted between 30 to 33 seconds, had a depth of 46km and originated north of Carupano, Venezuela which, according to Joseph, is almost in line with Trinidad’s north coast or 97 kilometres directly west of Port of Spain.\nThe last powerful earthquake felt in Trinidad was back on August 21 2018. That quake had a magnitude of 6.9 on the Richter Scale and lasted 90 seconds.\nDr Joseph said in Santa Cruz, where she lives, the quake was quite intense but still there was little to no damage reported where she was.\nShe reported however that in Chaguanas and Couva, there were some hairline cracks reported to the outer plastering of some newly-constructed homes. She explained that “newer buildings where the foundation had not yet naturally settled,” there may be some cracks to the plastering outside but no major damage to these structures.\nOn social media many responded to the Express’ first story on the earthquake which appeared on the paper’s social media site minutes after the late night shake-up.\n“Williamsville...was strong to wake me up from sleeping,” one man posted.\n“Penal, very strong, the ceiling lights were swaying and I knew it was over a 6. The entire house was swaying a lot and last for a while,” one woman posted.\n“I felt it, I was awake, let’s not panic, Our Father Almighty is in control he will take us through, believe in him. In Jesus name amen,” another woman posted.\nRespondents from all over Trinidad including Port of Spain, Diego Martin, Carenage and Glencoe complained of violent shaking.\nPeople from Maracas Valley, St Joseph, El Dorado, Tunapuna, Arima and as far east as Sangre Grande also reported being awakened.\nCentral Trinidad was not spared with shaking reported in Chaguanas and Couva while south Trinidad also reported shaking in San Fernando, Marabella and Princes Town.\nNo damage to RHAs\nThe Regional Health Authorities all over Trinidad reported no damage to their facilities which indicated that no part of the island was spared.\nAccording to the North West Regional Health Authority (NWRHA) there was no damage reported at the Port of Spain General Hospital, the St James Hospital, the St Ann’s Hospital as well as 26 other smaller facilities that fall under their purview.\n“Our facilities have sustained no structural or operational damage in the aftermath of last evening’s earthquake, measuring magnitude of 6.2 struck at approximately 11.58 p.m.” the NWRHA stated in a release.\n“All emergency protocols were promptly activated to ensure the safety and well-being of patients and staff. Thanks to these measures and the dedication of our committed team, all hospital services continue to be available without interruption,” the Authority added.\nThe South West Regional Health Authority (SWRHA) reported similar findings with the San Fernando General Hospital having no reports of damage. Other health facilities in the south west area also reported no damage.\nThe North Central Regional Health Authority where the Eric Williams Medical Sciences Complex, Mt Hope is located also reported no signs of damage while other faculties also reported no damage.\nThe Eastern Regional Health Authority (ERHA) also reported no damage to their facilities as well, and like all the other authorities their services yesterday were not interrupted.\nAccording to the ERHA “initial damage assessments were conducted at our facilities and reports confirmed no damage to building and equipment at this time and the ERHA Disaster Co-ordinating team will continue to monitor the situation.”\nAfter Saturday night’s quake several areas in Trinidad including Glencoe, Cocorite, Carenage and Bamboo No. 2 reported power outages.\nAccording to an unnamed official at the Trinidad and Tobago Electricity Commission power was restored within minutes in some areas while in other areas power took as much as an hour to be restored.",
