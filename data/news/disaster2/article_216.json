    "text": "Awards recognize NYSEG and RG&E and CMP’s exemplary recovery efforts following extreme winter storms this past year\nView and download photos from these storms here\nAvangrid, Inc. (NYSE: AGR), a leading sustainable energy company and a member of the Iberdrola Group, announced today that it has received dual Emergency Response Award from Edison Electric Institute (EEI). The awards honor the extraordinary performance of Avangrid companies New York State Electric & Gas (NYSEG) and Rochester Gas and Electric (RG&E) and Central Maine Power (CMP) during recovery and restoration efforts from winter storms this past year.\nThis press release features multimedia.

We do this critical work well because electricity is an essential service that our customers rely on.”\nPresented to EEI member companies twice a year, the Emergency Response Awards recognize recovery and assistance efforts of electric companies following service disruptions caused by extreme weather or other natural events. Following an international nomination process, EEI announced the Avangrid companies as recipients during EEI 2024.\nNYSEG and RG&E were honored for their response to Winter Storm Finn, which struck New York state in January 2024. Winter Storm Finn brought high winds to upstate New York, causing outages in the NYSEG’s Geneva, Auburn, Lancaster, Mechanicville, and Ithaca divisions, and snapping poles and bringing down trees in RG&E’s Central and Fillmore divisions as well.\n“Our customers count on us to be first responders during New York’s sometimes wild weather, restoring power safely, effectively, and as quickly as possible,” said Trish Nilsen, president and CEO of NYSEG and RG&E. “Our commitment to our customers, our communities, and operational excellence are recognized by this award, but this critical work is a priority for us because electric and natural gas service is something they rely on.”\nCMP was honored for its response to a strong wind and rainstorm on December 18, 2023. This extreme storm prompted CMP to mount the largest restoration effort in the company’s history after 400,000 of its customers lost power over the duration of this weather event. The company ultimately restored power on Christmas Eve.\n“In Fairfield, Maine alone, thousands of trees fell, requiring what was essentially a street-by-street rebuild of the town’s electrical system,” said Joe Purington, CMP President and CEO. “In moments of crisis such as these storms, Mainers can count on us to be first responders and to restore power safely, effectively, and as quickly as possible.\nAbout Avangrid: Avangrid, Inc.
