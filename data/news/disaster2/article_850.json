    "text": "Quick action by neighbors using a garden hose Sunday night helped prevent a fire involving a propane gas-powered cooking grill from spreading to a Loyalsock Township home just a few feet away, according to investigators.\nThe fire at the rear of 1035 Canterbury Road ignited shrubbery and the siding of a shed before it was stopped with the garden hose and a volunteer firefighter with a portable extinguisher who arrived on the scene in minutes after the fire was dispatched at 8:22 p.m.\nThe fire was out completely in seven minutes.\nFirefighters from the township, the city and Montoursville worked together to douse all hot spots.\nInvestigators have ruled the fire accidental. The grill was used earlier in the day, and it was believed that a build up of heat ignited the grill cover once it had been placed over the unit, investigators said.\nFire damage was limited to the siding of the shed, fire officials.\nA neighbor captured this photo Sunday night of burning shrubbery at the back of a home on Canterbury Road. Firefighters douse hot spots following a fire sparked by a outdoor grill. A firefighter showers a propane tank with water minutes after the tank was yanked from an outdoor grill that caught fire Sunday night.",
