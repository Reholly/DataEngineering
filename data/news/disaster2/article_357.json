    "text": "TEMPLE, Texas â€” Saturday, June 22 will mark one month since two tornadoes touched down along West Adams and Heidenheimer. An EF2 and EF1 blew through Central Texas homes on [May 22](/article/weather/severe-weather/nws-confirms-ef-2-tornado-temple-texas/500-ef7db111-0a6d-4e72-8b5b-f6f48ee8e9bchttps://www.) leaving the community in devastation. Hundreds of homeowners are still working to rebuild like Joely Lux. She has lived in Temple for 19 years. She wasn't home when the tornado hit, but when she came back, she saw water everywhere. Along with that, her roof and fence were both gone. Now a month later, she says it's been quite the adjustment. She is staying in a hotel with her family and 110-pound boxer in a one-bedroom suite working remotely. \"Never in a million years did we think it would come straight down this part of town,\" Lux said. A couple miles outside of Temple lives Jeramy Snowden, who lives in Heidenheimer. His home was hit with an EF1 tornado the same day. \"300,000 volt power lines across our yard,\" Snowden said. \"We were just devastated. Couldn't get in. We had to cut trees to get into the house.\" Both left with homes unrecognizable. May 22 is a day those in Temple will never forget. \"When we came through that night, it just made me cry,\" Lux said. \"Honestly, I'm going to cry talking about it, but it's just the loss.\" What's kept the community strong is people like Diego Gutierrez. \"We're out here trying to take care of some of these damages with these houses on the roof behalf and fence,\" Gutierrez said. \"It's been quite a disaster.\" He works with the Spartan Elite Group, who have been hard at work helping those affected get back on their feet. \"I think in the past two weeks, we've done probably 20 roof jobs and at least 35 fence jobs,\" Gutierrez said. \"We've been out here busting our tails.\" The last month has been quite the adjustment for several homeowners like Lux. She won't even have a roof until July 11, but she's keeping her head held high and she hopes others can too. \"We'll get through this, and we'll build stronger,\" Lux said. If you still need help from the severe storms, FEMA's disaster recovery center is open at Tarver Elementary School in Temple every day from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. The agency has $102 million dollars in grants to help victims throughout the state.
