    "text": "WASHOUGAL — Tia Robertson eyed the ladder perched on the side of the eight-story building with a mixture of trepidation and exhilaration. On one hand, she is terrified of heights; on the other, she is loath to turn away from a good-natured goading. So up the ladder she went. “At first I was going to do it without my gear,” said Robertson, a Washougal city councilor. “But (one of the firefighters) said, ‘I dare you,’ and I’m like, ‘Ah, he knows me. I cannot pass on a dare.’” So the pack went back on. “(Firefighters) have got to do it. They don’t have a choice. And the job of that firefighter is not just making up the ladder; their job is to do what’s at the top of the building,” she said. Robertson overcame her fears to complete the exercise, part of Fire Ops 101, an annual event put on by the Washington State Council of Firefighters to provide firefighting training to elected officials and media members. The training offers perspective on how crews operate and the challenges that firefighters face on the job.",
