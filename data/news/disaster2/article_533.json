    "text": "UAE Allocates $5Mln in Humanitarian Aid to Sudan, UAE Foreign Ministry Says Subscribe MOSCOW (Sputnik) - In April, at the International Humanitarian Conference for Sudan and Neighbouring Countries, the UAE committed to providing $100 million to Sudan via UN agencies. Last week, the UAE Foreign Ministry said that 70% of the pledged sum had been allocated. \"The United Arab Emirates has signed an agreement with the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) to allocate USD 5 million to support the Sudan Humanitarian Fund (SHF),\" the ministry said in a statement on Friday. The UN undersecretary for humanitarian affairs, Martin Griffiths, was quoted as saying that \"with this allocation, we can bolster our [lifesaving support](https://en.sputniknews.africa/20240618/blinken-saudi-foreign-minister-discuss-action-to-end-sudan-war-us-state-department-says-1067092880.html)to families and communities caught up in Sudan's unprecedented humanitarian crisis.\" On April 15, 2023, clashes broke out between the Sudanese army and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).
