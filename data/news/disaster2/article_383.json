    "text": "Share Share Video Link copied! Rodriguez (0-2) yielded five runs (four earned) on two hits and three walks over 1.1 innings Friday, striking out one batter and taking a loss against the Guardians.\nRodriguez began his outing with a scoreless inning before Cleveland racked up seven runs in the second frame. It was his first appearance since April 29 due to a back injury. His season ERA jumped from 4.11 to 5.94 through 16.2 innings. The 27-year-old righty is currently lined up for his next appearance in Boston next week. Rodriguez has yet to complete more than four innings in a start this season.\nMore News Blue Jays' Yariel Rodriguez: Reinstated to start Friday 12H ago • by RotoWire Staff Blue Jays' Yariel Rodriguez: Could start Friday 4D ago • by RotoWire Staff Blue Jays' Yariel Rodriguez: Set to return from IL this week 4D ago • by RotoWire Staff Blue Jays' Yariel Rodriguez: One more rehab start 7D ago • by RotoWire Staff Blue Jays' Yariel Rodriguez: Poised to return this weekend 9D ago • by RotoWire Staff Blue Jays' Yariel Rodriguez: Next rehab start coming Tuesday 11D ago • by RotoWire Staff Our Latest Fantasy Baseball Stories Week 14 sleeper hitters Scott White • 1 min read Week 14 sleeper pitchers Scott White • 1 min read Week 14 two-start SP rankings Scott White • 1 min read What to watch this weekend Chris Towers • 8 min read Prospects Report: Baz back to form Scott White • 11 min read Thursday's waiver wire Chris Towers • 4 min read",
