    "text": "A luxury cruise ship rescued 68 migrants attempting to reach the Spanish Canary Islands in a fishing boat that had stalled in rough seas, as reported by Spanish authorities and the cruise operator on Thursday, June 20.\nTragically, 6 individuals perished in the incident.\nThe Canary Islands have become a primary entry point for migrants from Africa attempting to reach Spain, with this route being notably perilous. Migration rights group Walking Borders reported last week that ~5,000 migrants died at sea on this route during the first 5 months of 2024.\nThe bulk carrier Philipp Oldendorff initially sighted the adrift boat 440 nautical miles (815 km) south of\nTenerife on Wednesday, June 19, providing initial assistance to the migrants. The Insignia cruise ship was then diverted to the area to rescue the survivors, according to a statement by the Spanish Coast Guard.\nThe Insignia, operated by\nMiami-based Oceania Cruises, also recovered 3 bodies from the boat. Due to adverse weather conditions, the recovery of another two bodies was not possible, so a locating device was left to aid in their retrieval.\nThe Insignia, a small luxury cruise ship with a capacity of 670 passengers, is currently on a 180-day\nworld voyage that commenced in January.\nFor more Oceania Insignia incidents and accidents see the ship's\nCruiseMinus page.",
