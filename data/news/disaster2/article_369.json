The crash occurred just after 4 p.m. on westbound 215, west of Jones Boulevard. (Victoria Hoang) Yuhas knew he caught back up to the black vehicle by the billowing smoke seen over the center median of the same color. NSP said the SUV collided head-on with another vehicle that then overturned and struck a car. Those two other vehicles caught fire.\nYuhas, safe on the other side, felt compelled to pull over.\n“The driver was yelling for help, and so I instantly jumped over the barrier without really thinking about it,” Yuhas said. “You see stuff like this on TV and you don’t relate with it until you’re right there in that moment.”\nTwo people died after a wrong-way crash in the northwest Las Vegas area Thursday afternoon, according to police. (Victoria Hoang) He joined others helping distressed drivers to safety, or at least those they could safely reach amidst scorching flames that other drivers captured on video. Collectively, Yuhas said they removed the driver of one of the cars on fire off the freeway.\n“He had the gash on his forehead. I think his nose was broken. (His) back was all burnt from the fire in his vehicle,” Yuhas said. “He was having kind of a hard time even processing (what had happened) as he got out.”\nOf the three adult male drivers, this is the only one that survived. NPS, in a release on Friday, corrected incorrect information it provided on Thursday, saying the wrong way driver and one of the cars he hit both died on the scene.\nTwo people died after a wrong-way crash in the northwest Las Vegas area Thursday afternoon, according to police. The crash occurred just after 4 p.m. on westbound 215, west of Jones Boulevard. (KLAS) Wrong-way driver calls are leaving state troopers strained, according to NPS Public Information Officer and Trooper Shawn Haggstrom, who are unable to follow these drivers to stop them as they typically do for other reckless driving reports. He says the reporting calls typically do not come in until moments before the crash happens.\n“You usually can’t ask the driver what they were thinking because they’re dead by the time you guys get there, right?” 8 News Now Reporter Ryan Matthey asked during a virtual interview Friday, to which Haggstrom confirmed.\nThe charred portion of the 215 Northern Beltway on Friday, June 21, 2024, that Nevada State Police said was where a wrong-way driver collided with others before combustion on Thursday. (KLAS) The agency gets slight assistance from wrong-way driving technology, which includes flashing “wrong way” signs on the freeway and interstate off-ramps that detect when a car enters from the wrong way and send video to first responders. There are only four locations in the Vegas Valley that have them, and Thursday’s wrong-way driver likely did not encounter any of them.\nThe Nevada Department of Transportation expects to enhance more exit ramps along U.S. 95 from the Spaghetti Bowl around the Rainbow curve later this year, though widespread installation valley-wide is likely years away.\n“It’s very intense for us because we don’t know what’s going to happen,” Haggstrom said.\nFor those like Yuhas, the bone-chilling experience may never be forgotten, unless he’s no longer required to drive this portion of freeway every day. It’s the fastest way to his job and family, he says.\n“It felt cold outside in that moment, and it was like over 100 degrees,” Yuhas said. “It’s scary to know that I am going to get on that road five times a week and that could happen at any moment.”\nLas Vegas driver Ron Yuhas Haggstrom told 8 News Now that a majority of wrong-way crashes happen from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. and on weekends. To best protect yourself from a wrong-way driver, he suggests:\nScanning the upcoming road 10 to 15 seconds ahead of reaching it At night, avoid traveling in the lane closest to the median where a majority of these crashes happen Utilize headlights and seatbelts Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc.
