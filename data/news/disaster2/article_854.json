On Monday, the ministry, in collaboration with local and national agencies, will survey the area to develop improvement strategies, including installing water level meters at the Da Qingshui River (大清水溪) railway bridge within a month.\nThe MOTC announced that the debris warning system should be operational by July 22, with additional CCTV cameras set for 24-hour monitoring. Plans are also underway to enhance landslide and debris flow barriers and alarms throughout the region, including the Pingxi Line.\n更多 TVBS 報導\nMOTC head: Tainan railway project set for 2026 completion",
