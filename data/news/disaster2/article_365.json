    "text": "By Ward Clark | 8:54 PM on June 21, 2024 The opinions expressed by contributors are their own and do not necessarily represent the views of RedState.com. \"Man's best friend. (Credit: Unsplash/Christopher Paul High)\nWhen life gives you the chance to do the right thing, you have to be down for the moment. When 38 - yes, you read that right - 38 hound dogs were spotted floundering in the middle of Mississippi's Granada Lake, insurance agent Bob Gist, and his buddy Brad Carlisle, along with their fishing guide Jordan Chrestman, were equal to the task.\nAdvertisement Leaving the fish for the moment, they steered their boat to the water-treading hounds and hauled them to shore, all 38 of them, saving them from a watery grave. Not a single pooch was lost :\nBy the time fishermen spotted the first head bobbing above the water, the 38 dogs were exhausted and struggling to stay alive.\nThe hound dogs had plunged into a large Mississippi lake while chasing a deer, a diversion during a fox hunt. Bob Gist, who was fishing on the lake, knew they had no chance.\n“A deer can swim the Mississippi River, and those dogs are not going to catch a deer in the water,” he recalled Friday.\nThey weren’t going to survive, either, Gist and the others realized — unless someone acted right away. The insurance agent from Jonesboro, Arkansas, along with friend Brad Carlisle and guide Jordan Chrestman, headed over in their small boat.\n“There were dogs everywhere,” Gist said. “They were kind of swimming in circles and didn’t know which direction to go.”\nDeer are indeed good swimmers; it's not unknown for them to take to the water to avoid predatory pursuit. And, to be perfectly candid, most hound trainers I've known go to great lengths to train their dogs not to chase deer. Even the best dogs will break training now and then, though, and in a pack, if one does so, it can cascade through to the others. But once these hounds had followed the deer into the lake, they were in trouble:\nAdvertisement As the dogs’ frantic owners watched from the shore, the three men started grabbing whatever dogs they could. There were too many to all fit on the bass boat, so three trips to shore were needed.\nA photo Gist took during the rescue shows Carlisle standing and grinning in mirrored sunglasses, with more than a half-dozen of the hound dogs perched on the bow. Numbers from the fox hunt are painted on their sides.\n38 dogs were close to drowning on a Mississippi lake. But some fishermen had quite a catch https://t.co/RhIWVPeNVj pic.twitter.com/iqq4zO53pq\n— WHLT 22 Hattiesburg (@WHLT22) June 21, 2024 Kudos all around!",
