    "text": "Sylhet, June 20 -- State Minister for Water Resources Ministry Zahid Faruk on Thursday said the government will take steps to dredge the Surma River to protect Sylhet city from early floods. The construction work of nine dredging stations across the country is underway and steps will be taken for dredging of the Surma River soon, he said while talking to reporters after visiting the Shaadi Canal in Tukerbazar area of Sylhet city on Thursday. Water from upstream brings silt that obstructs the normal flow of the river, said the minister adding, &quot;We have talked to the engineers that the dredging of the Surma River will begin soon.&quot; All necessary steps will be taken to deal with the flood situation, he said. Sylhet City Corporation Mayor Md Anwaruzzaman Chowdhury, official concerned of Sylhet Water Development Board and local administration were present there.
