    "text": "Chickasaw Nation to help Sulphur, Marietta rebuild from storms ADA, Okla. (KXII) - The Chickasaw Nation plans to help two Oklahoma communities rebuild after being hit by severe weather. Chickasaw Nation Governor Bill Anoatubby announced a fundraising initiative Thursday called the Business Rebuild and Recovery Campaign. The campaignâ€™s goal is to help Sulphur and Marietta businesses recover from storm damage, according to [a press release](https://www.chickasaw.net/News/Press-Releases/Release/Chickasaw-Nation-Unveils-Bold-Initiative-to-Help-R-62475.aspx) from the Chickasaw Nation. The Chickasaw Nation has made a substantial financial contribution toward the $6 million fundraising goal. In Marietta, the project will focus on fixing damage caused by the tornado that [ripped through the town](https://www.kxii.com/2024/04/28/fatal-tornado-rips-through-marietta-destroying-multiple-buildings/) in April. In Sulphur, an architecture firm will be used to preserve the historic look of the downtown area, [which was also destroyed](https://www.kxii.com/2024/04/29/deadly-tornado-destroys-sulphur-downtown-leaving-30-people-injured/). The Business Rebuild and Recovery Campaign also plans to create a grant program to fund the costs of the design and construction of damaged businesses, according to the press release. The campaign has not yet released information on how affected businesses can apply for grants. Copyright 2024 KXII. All rights reserved.",
