    "text": "Ca Mau, the southernmost province of Vietnam, has passed a decision to establish a 27,000-hectare marine reserve to protect and conserve aquatic resources, protect the environment and ecosystem, and promote sustainable eco-tourism development, the Office of the provincial People’s Committee said on Friday. This marine protected area will include a 9,000-hectare buffer zone, a 3,000-hectare no-take zone, a 11,230-hectare zone for habitat restoration, and an administrative area spanning 3,970 hectares. The marine reserve is expected to help shield rare and endangered species from extinction and protect threatened species with high economic and scientific values. With the establishment of the marine reserve, local authorities look to protect marine biodiversity, achieve sustainability in tourism development, improve the livelihoods of local inhabitants, and encourage the public to deeply engage in marine biodiversity conservation and development. The southernmost province elaborated that it wants to protect some major natural ecosystems such as coral reefs in Chuoi and Hang Islands, keep the biodiversity and unique natural beauty of Khoai, Da Bac, and Chuoi Islands intact in order to serve scientific research, education, eco-tourism, adventure tourism, and wellness tourism purposes. These islands are off the province’s Tran Van Thoi District.
