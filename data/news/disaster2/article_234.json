    "text": "A group of five abandoned animals found themselves in grave danger in Vovchansk, Ukraine, as enemy fire closed in around them. They were poised for a quick escape with a PETA-supported rescue team, but when the fighting intensified, they all quickly retreated to the basement of a destroyed house nearby. The team and the dogs and cats huddled together in the dark, narrowly escaping a missile strike. Watch as one among them, a dog named Justin—a visibly shaken older fellow—waits, embodying the plight of animals caught in the crossfire of human conflicts.",
