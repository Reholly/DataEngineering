    "text": "Mumbai: Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde announced on Friday that Mumbai's roads will be pothole-free within the next two years as ongoing concretisation efforts continue. Speaking at an event commemorating late Mumbai sheriff and esteemed jurist Nana Chudasama, Shinde urged city residents to collaborate with authorities in preserving Mumbai's cleanliness and beauty.Highlighting recent initiatives, Shinde mentioned a successful deep cleaning campaign that has notably reduced pollution levels. He emphasised that the comprehensive concretisation of Mumbai's roads is presently underway, aimed at achieving a pothole-free city by the coming years. Shinde noted the coordinated efforts between civic authorities, government agencies, and police to alleviate traffic congestion, with additional cleanliness drives underway across Mumbai's beaches.Addressing improvements in infrastructure, Shinde pointed out a decrease in traffic congestion in south Mumbai following the partial opening of the coastal road. He noted that this development has resulted in significant savings in time, money, and fuel for commuters.Shinde also stressed the importance of collective community effort in city development, stating that when individuals and organisations unite for Mumbai's progress, the pace of development and beautification accelerates.Mumbai crime branch summons chief BMC officer in Ghatkopar hoarding collapse caseThe Mumbai Crime Branch has summoned Gajanan Bellale, the chief BMC officer of the area of Ghatkopar East, in connection with the Ghatkopar hoarding collapse in Maharashtra.Seventeen people died and 74 were left injured in the incident that happened on May 13 amid strong winds and heavy rains in Mumbai.The crime branch has asked Bellale to appear for questioning today.Earlier on May 31, the Mumbai Sessions Court dismissed the anticipatory bail plea filed by Jhanvi Marathe, former director of Ego Media, in connection with the Ghatkopar hoarding collapse in Maharashtra.With PTI Inputs",
