We got him a sandwich and then carried him out to be reunited with Mom and Dad.”\nThe video also captured Ramirez being hugged by his father, as well as him eating his food and being wrapped in a jacket.\n“It was pretty clear that he had been lost and he had kind of hunkered down for the entire night,” Fresno County Sheriff’s Lt. Brandon Pursell told CNN affiliate KABC . “There’s a lot of things that could have gone really, really wrong with this one, and we got lucky, the family got lucky. The boy is very, very fortunate to be with his family.”\nMissing Houston Woman Found Safe 2 Weeks After She Disappeared on Morning Walk with Her Dog Authorities had previously reported that Ramirez went missing at Huntington Lake just before 11 a.m. on Thursday.\n“A family at the Rancheria Campground reported their 4-year-old boy was missing,” they stated at the time. “They had been searching for him about an hour before they called our department.”\nThe Fresno County Sheriff’s Search and Rescue team searched for Ramirez in the northeastern region of the lake alongside Forest Service rangers and officers from California Fish & Wildlife officers and an air support unit.",
