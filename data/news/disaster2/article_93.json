    "text": "Reasi: Indian Railways on Thursday conducted a successful trial run on the newly constructed Chenab Rail Bridge, the world's highest railway bridge.\nThe bridge is built between Sangaldan in Ramban district and Reasi. Rail services on the line will start soon, officials said.\nhttps://x.com/AshwiniVaishnaw/status/1803741379039986006\nMinister for Railways, Ashwini Vaishnaw, said in a post on X , \"Successful trial run of MEMU train between Sangaldan - Reasi section of USBRL project. Jammu & Kashmir\".\nAt present, the trains operate along the railway line from Kanyakumari to Katra, while services run from Baramulla to Sangaldan in the Kashmir Valley.\nThe Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla Rail Link (USBRL) project will be completed by year-end.\nThe USBRL project, including the 48.1 km long Banihal-Sangaldan section, was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on February 20, 2024.\nPhase I of the project, covering the 118 km long Qazigund-Baramulla section, was inaugurated in October 2009. Subsequent phases saw the inauguration of the 18 km long Banihal-Qazigund section in June 2013 and the 25 km long Udhampur-Katra section in July 2014.\nThe Chenab Rail Bridge, constructed 359 metres (around 109 feet) above the Chenab River in the Jammu and Kashmir region, is some 35 metres taller than the Eiffel Tower.\nThe 1,315 metre-long bridge is part of a broader project which aims to make the Kashmir valley accessible by the Indian Railway network.",
