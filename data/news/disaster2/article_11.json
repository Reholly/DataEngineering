    "text": "Mirage News Mirage News Mirage News National 21 Jun 2024 7:34 am AEST Date Time Share Enhancing Health Security Across Our Region The Hon Pat Conroy MP, Minister for International Development and the Pacific, Minister for Defence Industry Australia is investing in our region's shared health security, drawing on the lessons of COVID-19 to help us be better prepared for the next pandemic.\nWe are building a series of new partnerships to support our region to better prevent, detect and respond to health emergencies and infectious diseases.\nBuilding the capacity of our region's veterinarians supports rural livelihoods and reduces the risk of disease spillovers from animals into humans. A new $5 million partnership with a consortium led by the University of Sydney will improve training available for veterinary epidemiologists, supporting countries in our region to identify and better respond to disease outbreaks in animals.\nAn $11 million partnership with the Menzies School of Health Research will help to strengthen disease surveillance in partner countries in Southeast Asia, including greater support to monitor antimicrobial resistance, a serious global health threat.\nThe package also includes $16 million to support the development of new treatments for neglected tropical diseases through the Australian not-for-profit biopharmaceutical company Medicines Development for Global Health.\nThe new partnerships are part of the Australian Government's five-year Partnerships for a Healthy Region initiative, which is working with partner countries to build resilient, equitable and inclusive health systems.\nQuotes attributable to Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator the Hon Penny Wong:\n\"We are drawing on Australia's expertise to support our region to better prepare for, and respond to, health security threats including animal and human disease outbreaks.\n\"These new partnerships will support governments across the Pacific and Southeast Asia to build more resilient, effective health systems, which is critical to ensuring our shared prosperity and security.\"\nQuotes attributable to Minister for International Development and the Pacific, the Hon Pat Conroy MP:\n\"Australia's investment will support partners across the Pacific and Southeast Asia to ensure they have the right foundations in place to prepare for, and respond to, future disease outbreaks.\"\n/Public Release.

Mirage.News does not take institutional positions or sides, and all views, positions, and conclusions expressed herein are solely those of the author(s).View in full here . Why? Well, unlike many news organisations, we have no sponsors, no corporate or ideological interests. We don't put up a paywall â€“ we believe in free access to information of public interest.\nMedia ownership in Australia is one of the most concentrated in the world ( Learn more ). Since the trend of consolidation is and has historically been upward, fewer and fewer individuals or organizations control increasing shares of the mass media in our country. According to independent assessment, about 98% of the media sector is held by three conglomerates. This tendency is not only totally unacceptable, but also to a degree frightening).

It is a bumpy road with all sorties of difficulties.\nWe can only achieve this goal together. Our website is open to any citizen journalists and organizations who want to contribute, publish high-quality insights or send media releases to improve public access to impartial information.
