Speaking at the final handover ceremony, Linda Ndungu, Bolt Country Manager said the Kenya Red Cross Society, through its robust mechanisms, was able to mitigate the impact of the floods. “Bolt is thrilled to announce that, thanks to our dedicated riders, we have successfully reached our goal of raising 10 million shillings. The funds raised will support flood victims through our esteemed partner, the Kenya Red Cross Society. The response to the 'Flood Assist' category was overwhelming, allowing us to meet our target in just two weeks. \"This achievement highlights the unwavering commitment of Kenyans to support each other in times of crisis, an incredible testament to our resilience as a nation. We commend the Kenya Red Cross for their outstanding work in aiding those affected by the floods and are confident that they will continue to make a positive impact as they help to restore lives,” said Ndungu Ndungu extended the company's appreciation to all users of its platform who contributed to this great initiative. How Kenya Red Cross and Bolt supported flood victims The Kenya Red Cross Society proactively prepared for these challenges by ensuring prompt emergency responses, conducting search and rescue missions, prepositioning shelter kits and distributing essential supplies. Kenya Red Cross Society Head of Disaster Operations Venant Ndighila expressed the society's deepest gratitude to Bolt for their generous contribution to supporting those affected by the floods. \"We appreciate not only the monetary donations but also the overall support from Bolt and the broader Kenyan community. With the initial contributions, we were able to help families regain their footing with dignity by providing food, clean water, emergency shelter, and attending to their health needs. \"Additionally, we supported affected children by purchasing school supplies, particularly in the Mai Mahiu region. Moving forward, we will continue to aid these families in improving their livelihoods and reconstructing their homes through cash support. We remain thankful for this partnership with Bolt, especially during a time when overall support has diminished due to challenging economic conditions..” Bolt's tax contribution to support flood victims The partnership between Bolt and the Kenya Red Cross Society to support flood victims across Kenya started in May 2024.
