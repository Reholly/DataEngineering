The new Dene KÇ«^ multi-purpose building, developed as part of the transformation of the area once occupied by the Lower Post Residential School, marks a significant milestone in the community's journey toward healing and reconciliation.\nThe new multi-purpose building is the latest addition to a series of significant community developments, including a recently opened water treatment facility and numerous new housing projects. These advancements collectively signify a period of growth and revitalization for the Daylu Dena Council and the Kaska people.\nQuotes \"The opening of this new multi-purpose building is a monumental achievement for our community of Lower Post and the Kaska people. It symbolizes our resilience and determination, marking a significant milestone in our journey towards healing and reconciliation after the closure of the Lower Post Residential School. This building stands not only as a physical structure but as a pillar of hope and healing, reflecting the reclaiming of our cultural heritage and fostering a vibrant future. It will serve as a beautiful space where Kaska culture can thrive, community bonds can strengthen, and our future generations can grow and prosper. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to the Government of Canada and the Government of British Columbia for their steadfast partnership and support in making this transformative project a reality.\"\nDeputy Chief Harlan Schilling , Daylu Dena Council\n\"Three years ago, my predecessors spoke of the ceremonial demolition of the Lower Post school. They looked forward to this day when the new multi-purpose building would be ready. I echo their words and hope that today's gathering is another step toward healing, and that this is a space where the community can feel welcomed and safe. We are committed to supporting communities like this one as they work towards healing and reconciliation.\"\nThe Hon. Gary Anandasangaree, Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations\n\"This new multi-purpose building represents our commitment to reconciliation, and our ongoing responsibility to address the legacy of residential school, while supporting Indigenous communities in their pursuit of a brighter future.
