    "text": "SAN DIEGO — This Saturday marks five months since historic flooding impacted thousands of people across San Diego. Many families are still living in a hotel through vouchers but those expire Friday. CBS 8 has been in touch with the [Banks family since they lost almost everything](/article/news/local/san-diego-family-gets-ready-to-move-back-into-their-home-four-months-after-flood/509-0784ef07-e472-4f90-a4f3-eff4d51379b5) on Jan. 22. CBS 8 has followed them throughout the process of rebuilding and dealing with red tape. A few days short of living in a hotel room for five months, Robert and Judi Banks are finally home. “Starting all over again. It’s going to be rough, but we’re going to make it,” said Judi Banks. There are new walls with fresh paint, new flooring and there’s an aroma of beans simmering in their new kitchen. “Look at that baby, home cooked foods. Whoo hoo,” said Judi. Behind the closet door is a green washer and dryer, which is Judi’s favorite color. “I had to have it,” said Judi. As they give CBS 8 a tour of their remodeled home you can see it’s the little things, like a new bathtub, that make starting over a little easier. It’s hard to imagine that their home could be fresh and new. In January their entire Mountain View neighborhood on South 42nd Street was under water during an unprecedented storm. “Officers walking down through the water, wading through the water, carrying rowboats,” said Robert Banks. The Banks’ say before the rain, they complained to the city several times to clean out the storm channel behind their house. Thursday, crews were seen repairing the fence, but the Banks' worry about the weeds that are already growing in the channel. “I can’t go back to another flood, I’ll make sure they keep it clean,” added Judi. After the storm water receded, the Banks' were allowed back into their home. But it was caked in mud and the walls were soaked from the storm's water. “If it had not been for the volunteers and someone out there that knew what to do immediately, we would still be like the rest of the people,” said Judi. Many of their neighbors have not been able to return to their homes or they refuse to leave their house and are living among possible mold infested walls. “We still have work to do. I’m going to support all I can,” said Judi. The Banks have flood insurance through FEMA, which helped, but they say the process was slow. “Money from FEMA is, I’m going to say it’s worse than slow. It’s worse than a snail,” said Robert. Federal money didn’t cover all the work to properly restore their home. The Banks wish the City would do more to rebuild. “I have to give credit to my sons, because they kept their finances, kept us going so we didn’t have to stop,” said Judi. The Banks say what helped them to keep going was to have faith in their new beginning. “God has always taken care of his people. We’re his people,” said Robert. Officials says the County of San Diego dedicated $4.2 million in financial support from the and the San Diego City Council authorized an additional $3 million to support those who need assistance and will continue to partner with the inspiring community members who are working to support storm victims. While the Banks couple is giving families hope, there are several dumpsters and barricades that still line the street. You can see there is still a long road to recovery. The hotel and food vouchers expire on June 21. A County spokesperson says at the peak there were 900 families using the food and hotel vouchers and offering mental resources. Today there are 348 still using the hotel vouchers. The County says local Housing Authorities will be working with families on temporary housing.
