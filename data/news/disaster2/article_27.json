    "text": "EL PASO, Texas (KFOX14/CBS4) — As the borderland mobilizes to provide supplies and support to the people affected and the crews fighting the Ruidoso wildfires, one man shared his story of how he is helping by rescuing horses. KFOX14/CBS4 caught up with self-described \"regular cowboy\" William Molinar outside a Walmart in far east El Paso, as he was loading crates of water bottles and Gatorade products into his truck. Molinar said he's taking the drinks to Ruidoso to hand them out to fire crews and first responders. However, this isn't Molinar's first trip. Since the disaster started, Molinar has taken around six to seven trips wrangling horses out of harm's way and reuniting them with their owners. “If I can make somebody's day better or an animal's life better then I'm able to do it. No matter if I have money or not I'm going to go out of my way to do it,” said Molinar. Transporting two to three horses at a time, Molinar said he has rescued a little over a dozen horses, placing them in safe nearby ranches or stables in Albuquerque and Sunland Park before reuniting them with their owners.

Molinar said they are sensitive creatures, requiring patience. “If you're calm and patient and trying to take care of them, make sure they’re okay, then they calm a little bit down, but yeah you have to be very careful and patient with these horses,” said Molinar. Molinar mission is a team effort, as he explained his trips have been fueled by donations. “Without El Paso, Las Cruces, Tularosa—everybody that donated I wouldn’t have done without them. So, my respects to them, without them, I can’t do this,” said Molinar. Molinar said he plans to continue to go on his horse-saving runs until donations dry out, adding that after the fires die down, he will ride around the area to wrangle stray horses that might still be roaming the area scared after surviving the South Fork and Salt fires.
