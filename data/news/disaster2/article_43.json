    "text": "SOME RAINFALL\\u00a0 \\u2014 long-awaited \\u2014\\u00a0 along with thunderstorms and light showers finally arrived in Kolkata and several districts of Bengal on Thursday afternoon, bringing relief from the heatwave-like conditions. Areas like Dumdum, Jadavpur, Behala, Dharmatala, New Town, Shobhabazar, Shyambazar, and Kasba experienced strong winds and scattered rain. However, the respite might be short-lived. The India Meteorological Department has forecast only scattered light to moderate rain over the next few days, with a slight drop in temperature in Kolkata till June 27. \\u201cLight to moderate rain with thunder for Kolkata from June 21-27. Additionally, expect a 2-3 degree Celsius drop in day temperature across Gangetic West Bengal over the next two days,\\u201d said the weather department. Monsoon will enter south Bengal in the next three-four days, the weather office further said. \\u201cThe monsoon has not set in yet. There is not much chance of rain. Scattered light to moderate rain may occur at some places. The temperature will also drop a bit in the next few days,\\u201d said an official from the weather department. Conditions are favourable for further advance of the monsoon into some parts of south Bengal and the remaining parts of Malda in the north during the next two to three days, it said. Meanwhile, the situation is different in north Bengal as the region has been experiencing heavy rainfall, raising flood concerns for many residents. The southwest monsoon advanced into most parts of north Bengal, the Met office said on Thursday, warning of heavy rain in the region over the next five days. It also forecast thunderstorms and lightning with gusty winds blowing at a speed of 30 to 40 km per hour in all districts of south Bengal during the next three days. The monsoon has already arrived in north Bengal, specifically reaching the Islampur area of North Dinajpur, IMD said, adding heavy to very heavy rainfall at one or two places over the districts of Alipurduar, Cooch Behar, Jalpaiguri, Kalimpong and Darjeeling in north Bengal over the next five days. Additionally, intense monsoon rains in Sikkim and north Bengal continued to cause floods in several areas on Wednesday. A total of 158 stranded tourists were rescued in North Sikkim and the last 100 tourists were brought to Gangtok. \\u2014 with PTI",
