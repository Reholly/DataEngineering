(Photo: Facebook/Sentosa) Work on clearing oil from the beaches' rock bunds and breakwaters has started. (Photo: Facebook/Sentosa) Since Friday, workers on Sentosa have started been clearing oil on rock bunds and breakwaters, said the resort island on Sunday, adding that it was a \"challenging and time-consuming task\".\n\"These areas are harder to access than the shoreline, with uneven surfaces and oil slipping into boulder crevices,\" it said.\nSentosa said that it is working with experts using specialised cleaning methods \"to thoroughly flush out the oil and clear it from the lagoon\".\nMinister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu said on Jun 20 that clearing the oil from the rock bunds and breakwaters would be a \"complex process\" .\n\"The rock bunds are not as accessible as beach shorelines and their surfaces are uneven. Oil that has slipped into the boulder crevices also needs to be thoroughly flushed out, and oil within the lagoon needs to be removed,\" she had said.\nVisitors to beachfront dining spots and attractions can still enjoy access to Sentosa's beaches, the resort island said on Sunday.\nCNA has contacted Sentosa for more information.\nRelated: Repairing snapped booms, treating oil-slicked sand: Oil spill clean-up efforts continue a week on Oil spill: Several beaches, including East Coast Park and Sentosa's Siloso, mostly cleared of oil Source: CNA/nh(rj) Sign up for our newsletters Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox\nSubscribe here Get the CNA app Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories\nDownload here Get WhatsApp alerts\nJoin our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app\nJoin here Related Topics oil spill Sentosa Sentosa Development Corporation Advertisement Also worth reading Content is loading...
