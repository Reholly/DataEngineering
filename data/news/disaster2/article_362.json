    "text": "MESA, Ariz. â€” Nick Reeves was down the street, showing a house in a neighborhood near Guadalupe and Sossaman in Mesa when he saw smoke in the air. Smoke that quickly grew larger. \"I went closer to it,\" Reeves said. \"Then it started getting really hot.\" With his cell phone camera rolling, Nick ran down the block to find fire erupting from the garage of a home into the driveway. Another bystander was already pounding on the glass. \"The garage appeared to be open,\" he said, \"Which indicates to me that someone was either just walking out or still in the home.\" No one answered or called out when they pounded on the door and window, but Nick said he wasn't sure everyone was out. The video shows Nick running to the side of the house, climbing the fence (in a suit) and jumping into the yard on the other side. He jogs down the side yard and toward a sliding glass door. Reeves said he saw dog droppings in the yard and thought a dog might be trapped inside. He said he opened the sliding door and the dog ran out. \"Obviously, he was shaken, scared,\" Reeves said. \"The explosions you can hear in the video were very loud.\" By that time, firefighters were on scene and took care of the dog. \"Adrenaline will do some crazy things that's for sure.\" He posted the video to Instagram, where some commenters called him a hero. Reeves said the firefighters who took care of the fire were the real heroes. \"I figured, if this was my house, I would want someone to do the same thing,\" he said.",
