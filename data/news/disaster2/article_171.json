    "text": "EL PASO, Texas ( KTSM ) – Texas Governor Greg Abbott has deployed Texas emergency management resources to New Mexico in response to the wildfires surrounding Ruidoso and flash flooding impacting the state, his office announced on Thursday, June 20. “As we continue to move through hurricane season, Texans are no strangers to the devastating effects of severe weather,” said Governor Abbott. “While the initial force of Tropical Storm Alberto dissipates, Texas was able to swiftly and effectively respond thanks to the critical work our state’s first responders and emergency response personnel do to protect and assist Texas communities. Today, I am deploying emergency management personnel to assist our neighbors in New Mexico as they face wildfire and flash flooding impacts. Texas will continue to work to ensure the safety and well-being of our communities across the state and of our fellow Americans.” At the direction of Gov. Abbott, the Texas Division of Emergency Management (TDEM) and Texas A&M Forest Service deployed emergency management personnel Thursday morning under the Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC), according to the Governor’s office. The Governor’s office said these personnel will support the State of New Mexico’s Emergency Operations Center in a variety of roles including the following: - Response operations - Planning - Logistics - Public information - Finance - Geographic information systems “The Emergency Management Assistance Compact is a state-to-state mutual aid system that enables states to provide assistance and share resources with another state in response to a disaster or emergency,” read the Governor’s office website. “EMAC members can share resources from all disciplines, protect personnel who deploy, and be reimbursed for mission-related costs.” For more information, visit emacweb.org .",
