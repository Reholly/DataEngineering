Ltd. and Quickinsure in an endeavor to bolster the E-WasteDrive. The shared goal of this partnership is to raise awareness, promote responsible e-waste disposal, and contribute to a cleaner, greener future.\nElectronic waste, or e-waste, poses a significant environmental challenge, with improper disposal leading to pollution, resource wastage, and potential health hazards. Recognizing the gravity of this issue, Innovative Environmental Technologies Pvt. Ltd. and Quickinsure are stepping forward to support IndiaAsha's dedicated efforts to address this critical concern.\nThe alliance between these two industry leaders and IndiaAsha(Asha Foundation) will encompass several key initiatives:\nE-Waste Collection Drives: Both Innovative Environmental Technologies Pvt. Ltd. and Quickinsure have actively encouraged their employees and customers to participate in e-waste collection drives organized by IndiaAsha(Asha Foundation). These drives will ensure that electronic waste is collected and disposed of responsibly, preventing it from ending up in landfills.\nAwareness Campaigns: A comprehensive e-waste awareness campaign will be jointly undertaken to educate the public about the hazards of improper disposal and the importance of recycling electronics. This campaign will utilize various media channels to reach a wider audience and drive behavior change.\nMr.Ashish V.Nawade, CEO at Innovative Environmental Technologies Pvt.
