    "text": "The Chicago White Sox will have a new left-handed option in the bullpen after signing reliever Tim Hill to a one-year, $1.8 million deal on Thursday, a source confirmed to the Tribune.\nThe team announced the deal Thursday afternoon. In the corresponding move, the Sox designated right-hander Declan Cronin for assignment.\nHill, 33, has a career 16-14 record with a 4.16 ERA and four saves in 320 games during six seasons with the Kansas City Royals (2018-19) and San Diego Padres (2020-23). He has 208 strikeouts and 84 walks in 255 1/3 career innings.\nLeft-handed hitters have a career .223/.302/.304 slash line against Hill.\nHill made a career-high 78 appearances in 2021, going 6-6 with a 3.62 ERA for the Padres. He was 1-4 with a 5.48 ERA in 48 outings in 2023. He missed most of the second half of the season with a sprained left finger that required surgery on Sept. 20.\nESPN’s Jeff Passan first reported the signing .\nAaron Bummer, Garrett Crochet, Tanner Banks and Sammy Peralta were among the left-handed relievers the Sox utilized in 2023. In November, the Sox traded Bummer to the Atlanta Braves for infielders Nicky Lopez and Braden Shewmake, right-handed pitcher Michael Soroka , left-hander Jared Shuster and minor-league pitcher Riley Gowens.\nCronin went 0-1 with a 9.00 ERA and eight strikeouts in nine outings for the Sox in 2023 . The team’s 40-man roster remains at 40.\n()",
