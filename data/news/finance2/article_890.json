    "text": "WINTER GARDEN, Fla. – The grand opening of The Peach Cobbler Factory in Winter Garden is set for Saturday.\nThe dessert restaurant announced the opening on social media Wednesday.\nThe store, located at 13848 Tilden Road , is set to open its doors at noon, according to its Facebook page.\nThe restaurant’s menu features 12 different kinds of cobbler, banana puddings, milkshakes and cookies, along with different varieties of cinnamon rolls, brownies, churros and Belgian waffles.\n[ ADD YOUR BUSINESS TO THE FLORIDA FOODIE DIRECTORY ]\nThe Winter Garden location had experienced some delays before announcing its opening. The delay was significant enough for the CEO of the company, Greg George, to take to social media and apologize.\nFind every episode of Florida Foodie on YouTube:\n“Today I come to the residents of Winter Garden and Orlando to personally apologize for the long wait on us getting our new dessert shop open in Winter Garden,” the post on Oct. 10 read. “The burden falls on me personally as things have not happened as fast as any of us had wanted. I wanted to apologize to everyone for the long wait and let you know.”\nThis is the second location of the chain in Central Florida. There is another location in Ormond Beach, according to the company’s website , with more locations planned in Winter Park, The Villages, New Smyrna Beach, Lake Buena Vista, Daytona Beach, Cocoa Beach and Cape Canaveral.\nThe chain is currently headquartered in Fort Lauderdale, but, according to the Courier Journal , it started as a food truck in Nashville in 2013.\nCheck out the Florida Foodie podcast. You can find every episode in the media player below:\nCorrection:\nA previous version of this story stated that the company was based in Louisville; however, its corporate headquarters moved to Fort Lauderdale within the last year. We apologize for the error and any confusion it may have caused.\nCopyright 2023 by WKMG ClickOrlando - All rights reserved.",
