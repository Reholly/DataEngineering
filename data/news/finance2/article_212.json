    "text": "Angela Tait, the visionary behind\nTait Consulting, is a transformative force in HR and recruitment. Her mission is to empower leaders, enabling them to reclaim their time and build their empire. Angela achieves this by helping them hire top talent, implementing strategic initiatives, and providing one-on-one business coaching to boost profitability.\nArmed with a Master’s in Organizational Development from Pepperdine University and a Society of Human Resource Management-Certified Professional certification (SHRM-CP), Angela brings a potent blend of education and real-world experience to her role as an HR expert. She also serves on the board of the Arizona Organization Development Network (AZODN), further solidifying her standing in the field.\nAmidst the challenges of a pandemic, Angela achieved a remarkable feat by spearheading the growth of a real estate company from 10 to 100 employees in just two years, elevating retention rates by an impressive 80%.\nAngela’s expertise has earned her recognition in esteemed publications like USNews, Authority Magazine, Buffalo News, and more. She lives in Phoenix, AZ, where she balances her thriving career with her cherished role as a wife and mother of two children.\nWhat is your typical day, and how do you make it productive?\nMy typical day is quite dynamic, but I’ve developed a routine that helps me stay productive and balanced. I kickstart my morning with a quick Peloton workout, ensuring I’m physically energized for the day ahead. Spending precious moments with my two boys in the morning is essential; it sets a positive tone for the day. My older son heads to pre-k, and the nanny takes care of my youngest, Oliver, giving me dedicated work time.\nI have a cozy office in my house, separate from the main living area, which allows me to maintain focus. In the morning, I dive into my inbox, attend to emails, and engage in writing tasks, which might include articles, social media posts, or progress on my upcoming book due by the end of 2023. I also manage meetings and follow up with potential candidates for open positions, all while advancing ongoing projects and addressing business development needs.\nIn the afternoon, I switch gears to pick up my son from school and cherish quality time with both my boys. The key to my productivity lies in a balanced approach: moving my body, actively pursuing my goals, and, most importantly, keeping my family, which is my top value, at the forefront of my daily priorities. This harmonious blend fuels my productivity and fulfillment throughout the day.\nHow do you bring ideas to life?\nBringing ideas to life involves a combination of collaboration and swift action. Here’s a breakdown of my process:\n1. Conceptualization: Start by brainstorming and generating ideas. This can be done individually or through collaboration with others. Group discussions often lead to a wider range of perspectives and creative solutions.\n2. Evaluation: Assess the feasibility and potential impact of each idea. Consider factors like resources required, time constraints, and alignment with goals or objectives.\n3. Planning: Once a viable idea is selected, create a detailed plan outlining the steps needed to execute it. Define roles and responsibilities if working with a team.\n4. Action: Don’t delay. Begin implementing my idea as soon as possible. Procrastination can lead to missed opportunities or diminished enthusiasm.\n5. Adaptation: Be open to adjusting the plan as I progress. Not every detail can be anticipated, and flexibility is key to overcoming unexpected challenges.\n6. Feedback: Continuously seek feedback from stakeholders, team members, or potential users. Their input can help refine the idea and make it even better.\n7. Persistence: The process of bringing an idea to life can be challenging. Staying committed, remain resilient in the face of setbacks, and keep refining and iterating as necessary.\n8. Celebration: When the idea reaches fruition, take a moment to celebrate success and acknowledge the efforts of those involved.\nBy combining collaboration with a bias toward action and adaptability, I can effectively bring ideas to life and turn them into tangible achievements.\nWhat’s one trend that excites you?\nThe trend of companies prioritizing employee well-being and development is indeed exciting. It’s a shift towards a more human-centric approach to work, and it has the potential to create a positive ripple effect not only within organizations, but also in society as a whole. When employees are happier, more engaged, and supported in their growth, they are likely to be more productive, creative, and innovative. This, in turn, can lead to more sustainable businesses and a better quality of life for individuals. It’s a trend that aligns with the idea that when people thrive at work, they contribute to a happier and more fulfilled world beyond the workplace, and that’s truly inspiring.\nWhat is one habit that helps you be productive?\nOne habit that helps me be productive is setting clear and prioritized daily goals. Each morning, I identify the most important tasks I need to accomplish and create a to-do list with a clear order of priority. This habit helps me stay focused and organized throughout the day, ensuring that I tackle the most critical tasks first and maintain a sense of accomplishment as I check them off my list.\nWhat advice would you give your younger self?\nThe advice to trust the process and have faith in the journey is valuable. Here’s a message to my younger self:\nDear Younger Self,\nTrust the process of life. There will be moments of uncertainty and challenges that may seem insurmountable, but remember that everything happens for a reason. The struggles and successes, the highs and lows – they all play a part in shaping who you become. Have faith that the path you’re on will lead to valuable lessons and opportunities for growth. Even when things don’t make sense at the moment, they will eventually fall into place. Embrace each experience as a stepping stone toward a brighter future.\nWith patience and perseverance, you’ll find your way. Keep believing in yourself, keep learning, and keep moving forward. The journey is as important as the destination, and it will all be worth it.\nSincerely, Your Wiser Self\nTell us something you believe almost nobody agrees with you.\nWhile the idea of waking up early is often associated with productivity, I believe that the optimal wake-up time can vary from person to person. Some individuals are naturally more productive during later hours, and it’s essential to align your schedule with your circadian rhythms and personal preferences. It’s not always necessary to wake up super early to be productive. The key is to find a routine that works best for you and allows you to maximize your productivity and overall well-being.\nThe habit of embracing discomfort and taking risks. Stepping outside your comfort zone is where personal growth and learning often occur. I recommend that everyone should make a conscious effort to get uncomfortable regularly. Challenge yourself, take risks, and put yourself in situations where you might face rejection or failure. It’s in these moments of discomfort that you discover your true potential, build resilience, and learn valuable lessons. Embracing discomfort is a powerful catalyst for personal growth and can lead to meaningful and transformative experiences.\nWhen you feel overwhelmed or unfocused, what do you do?\nWhen I find myself overwhelmed or struggling to focus, I turn to physical activity. Whether it’s a workout, dancing, or simply taking a walk, moving my body helps me reset and re-energize. It clears my mind, reduces stress, and allows me to return to my tasks with a renewed sense of focus and clarity. Physical activity is my go-to method for regaining balance and productivity when things get overwhelming.\nOne of the most impactful strategies that has propelled my career and business growth is prioritizing relationships. I’ve found that cultivating meaningful connections with others, both personally and professionally, can open doors and create opportunities that might not have been possible otherwise. I actively engage with my network by consistently sharing my business endeavors on social media platforms. This not only keeps my network informed about my work, but also encourages referrals and recommendations. In fact, the majority of my clients have come through referrals from friends, family, and connections within my network. By building and maintaining strong relationships, I’ve not only gained valuable clients, I have also established a reputation as someone trustworthy and reliable in my field. This strategy has driven business growth and enriched my career with a network of supportive individuals who continue to contribute to my success.\nA failure in my career has been underestimating my capability and my worth in previous roles that I took or turned down. One example is making a decision to give a role to someone less qualified due to personal reasons, resulting in taking a step down from a position I had worked hard to earn. From these experiences, I learned the importance of pausing, reflecting, and taking the time to carefully consider my decisions.\nI realized that quick, impulsive responses based on short-term benefits can sometimes lead to long-term setbacks. It taught me the value of a more deliberate and proactive approach to decision-making. I now prioritize looking at the long-term rewards and considering the impact of my choices on my career and personal goals. These failures served as valuable lessons in making decisions that align with my desired outcomes and contribute to my future success.\nWhat is one business idea you’re willing to give away to our readers?\nIf you’re seeking cost-effective support for your business, consider utilizing Handshake to find interns. It’s a win-win situation where you can offload tasks and provide valuable experience to someone in your field. Handshake is a platform used by colleges nationwide to connect current and alumni students with open positions.\nLinkedIn is a crucial software tool for me. I use it for networking in my business and also to identify potential candidates for roles I’m recruiting for clients.\nWhat is the best $100 you recently spent?\nI invested in a ticket to attend The Powerhouse Women event in Scottsdale, AZ. It provided valuable information, motivation in my business goals, reconnections with friends, and new connections with inspiring women in business, leading to valuable resources.\nI’ve gained significant value from “The Learning Leader Show” with Ryan Hawk due to its insightful and brilliant guest speakers. Additionally, “Buy Back Your Time” by Dan Martell has equipped me with valuable tools to scale my business and reclaim more time in my day.\nWhat’s a movie or series you recently enjoyed and why?\nThe recent movie, “Barbie” was enjoyable because it addresses women’s challenges and empowerment in a thoughtful way. Films that explore these themes can be not only entertaining, but also thought-provoking and inspiring. It encouraged important conversations and reflection on gender equality and feminism in society today.\nKey learnings:\n● Prioritizing relationships, both personal and professional, is a crucial driver of career and business success.\n● Embracing discomfort and taking calculated risks fosters personal growth and development.\n● Effective decision-making involves pausing, reflecting, and considering the long-term consequences of choices.\n● Utilizing online platforms like Handshake can provide cost-effective support for businesses through internships.\n● Engaging in physical activity, such as exercise or dancing, is an effective strategy to reset and regain focus when feeling overwhelmed or unfocused.\n ",
