    "text": "A classic winter sun destination , this Canary Island is a treat during the UK's coldest months, especially when you check into the best hotels in Gran Canaria.\nUp there with the best hotels in Tenerife , these stylish places to stay are perfect for escaping the icy UK weather, whether you're travelling solo, as a couple or looking for a family hotel.\nBEST HOTELS IN GRAN CANARIA\nFamous for its black and white sand beaches, dramatic lava landscapes and colourful Canarian villages, Gran Canaria is the third largest island in the Canaries' archipelago and the perfect spot to enjoy year-round sunshine.\nOnly 60 miles from the coast of North Africa, the island benefits from a balmy sub-tropical climate with average temperatures between 22 and 26 degrees. But, there's more to the island than fly-and-flop beach resorts. Nearly half the island is a UNESCO World Biosphere.\nHere, you can explore the rippling sand dunes of Maspalomas on the southern tip, go hiking around the volcanic flanks of Caldera de Bandama or stargaze at Roque Nublo, the island's famous rock formation in the very centre of the island. For history and culture, head to island capital Las Palmas and learn about Christopher Columbus' Canarian adventures in Casa de Col√≥n.\nFrom the historic boutique hotels in Vegueta, the historic old quarter of Las Palma, the swish beach resorts of Maspalomas to the colourful haciendas hidden in the hills of Tejedo, we've cherry picked the best hotels in Gran Canaria for 2024 and beyond.",
