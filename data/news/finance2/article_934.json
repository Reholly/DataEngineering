    "text": "Despite the economic challenges so many are facing, people still opened their hearts and their wallets to those who needed it most this holiday season.\nThe Shop of Wonders in Lethbridge was able to provide toys to more than 3,600 kids and 350 volunteers put in more than 5,000 hours of work to ensure families could receive a gift for Christmas.\nAnd the holiday cheer spread to the Lethbridge Salvation Army, with more than $128,000 raised as part of its Christmas Kettle campaign.\nThat money will provide support throughout the year for its food distribution program, along with the Toys for Tots campaign, which is part of the Christmas Hope project.\nA goal was set by six groups it partners with in Lethbridge to help over 10,000 people facing financial hardships.\nStory continues below advertisement “I would be willing to put ourselves out there and say that we’ve likely exceeded that just based on the demand that we have seen this year,” says Lt. Zach Marshall, community ministries officer with the Salvation Army.\n4:45 Salvation Army still trying to reach fundraising goal Meanwhile, the Calgary Food Bank has seen an unprecedented demand for help this season.\nGet the latest National news. Sent to your email, every day. Last year at this time the charity was helping serve over 400 households per day, but many more needed the support this year.\n“Today we will easily have 700 households coming to the Calgary Food Bank looking for food support,” says Melissa From, president & CEO of the organization.\n1:57 Lethbridge food bank use increasing as provincial food insecurity trends up And in Lethbridge, the food bank is seeing a similar demand with its largest need coming from single-family households. Food bank officials say they typically see a decline in donations once the ball drops on New Year’s Eve.\nStory continues below advertisement “We hope to get through the next few months here. We have a pretty good stock to get through as long as the numbers hold steady, we’ll be okay. We’re mostly worried if the numbers keep climbing after Christmas,” says Mac Nichol, executive director of the food bank.\n2:01 Lethbridge holiday campaigns are looking for donations this season The popular Angel Tree campaign also delivered gift bundles to 4,253 individuals up until Dec. 24 this year.\nFinal numbers for the Christmas Hope campaign will be released in January.\nRelated News ‘Sock It To ‘Em’ campaign supporting Lethbridge charities enters 23rd year Edmonton’s ‘Can Man Dan’ camping out in support of food bank once again",
