    "text": "Escalating geopolitical tensions are driving the profits of defense companies. Almost after two years, major defense corporations have shifted their stance significantly, with many anticipating robust demand in 2024. According to Reuters, on anticipation of aggressive actions from Russia and China, investments by the United States and its allies in costly weaponry and munitions is on an upsurge.\nOptimistic Market Outlook\nAccording to Wall Street estimates, as quoted on Reuters, shares of the largest defense companies are projected to continue their upward trajectory, beating the broader S&P 500 Index. The Dow Jones U.S. Select Aerospace & Defense Index and S&P Aerospace & Defense Select Industry Index have gained about 14.11% and 25.62%, respectively.\nPer the Reuters article, shares of Lockheed Martin\n[LMT](/market-activity/stocks/lmt), General Dynamics [GD](/market-activity/stocks/gd) and Northrop Grumman [NOC](/market-activity/stocks/noc) are estimated to climb 5-7% over the next 12 months.\nNorthrop Grumman and L3Harris Technologies\n[LHX](/market-activity/stocks/lhx), two primary U.S. rocket manufacturers have both reported an upsurge in demand, with Northrop attributing a significant portion of the rise in demand to the increased need for its rocket motors and warheads which see extensive use in Ukraine.\nRecord U.S. Defense Policy Bill\nOn Dec 22, President Joe Biden signed the U.S. defense policy bill that authorizes a record allowance of $886 billion in military spending, marking an increase of 3% in the nation's total national security budget.\nAccording to Reuters, the Defense bill also includes policies such as aid for Ukraine and push-back against China in the Indo-Pacific region. Such aids, in turn, are expected to usher in order flows for defense contractors, enhancing their potential for generating revenue.\nETFs in Focus\nThe escalating Middle East crisis has resulted in a surge in defense stocks driven by increased demand for military equipment. Persisting tensions between Russia and Ukraine further contribute to the volatility within the geopolitical landscape.\nThe U.S. defense market is valued at $613.18 billion in 2023 and is estimated to witness a CAGR of 0.67%, reaching a valuation of $646.83 billion by 2031, according to Mordor Intelligence.\nAgainst this backdrop, we highlight a few defense ETFs that can gain due to the complicated geopolitical landscape.\niShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA)\niShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF seeks to track the performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Select Aerospace & Defense Index with a basket of 35 securities.
