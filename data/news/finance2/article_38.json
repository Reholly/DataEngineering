    "text": "If your 9-5 job is mostly sedentary, you may find it hard to get your steps in daily. Enter the compact under-desk treadmill or, as some call, it the \\\"walking pad.\\\"\nWith the new year just around the corner, it's a great time to start thinking about new routines and this small change can yield great results.\nThere are tons of options for under-the-desk at-home folding treadmills at a variety of price points, all of which are easily stored or can even be brought into your office.\nWhile you answer emails, hop on a Zoom meeting or do any behind-screen tasks, you can also add in movement that will leave you feeling energized and closer to hitting your daily fitness goals.\nA few features that we think are important to keep in mind when choosing a walking pad are foldable handles, wheels for easy transport or storage, and different speed settings. These settings allow flexibility based on whether you want to run, jog or walk. The adjustable handlebar feature will give you more comfort and control.\nIt's time to lace up your walking shoes and get moving -- scroll below to shop!\nBy clicking on these shopping links, visitors will leave Goodmorningamerica.com.
