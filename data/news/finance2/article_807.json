    "text": "The Seattle Mariners are looking to get back to the postseason next year.\nIn 2022, they were a postseason team and even won a series.\nBut, they fell short of the playoffs in 2023.\nThe AL West is one of the toughest divisions in baseball.\nThe Mariners have to compete with both the Texas Rangers and Houston Astros for a playoff berth.\nFor Seattle, they knew they needed to make additions to their roster.\nOne player they went out and signed away from their rival is catcher Mitch Garver.\nAccording to the Mariners, they signed Garver to a two-year contract.\nAdding some Garv-sauce to the squad ðŸ‘Š\nWe have signed C/DH Mitch Garver to a 2-year contract through 2025 with a mutual option that runs through the 2026 season.\nðŸ”—\n [pic.twitter.com/bAj9GW3hTc]\nâ€” Seattle Mariners (@Mariners)\n[December 28, 2023]\nGarver is coming off one of the best offensive seasons of his career.\nHe batted .270 with 19 home runs, 50 RBI, and an OPS of .870.\nGarver now joins a loaded catcherâ€™s room in Seattle.\nCal Raleigh and Garver will be a great one-two punch for the Mariners.\nIt is rare to get quality offensive production from a catcher.\nWell, the Mariners should be able to get that from both of theirs.\nSeattle has plenty of work to do to compete in the AL West next year.\nOne spot they can use some help is in the outfield.\nThey traded away Jarred Kelenic and Teoscar Hernandez is a free agent.\nOutside of Julio Rodriguez, the Mariners do not have any proven outfielders.\nIt will be interesting to see what other moves the Mariners make.\nIf they are serious about contending their front office should be aggressive in free agency.\nNEXT: Mariners Reportedly Interested In Top Power Bat",
