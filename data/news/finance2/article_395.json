    "text": "SEATTLE —\nLTD EDITION SUSHI\nWe start our food accolades tour on Seattle’s Capitol Hill at a restaurant the\nNew York Times named one of the top 50 in the country: Ltd Edition Sushi. They heard about the good news before they even got out of bed.\n\"She texted me at six in the morning,\" said Chef and Co-owner Keiji Tsukasaki. \"She's like, 'Hey, I saw your newspaper, The New York Times.' And I was like, 'That's good, good surprise.' I didn't expect something like that.\"\nThe Times said: \"The traditional preparations are superb.\" The small-space restaurant specializes in a pre-set, omakase-style menu which translates to, you're leaving the sushi choices up to the chef.\n\"Every day, we just do the two rounds. 16 people each, about 30 people every day. Just one menu. Me and Jun, our goal is to serve good fish,” Tsukasaki said.\nLtd Edition Sushi\n1641 Nagle Pl Suite 006, Seattle, WA 98122\nSEABIRD\nAnother restaurant receiving national praise is\nSeabird on Bainbridge Island. Recently Bon Appetit magazine put the place in their 24 best new restaurants of 2023 list.\n\"They started snooping around. In the springtime, after they interviewed everyone on the staff, I wasn't sure what it was going to manifest as. I thought maybe it'd be doing a piece on Bainbridge and have like a little snippet of balance. But no, it was a huge honor,” said Chef Brendan McGill.\nBon Appetit wrote: \"Chef-owner Brendan McGill's meticulously sourced menu is a heartfelt tribute to the Pacific Northwest.\"\n\"We're focused on seafood and vegetables, the most simply put. But we try to get seafood from the waters close to us. Vegetables from our farm and Bainbridge Island and Kitsap and Olympic peninsula,” said McGill. \"I think it feels quintessentially Pacific Northwest here, which is awesome. That's what we're going for.\"\nSeabird\n133 Winslow Way E, Bainbridge Island, WA 98110\n206-201-3789\nCANLIS\nFinally, awards are nothing new for Seattle fine-dining icon\nCanlis. But when Aisha Ibrahim found out she was named one of Food & Wine magazines' best new chefs, the former basketball player turned cook was caught off guard.\n\"The editor of Food & Wine reached out and like, 'Hey, I would love to do this story on you,'” said Chef Ibrahim. \"And Krusjhman's like, 'Surprise! By the way, this is not a story on Ramadan. Congratulations, you are a best new chef for Food and Wine Magazine.'\"\nFood & Wine wrote: \"She is cultivating a thoroughly modern tasting menu and a positive kitchen culture.\"\n\"We invest a lot of our energy into people.\" said Ibrahim. \"And it's nice to see that come back to see people like bring it and meet you in the middle, it's a gift. My team is a huge gift to me. You have to love your craft, you have to love the intentionality of everything. You have to love hospitality and have to care for guests and care for your team. And this is just kind of like icing on the cake.\"\nCANLIS\n2576 Aurora Ave N, Seattle, WA 98109\n206-283-3313\n[KING 5's Evening](/evening) celebrates the Northwest. Contact us:",
