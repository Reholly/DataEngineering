    "text": "Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) extended its recovery for the second straight session on Thursday after shedding 7,923 points in previous sessions, with the benchmark KSE-100 Index gaining 1,188.61 points (+1.95 percent) to close at 62,052.23 points. The market opened on a positive note and remained in the green territory throughout the session, albeit, some profit-taking was witnessed in the last 90 minutes trading. The bulls regained their dominance two days after an all-out rout when the benchmark of representative shares recorded its biggest day-on-day decline. On Wednesday, the stocks regained some of the lost ground amid value-hunting by investors. According to experts, value hunters were in action leading to across the board buying. Moreover, fresh liquidity is being injected as the market enters a new month, they said. They attributed the bullish momentum to “adequate amount of futures positions being rolled over.” They said that the market bounced back sharply during the last two sessions after a correction. They noted that market participants are expecting interest rates to decline in 2024, coupled with a broad-based re-rating of the market. “More than 125 stocks are trading 70pc below the May 2017 market cap in dollar terms. There is a significant valuation gap between Pakistan and other markets and that should keep foreign investors active,” they added. The benchmark index traded in a range of 1,658.5 points, showing an intraday high of 62,750.77 points and an intraday low of 61,092.27 points.
