    "text": "In this incredibly varied role, you'll help manage a store that's better and more successful than ever before.\nYou'll take real pride in maximising sales, ensuring great customer service, minimising costs and optimising operational efficiency. There's real responsibility too. In the absence of the Store Manager and Assistant Store Manager, you'll be fully in charge of the store, gaining valuable experience to help you take your next step in management. It means you'll tackle everything from ordering stock to training employees, and from checking product displays to delivering sales targets. It feels great to be part of a business that does things its own way and achieves fantastic results while doing so.\nReference: 51816202\nPlease note\nReed.co.uk does not communicate with candidates via Whatsapp, and we will never ask you to provide your bank, passport or driving licence details during the application process.
