    "text": "I've been going on cruises for over 10 years, so I have some tips for first-time cruisers . Book directly through a cruise line and reconsider drink packages to save money. I've been on dozens of cruises in the past 10 years, and I've learned a lot about the best ways to sail .\nHere are my best tips for someone booking their first cruise .\nTake the time to choose the right cruise line and ship for you Not all cruise lines are the same. Some, like Disney Cruise Line , showcase beloved characters and have mostly family-friendly activities.\nOthers, like Norwegian Cruise Line , target cruisers looking for a more upscale and modern cruise ship with plenty to do for adults and older teens.\nTo find the right cruise line, consider what you want to do on the ship and the types of travelers you want to sail with.\nThen, narrow down to the right ship by looking at what each offers. Also, consider your budget and what type of stateroom you'll want to book .\nBook your cruise by calling the cruise line directly to get the best deal In my experience, the best way to get deals is to call the cruise line directly to book your sailing.\nAlthough you may have seen some deals on the cruise line's website, people working in the booking center can see every deal you're eligible for at once.\nBecause of that, they can see which offer will save you the most money.\nFor example, on a recent sailing with Carnival, I saw discounts on standard balcony rooms online. When I called, an employee told me I was also eligible for a discount through the casino because of my spending on a previous sailing.\nI'd had no idea, and the latter was the better deal for me and my family.\nJoin a Facebook group for your cruise After you book your cruise, try to find the appropriate Facebook group for your sailing.\nYou can do that by using the search bar and typing in the ship's name and the dates of your sailing, like \\\"Norwegian Prima, December 2-5, 2022.\\\"\nIf you can't find one, consider starting one yourself.\nThe groups are a fun way to meet other people who are going to be on your sailing. They're also a great place to ask questions about the trip.\nI've learned a lot from lurking in these groups.\nTry to explore the ship online before you leave your house All major cruise lines have ship models online that guests can virtually explore before getting to the terminal.\nThis is a great tool to use to learn where your stateroom is, what's around it, and which activities are on the ship.\nUsually, you can explore the ship floor-by-floor, and if you click on a restaurant, lounge, or something else, a small description of the space will pop up so you can learn more about it.\nBook the port excursions you want to do ahead of time Booking a port excursion before getting on the ship is the best way to secure your spot on tours and fun activities.\nMany people will book excursions on the ship, and the lines at the port desk can get very long, especially as more people arrive.\nYou may also want to consider booking excursions with reliable third-party vendors that have good reviews online and don't take you too far from the pier.\nAll-inclusive beach days are a great option to book with third-party groups because most beaches are just a short walk or taxi ride away from the ship.\nThe downside to booking excursions that are not through the cruise line is that if you are late getting back, the ship will not wait for you, and you could be left in an unfamiliar port city.\nThe best bet to not get left behind is to leave the excursion or beach at least an hour and a half before the ship's departure time.\nTry to get to the departure city at least a day early One of the biggest stress-relieving tips for cruising is getting to your cruise's departure city at least a day early.\nThis will help you board the ship on time and relieve some travel stress regarding delayed flights on the day your ship sets sail.\nArriving a day early will add to your overall vacation cost, so be sure to budget for an extra night at a hotel and food for the extra day.\nAlways pack a carry-on bag for the first day of the cruise When boarding a cruise ship, you don't carry your larger suitcases with you.\nOn embarkation day, staterooms typically aren't ready until later in the afternoon, and luggage can arrive well after dinner.\nBecause of this, I recommend bringing a carry-on bag for the first day of your cruise.\nI usually suggest bringing a swimsuit so you can enjoy the pool, plus any charging cords, medications, and sunscreen you may need.\nReally, really consider if drink packages are worth it Most cruise lines offer drink packages that can draw you in with the idea that you pay a flat fee once and get over a dozen alcoholic beverages in one day.\nBut I suggest crunching some numbers to decide if the packages will be worth it for you. For many packages, you need to drink seven or eight cocktails a day to break even.\nOn most cruise lines, everyone in your stateroom has to order the drink package to deter people from sharing drinks with others.\nDrink packages are priced per day and must be bought for the entirety of a cruise. So, on a seven-night cruise, you must buy a seven-night drink package.\nBut you can also check if the drink package includes specialty coffee or milkshakes, which can help offset the cost.",
