    "text": "Thierry Henry has hailed Arsenal transfer target Dominic Solanke amid his glowing form for AFC Bournemouth this season in the Premier League.\nArsenal news, exclusives and analysis\nPrivacy Policy https://policies.google.com/privacyand Terms of Serviceapply.\nMikel Arteta\nwill reportedly push for Arsenal to sign Solanke in the January transfer window if they miss out on Ivan Toney.\nThe 26-year-old former Chelsea and Liverpool star has registered 12 goals across 18 top-flight matches this term – with only Erling Haaland having scored more.\nWith\nArsenal set to miss out on a deal for Brentford’s Toney, they could now look to snatch Solanke from the Cherries if they are willing to do business.\nFollowing Arsenal’s 2-0 defeat to West Ham on Thursday night,\nin which Henry called out struggling forward Gabriel Jesus, the Arsenal legend spoke in glowing terms about Solanke, who has been capped once by England.\nAsked to name a player who has impressed him in the Premier League this season, Henry told Amazon Prime: ‘Dominic Solanke, the way he is playing at Bournemouth.\n‘Not only him, the team is doing extremely well, but we have been waiting for him to be that player.\n‘It guess it was a bit too much when he was younger. But what he is doing right now is brilliant.\nI am happy for him because he did struggle for a little bit. Now he is looking good.’\nSolanke only signed a new deal with Bournemouth in September, committing himself to the south coast club until 2027.\nMORE :\nAlan Shearer blames two Arsenal stars over contentious West Ham goal\nMORE :\nWhy VAR allowed Tomas Soucek's controversial goal in Arsenal v West Ham to stand",
