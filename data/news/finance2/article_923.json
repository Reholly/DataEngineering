    "text": "The tour flyer was inspired by Squid Games The Challenge's website for finding contestants that aired in the popular Netflix show and it features original promotional material used for Sip The Kid's debut on Netflix and Bigga$tate's Cartoon avatar adds a fun spin alongside all the sponsors and affiliates that helped make the tour possible, including Afroman will be performing alongside Bigga$tate and Sip The Kid will host all the events to remind everyone of Netflix as promotion. The partnership between Netflix, Squid Games, Deandre Smith also known as Sip The Kid and Jonathan Henderson also known as Bigga$tate comes as no surprise as both Creators of the Tour, have already been seen on Netflix for 2 Movies and Shows, especially Sip The Kid who has just recently aired in the \"Squid Games The Challenge\" that just had their season Finale Dec 7th. Bigga$tate will be the first musician in history to Curate and pitch a tour successfully to Netflix. From Squid Games The Experience to Podcasts and even Livestreaming to express how they feel after being on \"Squid Games The Challenge.\" All participants on the popular Netflix show was given free reign to promote alongside Netflix any way they could come up with. But no one would have ever guessed that from a one time brainstorm between Sip The Kid and Bigga$tate, would come an idea that helped them both make history by creating a music tour around the most popular show on Netflix that has never added any music tours themed around Squid Games before.\nWith this being the first one ever, it has inspired St. Louis Cardinals to sponsor content and even attracted Afroman to perform alongside Bigga$tate who will add many events from his hometown in Chicago to bring back commercial opportunities to a city that brought even more opportunities to him. And ironically Sip The Kid's first movie role was in Chicago so they decided to add many dates from that city and Iowa, considering Sip The Kid's Hometown as well. There was no better addition for the Iowa roster part of the Tour than Tone Da Boss who has brought many events and joy to Iowa as a music label owner who is loved by his city enough to have a holiday given to him by the mayor.\nThe Creators of the tour decided to affiliate their Squid Games #181 Tour with this Win Tour. Bigga$tate will be performing his song with popular rapper Bobby Shmurda and Darrion Da Don another Chicago artist recruited by Bigga$tate for the tour from personally knowing how hard it is to change the narrative of being labeled a dangerous rapper just by where you're from or who you know, like he is often associated with Fbg Duck due to his relative but Darrion Da Don aims to leave a legacy for his daughter instead, by doing things like this with Netflix that helps the world see him for his craft and not just for the politics of his city. The Tour starts December 29th 2023.\n Squid Games #181 Music Tour\nContact Person: Jonathan Henderson\nEmail: Send Email\nCountry: United States\nWebsite: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C1VIdIFOwW4/?igsh=MTVvdmZvYThqbDBsdQ==",
