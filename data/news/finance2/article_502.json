    "text": "BOISE, Idaho — A new survey from the U.S. Census Bureau analyzing five-year periods shows Idaho led the nation with a 15% growth rate in median household income. The 2018-2022 American Community Survey puts Idaho's median household income at $70,214. The Gem State's median increase of $9,153 from the 2013-2017 survey ranked fifth nationally for dollar-for-dollar growth, in part due to Idaho's population growth during the COVID-19 pandemic. The [Idaho Department of Labor](https://idahoatwork.com/2023/12/22/idahos-15-median-household-income-growth-highest-in-nation/) said wages increased in sectors such as healthcare, social assistance, accommodations, food service and education, with the need for entry-level service workers outweighing the amount of \"willing employees.\" People working remotely for an employer in a higher-wage state – while living in a state with a lower-wage structure – also may have impacted Idaho's nation-leading jump in median household income, according to Labor Economist Jan Roeser. Another factor is the state's housing boom, which increased the demand for construction workers. The labor department said growth lands in the middle- and high-income categories in most Idaho counties as the state's economy expands. As shown in the graphic below, notable increases in median household income were evident in other western states. A decline in median household wages occurred in other regional states with \"less economic diversity and a robust energy sector,\" the Idaho Department of Labor reported. Median Household Income Growth (from 2013-2017 survey to 2018-2022 survey): Roeser said lower-paid households in Idaho may be transitioning to the next income category, as shown in the graphic below detailing household income movement in the Gem State. Estimates show an increase in household income for those earning $35,000 or more, but a decrease for less than $35,000. “High housing costs may be a motivator for low wage earners to leave the state for more affordable housing,” Roeser said. “People in the higher income brackets are becoming a larger share of Idaho’s total households with some in-migrating from other states.” Idaho Household Income Movement: According to the [Idaho Department of Labor](https://idahoatwork.com/2023/12/22/idahos-15-median-household-income-growth-highest-in-nation/), the state ranked fourth nationally in housing unit growth, with an increase of nearly 57,000 units from the 2013-2017 survey to the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2018-2022 American Community Survey. 62% of the change occurred in the Boise Metropolitan Statistical Area, while other notable increases occurred in Bonneville County (9.4% or 1,316 units), Kootenai County (11.4% or 7,745 units) and Twin Falls County (7.9% or 2,549 units). Elmore County (-2.2% or – 275 units), Fremont County (-2.8% or -249 units) and Lemhi County (-4.5% or -219 units), were the three counties with the most-significant decline in housing units. The labor department said a total of 17 Idaho counties saw a decline in housing units.
