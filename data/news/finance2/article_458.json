    "text": "CINCINNATI (WKRC) - It was a successful holiday season for many retailers both local and national. According to NPR, retail spending rose just over 3% compared to 2022. This marks a return to pre-pandemic spending trends despite credit card debt being on the rise and federal student loan payments resuming. Local boutiques said sales were up this holiday season, including JC Boutique in Western Hills, and Shop Charbon in Delhi. They said this is all thanks to the community's support, and of course, the awesome local team merch. \"When you shop local, the money stays here. My kids go to the Oak Hills School District, we support the team, we're not big business. When you buy here, you're not helping pay for big offices or big budgets. When you spend money in small businesses it stays in the community,\" said Owner of JC Boutique, Jessica Castellini. Shop Charbon in Delhi also saw a similar, successful trend going into this holiday season. The owner said they appreciate the community's support, especially around the holidays. \"I think overall, sales were good, especially in the economic climate right now. Because we know that you can spend your money everywhere, so we try to make it an experience, and have that 110% customer service,\" said Owner of Shop Charbon, Shannon Visconti. Both boutiques opened up during the pandemic and had to overcome many obstacles to stay in business. \"We opened up in January 2020, then the pandemic hit in March and immediately shut us down. It was nerve wracking, we put all of our eggs in one basket and then the pandemic hit,\" said Castellini. But now, both businesses are on the right track, they continue to keep growing and driving in more business. Both said social media has helped attract shoppers to their stores. And both encourage the community to keep supporting small businesses. \"You have to shop local, keep your money in the states, it will be in your neighborhood and in the local economy, it's so important,\" said Visconti.",
