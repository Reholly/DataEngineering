    "text": "Amid the bustling corridors of the FITUR event in Madrid, a pivotal dialogue unfolded, casting a spotlight on the intersection of sustainability and profitability within the hospitality sector. The roundtable, hosted by BEONx and Hotelverse and moderated by LADEVI journalist Borja Cameselle, convened industry pioneers Finn Ackermann from Iberostar, Patrick Apostolo from Radisson Hotels, and Helen Montijano from Bahia Principe. Together, they delved into how sustainability practices not only safeguard our planet but also bolster the bottom line.\nCharting the Course towards Net Positive Hospitality\nThe Sustainable Hospitality Alliance, in collaboration with entities such as GRESB, Hotelschool The Hague, and Club Med, is at the vanguard of steering the hospitality industry towards Net Positive Hospitality. This ambitious initiative seeks to transcend mere sustainability, aiming for a hospitality sector that contributes more to the environment and society than it extracts. The Alliance's CEO underscored the significant strides made in 2023, highlighting the launch of a digital version of the Pathway to Net Positive Hospitality, a tool designed to guide hotels and resorts in this transformative journey.\nONYX Hospitality Group's Pioneering Moves\nONYX Hospitality Group, headquartered in Bangkok, epitomizes the industry's shift towards sustainability. Through its partnership with UNESCO for Cultural Sustainability and its commitment to achieving Carbon Neutrality, ONYX is redefining responsible tourism. The group's collaboration with WWF Thailand on sustainable consumption and production projects further showcases its dedication to preserving cultural heritage and promoting community-based tourism across Asia and the Pacific. These initiatives underscore ONYX's resolve to not only minimize its environmental footprint but also to foster a positive social impact within the communities it operates.\nAdvancing Social Sustainability in Hospitality\nAt the heart of the sustainability discourse is the imperative to measure and report on social sustainability. The Sustainable Hospitality Alliance emphasizes the adoption of internationally recognized standards and frameworks for this purpose. Despite the challenges in assessing social sustainability, the Alliance advocates for a strategic approach that includes engaging with local communities, investing in employee development, and promoting inclusivity and equity. This focus on creating a positive social impact aligns with the Net Positive Hospitality philosophy, reinforcing the sector's role in driving societal progress.\nIn recognition of its unwavering commitment to environmental and social responsibility, Minor International has emerged as the leading hotel operator in S&P Global's Sustainability Yearbook 2024. This accolade, marking the company's fourth consecutive feature in the Yearbook, highlights Minor Hotels' dedication to business ethics, human capital development, climate strategy, and talent attraction. With a pledge to become a net-zero organization by 2050, Minor Hotels exemplifies the industry's collective endeavor towards sustainable and socially responsible operations.\nThe FITUR event roundtable illuminated the economic and social dividends of sustainable practices in the hospitality industry. By integrating sustainability with cultural elements, focusing on staff wellbeing, and leveraging education, hotels and resorts can realize returns within two to three years. The panelists underscored the critical role of collaboration, transparency, and technology in enhancing operational efficiency and driving the industry towards a more sustainable and profitable future. As the hospitality sector continues to navigate its sustainability journey, the insights shared at the FITUR event serve as a beacon, guiding the way towards a more responsible and resilient industry.",
