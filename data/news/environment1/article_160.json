    "text": "The benefits of transitioning to electric school buses are many\nTo the Editor:\nNew York will transition to electric school buses by 2035. This will provide long-term benefits of reducing maintenance cost for our school districts, improving the health and safety of our children, and benefiting the overall environment.\nThe state provided $100 million to support school districts with this goal. Despite this, budget anxiety by school boards persists.\nI contacted State Sen. Pamela Helming and Assemblyman Brian Manktelow and asked what measures they were taking to support schools. Their responses were dismaying.\nMs. Helming acknowledged the problem, but instead of taking positive action, her response was to “oppose state mandates.” Translation: She is not going to help. She is going to obstruct and criticize.\nMr. Manktelow refused to directly respond to me in writing. I took this refusal to go on the record as evidence that he is not going to help, either.\nRather than work cooperatively with colleagues to improve lives of New Yorkers, they exacerbate the situation so they can stand on their soapbox and proclaim themselves the medicine to what ails us.\nWe must expect more of our representatives than this do-nothing and obstruct approach.\nI have had the pleasure of meeting candidates running for the state and federal legislatures. I can tell you there are good people out there that want to build stronger communities and take our state forward. It is our responsibility to seek these people out and to support them and give them our vote.\nJOHN SPIEGEL\nPalmyra",
