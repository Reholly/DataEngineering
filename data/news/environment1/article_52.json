    "text": "News\nFarmers glad to see dicamba back in toolbox for 2024\nA director with the American Soybean Association says he’s pleased the Environmental Protection Agency is allowing farmers to use existing stocks of dicamba for the upcoming growing season.\nThis week, EPA issued an existing stocks order for dicamba, allowing for its limited use in 2024. The order applies to dicamba that was “packaged, labeled, and released for shipment” prior to a February 6 ruling that vacated dicamba registration.\nAlan Meadows, a western Tennessee farmer, tells Brownfield he uses the herbicide to control weeds in his soybeans and there was uncertainty about the product following a recent court ruling.\n“It left a lot of questions here on our farm about exactly how we’d move forward, what the next steps would be.”\nMeadows says there’s more clarity now and he’s not concerned about getting the dicamba supplies he needs.\n“There should be plenty of existing stocks as of today, based on how I understand it. That’s always subject to change, but right now, that’s how I understand it.”\nMeadows says he’s looking for more certainty on the future of dicamba use beyond the upcoming growing season so he can make the best product decisions for 2025.\nMeadows is an at-large member of the 2024 ASA Executive Committee.",
