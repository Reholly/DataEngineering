    "title": "80% in just 21 minutes: Hyundai expands ultra-fast EV charging network in India",
    "text": "[Hyundai](/topic/hyundai)Motor India is taking a significant leap towards making electric vehicles more accessible across the country. The company has recently expanded its ultra-fast [EV charging network](/topic/ev-charging-network)by setting up 11 new charging stations in various cities and along major highways. These new charging stations are strategically placed to benefit cities like Mumbai, Pune, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Gurugram, and Bangalore. They are also located along highways such as Delhi-Chandigarh, Delhi-Jaipur, Hyderabad-Vijayawada, Mumbai-Surat, and Mumbai-Nashik.\nThe aim of these charging stations is to provide quick and convenient charging options for electric vehicle owners. Most of them operate 24/7, catering to both city dwellers and long-distance travelers. The charging stations utilize advanced technology that enables vehicles to be charged rapidly and efficiently. For example, the Hyundai IONIQ 5, one of Hyundai's electric vehicle models, can be charged from 10% to 80% in just 21 minutes using these chargers.\nTo make the charging process even more convenient, customers can use the MyHyundai app. The app allows users to discover charging stations, navigate to them, pre-book charging slots, make digital payments, and monitor the charging status. Looking ahead, Hyundai plans to further expand its ultra-fast charging network to 10 or more new locations by 2024. Additionally, as part of an agreement with the Government of Tamil Nadu, Hyundai aims to install 100 charging stations by 2027.\n(You can now subscribe to our\nEconomic Times WhatsApp channel) [Business News](/news), [Breaking News](/breakingnewslist.cms) [Budget 2024 News](/budget), [Budget 2024 Live Coverage](/news/newsblogs/budget-live-news-updates-india-budget-2024-nirmala-sitharaman-live-speech-announcements-interim-budget-impacts-railways-education-auto-healthcare-latest-news-1-feb-2024/liveblog/107302765.cms), Events and [Latest News](/news/latest-news)Updates on [The Economic Times](/).)\nDownload\nThe Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.
