    "text": "[+](javascipt:void(0);)\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi is set to virtually lay the foundation stone for a 300 MW solar power plant in Rajasthan today, according to an official statement from the Ministry of Coal. The project, funded with an investment exceeding Rs 1,756 crore, aims to provide affordable power to government entities. NLC India Limited, a leading Navratna CPSE under the Ministry of Coal, is spearheading the initiative in Barsingsar, Bikaner district, as part of the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy’s CPSE Scheme.\nThe solar project incorporates advanced technology, including high-efficiency bifacial modules made in India, aligning with Prime Minister Modi’s Atma Nirbhar Bharat initiative. The generated electricity will be transmitted through existing power lines of Barsingsar Thermal Power Station, with an annual target of producing approximately 750 million units of green power. This is expected to offset carbon dioxide emissions by around 18,000 million metric tonnes over its lifetime.\nThe power usage agreement for the project has been finalized with Rajasthan Urja Vikas Nigam Limited at a competitive tariff of Rs 2.52 per unit for the next 25 years. The project is scheduled for commissioning by September 2024, with potential employment opportunities for about 600 individuals during the project phase and 100 personnel during the operations and maintenance phase.\nThe official statement emphasizes that the project will assist Rajasthan in meeting its renewable purchase obligation while contributing to the nation’s journey towards achieving a net-zero future. NLCIL, operating the 250 MW Barsingsar Thermal Power Station (BTPS), has obtained a 300 MW solar project capacity through competitive bidding in the CPSE Scheme Phase-II Tranche-III facilitated by the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA).",
