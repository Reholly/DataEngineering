    "text": "AsiaOne has launched EarthOne , a new section dedicated to environmental issues — because we love the planet and we believe science. Find articles like this there .\nPHNOM PENH — In a small warehouse in Cambodia's capital, a group of workers sits and spins waste plastic bottles into strips, turning them into bristles for brooms, of which they churn out 500 each day.\nFor the past 11 months, they have transformed around 40 tonnes of discarded plastic bottles, or about 5,000 bottles a day, by \"upcycling\" them into brooms they say are more robust than regular brushes.\nThose sell for 10,000 riel (S$3.30) and 15,000 riel each.\nPlastic strips from the empty bottles are collected into a bundle on a machine, before being softened in hot water and sliced evenly to be sewn with metal wires into the ends of a bamboo stick.\nCambodian entrepreneur Has Kea, 41, wants to reduce plastic pollution in his community, in a city that produces up to 38,000 tonnes of all types of waste each day, according to its environmental department.\nAbout one-fifth of that is single-use plastic that ends up in landfills and waterways.\n\"This broom is quite solid, not easy to break,\" said Suon Kosal, a 26-year-old Buddhist monk whose temple bought 80 of the brooms in January.\nKea buys empty plastic bottles from trash collectors and garbage depots. With the seemingly endless supply, he is confident about the longevity of his business.\nHe is also open to competitors stepping in to the market.\n\"This also helps reduce pollution to the environment and encourages people to collect plastic bottles to sell to us at a higher price, which in turn could earn them a better living,\" he said.\n[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc-rt80hROQ[/embed]\nALSO READ: Indonesian transgender models shine spotlight on pollution with plastic fashion",
