    "text": "Environment\nTobago oil spill under control, says Emergency Management Agency\nSan Juan, Feb 15 (EFE).- The director of the Tobago Emergency Management Agency, Allan Stewart, said that his agency is “in command and control” of the oil spill caused a week ago by an overturned vessel off the southwest coast of Tobago.\nAccording to Trinidad and Tobago’s Ministry of National Security, at least two vessels, a Panamanian tug and a Guyana-bound barge, were involved in the spill.\n“We have this under control and we will come out shining where this matter is concerned,” Stewart told a news conference at the Scarborough wharf on Wednesday.\nAuthorities have fenced off the area heavily affected by the spill, which was caused by an abandoned ship more than a week ago, but was not disclosed until Sunday.\nAlthough the crude oil has blackened part of the west coast, Tobago’s most popular beaches have not been affected, said Tobago House of Assembly chief clerk Farley Augustine.\n“It is only a radius of 15 kilometers but the vast majority of our beaches, especially the ones you love, the vast majority of our reef systems, they all remain in pristine condition and Tobago is here welcoming you,” he said.\nAugustine said some of the oil from the affected areas had traveled more than 88 kilometers outside Tobago’s waters.\nA team of oil spill response experts arrived on the island on Monday to conduct quality control and analyze the impact on species.\n“We have a team that is working 24/7 looking at wildlife species and the impact on wildlife species and they essentially are extracting species that might be at risk, that might have come into contact with the hydrocarbons” the chief clerk added.\nSeveral areas in Lambeau and Canoe Bay have been cordoned off for the safety of the public and fishermen have been advised not to fish there.\nPrime Minister Keith Rowley called the spill a “national emergency” on Sunday.
