    "text": "New Jersey has set a significant precedent by becoming the first state to require the recycling of electric vehicle (EV) batteries. This new legislation, which will come into effect in January 2027, places the responsibility for EV battery recycling primarily on the manufacturers of these batteries.\nWhy It Matters: New Jersey passed the Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Management Act on January 8. The Act makes it illegal to dispose of EV batteries in landfills and instead mandates their reuse and recycling. The Act also requires EV battery producers to register with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) starting January 2025 and to report the quantity of EV batteries they sell in the state by January 2026.\nThe DEP will then provide the industry with a framework of standards and criteria for the entire recycling process. Once this framework is finalized, each battery producer must develop a written management plan that includes take-back programs for used EV batteries sold within the state. These programs may include a complete vehicle take-back program, a battery take-back program, or any other DEP-approved program.",
