    "text": "(WBBM NEWSRADIO) – Bald eagle sightings are being touted in places you might not have thought of in the Chicago area. The Chicago Park District says the raptors have been regularly seen at Big Marsh Park on the Southeast Side as well as along the North Branch of the Chicago River at Horner Park. “The bald eagles are so big, and they’re so close to the ground often times that you don’t need binoculars,” says Stephen Bell, director of the Ford Calumet Environmental Center at Big Marsh Park. Big Marsh Park connects to Lake Calumet, which joins the Calumet River, which links to Lake Michigan. “All of that open space and water provides ideal habitats for large birds, like bald eagles,” Bell said. There have been six bald eagles spotted at Big Marsh Park this year, but that as many as 12 have been spotted in previous years, he said. “Right now, they’re very visible because they’re going through their courtship process, which is where the eagles will do specific calls and acrobatics.” The Park District along with the Chicago Bird Alliance and the Chicago Ornithological Society have begun a Bird Photo Contest. Between now and Aug. 1, people can submit pictures of any of the 350 species of birds they spot in the city. Winners will receive $100 cash and have their pictures professionally displayed at Big Marsh Park. Also on the Chicago bird front, the Chicago Park District board has renamed the Montrose Dune Expansion Area after the Piping Plovers that made the area a regular nesting spot. It’s now known as the Monty and Rose Wildlife Habitat.
