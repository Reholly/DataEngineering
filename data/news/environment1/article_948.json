    "text": "This Thursday, February 15, on the Trocadéro esplanade,\nNagui\n and\nHugo Clément\nparticipated in an act of activism alongside volunteers from the L214 association.\nTheir goal ?\nDenounce the intensive breeding practices of chickens in France, including “genetic selection” to which many industrialists are said to have resorted.\nTo discover\nTV program this evening: our selection of the day\nForty-four dead chickens were presented on the square, in order to best show the stages of this abusive breeding.\n“They will grow in an extremely abnormal way, they will gain weight to the point of reaching 60 times their weight in six weeks,”\nassures Nagui on BFMTV.\nThey can no longer walk, they fit on an A4 sheet, which is the space they have left to move,”\ncontinues the presenter of “Don’t forget the words”.\nRead alsoAssociation L214: chicken corpses exhibited in Paris to denounce intensive farming\nAt the heart of the indignation is the ECC charter, or the European Chicken Commitment.\nThis charter followed the alert launched by around thirty European NGOs, including L214 in 2017. The goal was to achieve a new standard for broiler production, but the latter is apparently not respected.\nNagui, a vegetarian for years, and Hugo Clément, very involved in the animal cause, obviously sounded the alarm.\nNo boycott\nHowever, the presenters and the association also emphasize that they support breeders, LDC and consumers in a desire to respect the ECC charter.\n“There is no call for a boycott\n,” assures Nagui, still at the microphone of BFMTV.\n“\nThe idea of ​​L214 is to say, to breeders as well as to consumers and to LDC, “let’s do things normally””\n.\nFor his part, Hugo Clément spoke on X, where he is outraged about intensive breeding which he describes as “cruel”.\nContacted by AFP\n,\nthe agri-food giant LDC denounces “\ndisinformation about French breeding\n”, as well as a movement of “\ndenigration\n” towards the group itself.\nThose concerned are indignant:\n“This is an affront to the professionalism of all our farmers, of all employees in our sector,”\ndenounces the person.\nAll the specifications and all the regulations are there,”\nshe assures our colleagues at\nAFP.",
