    "text": "Both Gresham Fire & Emergency Services buildings that got the radon red flag have been deemed, and tested, safe thanks to mitigation systems put in place by the city of Gresham. Station 75 and the Gresham Fire Training Center are back open after the placement of radon systems and rigorous secondary testing. Through those processes, all level readings were found well within safety guidelines. “We want to take care of our firefighters, their health and wellbeing is important to us,” said Gresham Fire Chief Scott Lewis. The new plan moving forward is to test all fire buildings for radon every two years. Station 75 and the training facility also now have radon monitors that report real-time numbers. It was a quick turnaround in both cases. Station 75, in Troutdale, was found to have dangerous numbers Thursday, Jan. 25 — it is unknown how long the radon levels were increased. The firefighters stationed there were moved to nearby Station 74. By Friday mitigation was installed, and by that Monday the tests were found to be clear. That timeframe held true at the training facility, which was part of a sweeping test of all fire stations. The city is now testing for radon at other buildings, including operations and city hall. “Years ago we had a radon expert that worked with the city and the common knowledge then was any building with a basement is more susceptible,” said Assistant City Manager Steve Fancher. “But Station 75 is on a slab, and had elevated radon, so we are testing everything.” Also at the behest of firefighters, the city tested all eight buildings’ drinking water. None were found to have elevated levels of lead or copper. This is not the first time the city has tested for radon. In 2019 a contractor inspected every Gresham fire station. Station 74, which has a basement, got a mitigation system put in place. But that expert did not find concerning numbers in any other building. “You don’t know what you don’t know,” Chief Lewis said. “Not one (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) inspection has flagged radon.” Radon is a naturally occurring gas that moves through the ground and gets into buildings through cracks in the floors, walls and foundations. It often accumulates in places were the ventilation is inadequate, and long-term exposure can lead to lung disease and other health complications. The elevated radon levels had nothing to do with firefighting or the equipment within those buildings. There is some speculation it could have to do with the geography and porous sediment and rocks that may allow radon to more easily move about the ground — those two buildings that had elevated numbers were in the northern parts of the city. “Radon is a potential risk in the whole Portland metro area,” Fancher said. All of that means other residences/businesses in the area could also have high levels of radon. Because it is odorless and colorless, the only way to know is through a testing kit.

Gresham City Council voted in late January to approve the use of $1.3 million in American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) dollars to make improvements to fire stations. That work is ongoing and should be largely completed by the end of spring. “Council came up with tangible, action-oriented ideas that will first and foremost take care of our firefighters,” said Interim City Manager Erik Schmidt. There are mechanical upgrades being done like better HVAC ventilation; better seals/latches on doors to ensure the positive/negative pressure holds between the apparatus and living quarters; and an industrial hygienist who has been contracted to audit every station to flag any other potential risks.",
