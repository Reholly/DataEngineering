    "text": "- KCB will have invested about Sh60 million in five years under the initiative.\n- The bank has over 207 branches. Sidi said the bank also partners with the community.\nKCB Bank has partnered with more than 12,000 schools to plant trees through its Linda Miti Initiative.\nHead of corporate and regulatory affairs Judith Sidi said on Thursday the initiative aims to grow and nurture over 1.8 million trees over the next five years in partnership with 12,684 schools.\n“This Linda Miti initiative is one of the ways in which the bank is contributing towards reduction of carbon emissions in what we do from day to day. So for KCB in terms of the environment, we are investing Sh12 million every year,” Sidi said.\nKCB will have invested about Sh60 million in five years under the initiative.\n“And, basically, what we do is work with all our branches in the whole country so that they can partner with schools,” she said.\nThe bank has over 207 branches. Sidi said the bank also partners with the community.\nIt buys tree seedlings from women's groups and the youth.\n“What we have done is to ensure that our branch managers are able to coordinate with the local communities to be able to purchase those seedlings,\" Sidi said.\nThe partnership with public schools is to ensure the trees they plant grow to maturity.\n“It is also important to make sure that we train the students to understand the importance of environmental conservation, and once they learn it at an early age it will become part of their DNA when they grow older. So, that's why we have partnered with schools in that space, but we also work with other partners on the same,” she said.\nLast year, they planted 314,000 trees and this year they are plant 320,000.\nIn 2022, KCB planted 10,781 trees in the first two months of the Linda Miti Initiative.\nThe bank works with the Kenya Forest Service and Kenya Forestry Research Institute for procurement of seedlings.\nKCB’s Linda Miti Initiative supports the state's campaign to plant 15 billion trees in the next 10 years at a cost of Sh500 billion.\nThe move seeks to increase the country’s tree cover by 30 per cent by 2032, up from the current 12.13 per cent.\nResults generated from the recent National Forest Resources Assessment 2021 indicate that Kenya has 7,180,000.66ha of tree cover, representing 12.13 per cent of the total area.\nFrom the assessment, up to 37 counties out of the 47 (79 per cent) have a tree cover percentage greater than the constitutional target of 10 per cent tree cover.\nNyeri is the leader with a tree cover of 45.17 per cent, Lamu (44.06), and Vihiga (35.92). Counties with the lowest tree cover include Kisumu (8.85), Busia (8.39), Uasin Gishu (8.04), Taita Taveta (6.87), Isiolo (6.7), Machakos (6.03), Siaya (5.27), Wajir (4.45), Mandera (3.61) and Marsabit (2.06).\nThe report shows that wooded grasslands account for the highest land cover in Kenya, with approximately 70 per cent of the total land area.",
