    "text": "2024 is a Leap Year.... making it a great year to leap into beekeeping! Explore the fascinating world of honey bees and the steps to becoming a beekeeper at “Introduction to Beekeeping.” This series is designed for someone who is interested in starting beekeeping or who would just like to learn more about honey bees. Topics that will be covered by experienced beekeepers include life of the bee, common pests and diseases, bee equipment, how to assemble bee equipment, new package installation, how to inspect a hive, and care of the colony. This year’s six-part series will be offered in person and via zoom on Thursdays, February 15 and 22, 28, March 7, 14, 21, from 6 to 7:30 pm. In addition to the weekly sessions, participants will be encouraged to listen to pre-recorded videos and review reading material. If weather permits, an outdoor hive viewing inspection will be held on the last night. This program is sponsored by University of Illinois Extension Logan-Menard-Sangamon Unit, Sangamon County Farm Bureau, and Prairie State Beekeepers. The registration fee is $45 for participants who will pick up their class materials or $55 for participants who need the materials mailed to them.
