    "text": "The Union County Board of County Commissioners is excited to announce the annual Wildlife Photography Contest has returned to the Trailside Nature and Science Center, located at 452 New Providence Road in Mountainside. Amateur photographers ages 13 and up are invited to enter their original photographs of wild animals in their natural habitat.\n“The Wildlife Photography Contest is an exciting event that allows members of our community to showcase their photography skills by capturing the natural beauty of animals in their habitats,” said Commissioner Chairwoman Kimberly Palmieri-Mouded. “You can immortalize the furry, winged, crawling, or swimming creatures that inhabit our surroundings through your camera lenses. Have fun expanding your creativity and put your skills to the test. I look forward to seeing your amazing pictures!”\nThe Wildlife Photography Contest is now accepting submissions. The photographs will be judged by local professional photographers and will be categorized according to age group: Teens, ages 13-17, Adults, ages 18 and up, and Seniors, ages 55 and older. Each photo submitted must be an unframed and un-matted 8″ x 10″ print in either black-and-white or color. The judges will be evaluating entries based on originality, composition, technical excellence, and artistic merit.\nThe winning entries will be announced at the annual Wild Earth Fest event on Sunday, April 28th, 2024. Wild Earth Fest is an outdoor family event featuring live animals, children’s activities, nature education, food, music, and more.\nTo obtain a brochure with rules and entry form for the Wildlife Photography Contest, please call Trailside at 908-789-3670 or visit\nucnj.org/trailside and go to the events section on the website.
