    "text": "News Brief\nTrash To Treasure: Here's Why India Is Seeking Collaboration With Germany In Biofuels Sector\nNayan Dwivedi\nFeb 16, 2024, 02:30 PM | Updated 02:30 PM IST\nSave & read from anywhere!\nBookmark stories for easy access on any device or the\nSwarajya app.\nGaurav Kedia, Chairman of the Indian Biogas Association (IBA), revealed to\nMoneycontrol that India is actively seeking to accelerate collaborations with Germany to leverage advanced technologies in the biofuel sector.\nThe focus is on exploring German technologies for processing feedstock beyond sugar-based sources, such as paddy straw and municipal solid waste.\n“Raw material is always a big question mark. India is looking at proven technologies from Germany that could help process raw materials such as paddy straw, Napier grass, and municipal solid waste,” said Kedia.\nIn December 2023, the Indian government banned ethanol production from sugarcane juice to ensure adequate sugar availability for domestic consumption and price stability.\nHowever, this decision was later reversed.\nAlso Read:\nSituation \"Worse\" Than Uddhav Thackeray Faction, Says Sharad Pawar As He Seeks Urgent Hearing In Supreme Court Against EC Ruling\nKedia also highlighted India's pursuit of cost-effective solutions and technology adaptation in the biogas sector, emphasising collaboration with Germany to optimise costs and update technologies according to Indian requirements.\nHe noted that Union Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Hardeep Singh Puri, held discussions with the CEO of the German Biogas Association in November 2023 to advance bilateral talks in the biogas sector.\nIndia's focus on biofuels is crucial as it aims to reduce dependence on crude oil and natural gas imports.\nTo bolster the biofuels industry, the Indian government also plans to provide financial assistance for biomass collection machinery.\nAdditionally, it mandated the blending of compressed biogas in compressed natural gas (CNG) and piped natural gas (PNG) starting from FY26, with a gradual increase in blending obligations.\nFurthermore, India launched the Global Biofuel Alliance under its G20 Presidency, aiming to facilitate biofuel adoption by offering capacity-building exercises, technical support, and policy sharing among participating countries and international organisations.\nAlso Read:\nMotorcycles Eligible For Taxi Services, States Advised To Process Permits: Centre Issues Clarification\nSave & read from anywhere!\nBookmark stories for easy access on any device or the\nSwarajya app.\nNayan Dwivedi is Staff Writer at Swarajya.\nAn appeal from Swarajya\nDear Reader,\nAt Swarajya, we rely on our readers' support through subscriptions to sustain our media platform.
