    "text": "FLINT, Mich. (WJRT) - The Michigan Infrastructure Office and the Michigan Department of Transportation announced that nearly $23 million has been awarded to multiple locations across Michigan for electric vehicle infrastructure. The goal of the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program is to increase EV accessibility for Michiganders. [Locations selected](https://www.michigan.gov/mdot/-/media/Project/Websites/MDOT/Business/Contractors/Innovative-Contracting/2023/NEVI/Round-1-Notification-of-Selection.pdf?rev=77dbb1f11ac147b3b8e5602d7b2de6c3&hash=E7ADE269C1CF92C59B92B4BFF26DAEA8) will have five years to complete their projects. Some of the projects are expected to be completed this year. The city of Flint will be getting money for two separate EV projects. Nearly $680,000 will be awarded to the Francis Energy Charging, LLC project along I-69, and more than $390,000 will be awarded to the GPM Southeast, LLC project along I-75. Alma will be receiving more than $400,000 for the GPM Southeast, LLC project along US-127. West Branch will be receiving nearly $330,000 for the Red E Charging LLC project along I-75. The money will be coming from President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Over the next five years, Michigan will receive about $110 million for electric vehicle infrastructure.
