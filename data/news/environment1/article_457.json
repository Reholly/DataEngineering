    "text": "Media Contacts - Ann Kaiser Senior Media Relations Manager The Nature Conservancy Phone: [203-243-0345](tel:203-243-0345) Email: [ann.kaiser@tnc.org](mailto:ann.kaiser@tnc.org) - Rebecca Theim Communications Manager The Pew Charitable Trusts Phone: [202-540-6828](tel:202-540-6828) Email: [rtheim@pewtrusts.org](mailto:rtheim@pewtrusts.org) The Supporting Oyster Aquaculture and Restoration Program today announced the 47 recipients of its Shellfish Growers Resiliency Fund (Fund), which is designed to develop a more resilient and sustainable U.S. shellfish industry that benefits the ocean and coastal communities. In total, $898,000 was awarded to farmer-led projects across 18 coastal states. This announcement marks a significant milestone for the [Supporting Oyster Aquaculture and Restoration (SOAR) Program], a joint initiative of The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and The Pew Charitable Trusts (Pew). “In addition to providing an important source of jobs and food, responsibly managed shellfish farms also benefit the environment by filtering water, creating wildlife habitat, and contributing to wild oyster reef restoration,” said Boze Hancock, TNC’s senior marine restoration scientist. “All these things make the shellfish sector a powerful ally in marine conservation.” The result of a robust partnership between Builders Initiative, TNC, Pew, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), state management agencies, and shellfish growers’ associations, the Fund demonstrates the opportunity for collaboration between shellfish farms and marine conservation. “Oyster farmers know what’s needed to restore and protect the waterways that are the cradle for their oysters, and the Fund recognizes and helps advance their innovative ideas,” said Laura Rodriguez, senior program officer at Builders Initiative, which has contributed financially to the Fund since 2021. “We’re proud to support these farmer-led projects and look forward to seeing how they will help build healthier ecosystems and a more resilient oyster industry in the U.S.” The shellfish industry is facing significant environmental challenges and market bottlenecks that could limit its future growth and, by extension, its capacity to support healthy coastal ecosystems. Today’s announcement builds on the first phase of the Fund, which in 2021 distributed a total of $1 million for 36 awards across 16 states, including educational initiatives to promote Indigenous-led hatcheries in Alaska, experimental development of new substrate structures that stimulate oyster growth on farms and reefs, and recycling programs that turn restaurants’ oyster shell waste into ecological barriers against flooding. Read more about some of those projects [here]. The new projects will continue to bolster ecosystem health and coastal livelihoods, with an increased focus on diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice. Southern Alabama’s Alma Bryant High School, a previous SOAR recipient, will use its second award to improve the infrastructure of its oyster academy, which supports local oyster farmers and provides hands-on career training in shellfish aquaculture for a diverse group of students. In Alaska, the fund will help Kodiak Ocean Bounty educate Native youth on algae production, an essential step towards building the state’s first rural Tribal shellfish nursery. “SOAR facilitates connections across industry, academia and coastal communities, which are fostering a more inclusive industry while also advancing marine conservation goals,” said Zack Greenberg, an officer with Pew. “A third of the projects supported by the Fund will bolster training and mentorship programs or support engagement with communities underrepresented in the aquaculture industry.” Full list of projects: Alaska - Kodiak Ocean Bounty: Rural Oyster Nursery Workforce Development - OceansAlaska: Alaskan Shellfish Hatchery Intern Program-Expanding Tribal capacity and providing opportunities for underserved communities in shellfish mariculture and hatchery/nursery practices Alabama - Alma Bryant High School: Bryant Oyster Academy - Bayou La Batre Oyster Company, LLC: Solar Powered Oyster Farm California - Hog Island Oyster Company: Fouling organism or superfood?
