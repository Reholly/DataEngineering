    "text": "Turn off the lights, give up the car, plant trees, share consumption.\nThese are some of the actions of the Decalogue of 'M'illumino di meno', the energy saving initiative of the Catrepillar broadcast of Rai Radio 2, which is held on 16 February at the same time as the National Day of Energy Saving and Sustainable Lifestyles.\n The Decalogue invites the first point to turn off and have the lights in the house, office, condominium and municipality turned off.\nAn anti-waste dinner by candlelight is the second action proposed, with empty-the-fridge recipes and low environmental impact foods.\n The third point is giving up the car for one day, with the choice of walking, cycling, using public transport or shared mobility.\n The fourth action of the Decalogue is to organize awareness-raising activities on the issues of energy efficiency and the climate crisis: talking about it with students, with colleagues, with customers.\nThe fifth point is planting trees, seedlings and flowers, excellent tools for fighting climate change.\n On the sixth, create a circular economy, putting objects that are no longer used back into circulation, for example with a 'swap party' (a party in which objects are exchanged).\n The seventh proposed action is to share an energy-intensive activity, such as traveling by car or using wi-fi, to reduce consumption and optimize resources.\nThe eighth point is to organize a non-energy-intensive event, such as an unplugged concert, a training session with reduced lights, an evening of astronomical observation.\n The ninth proposed action is to improve energy efficiency, such as defrosting the fridge or applying a jet aerator to the taps.\n Tenth and final action is to turn down the heating, wearing heavier clothes.\nReproduction reserved Â© Copyright ANSA",
