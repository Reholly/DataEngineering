He attended Vincennes University, majoring in conservation law enforcement. Upon graduation, Brand worked for the Ball State University Police Department for three years before being hired as a conservation officer.\nIn addition to his duties as a field officer, he also serves as a K-9 handler with his K-9 partner, Marley.\nDistrict 4 includes Howard, Tipton, Hamilton, Grant, Madison, Blackford, Delaware, Henry, Jay, Randolph, and Wayne counties.\nThe district award puts Brand in the running for the Pitzer Award, which is presented to the top overall conservation officer in the state and is selected from the 10 district winners.
