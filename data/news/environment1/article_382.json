    "text": "If you've ever wanted to do your bit for the environment but not sure where to start, come along to the free Nillumbik Environmental Volunteer Expo on Sunday 24 March at Edendale Community and Environment Farm. Find out all about local environmental volunteering opportunities that suit your interests, skills and availability. With lots of free, fun activities for all ages, too. There are many benefits that come from volunteering in the natural environment. You can connect with your local community, help protect and enhance biodiversity, while improving your health and sense of wellbeing. It's an opportunity to share your expertise or develop your skills and career pathways. At the Expo, you can learn about our ongoing formal volunteer roles such as Gardens for Wildlife Guides, project-based roles such as Forest Monitors, or getting involved on an occasional basis with your local Friends of Reserve group. On the day you can also: - Hear from local nature writer Harry Saddler - Discover a range of options for environmental volunteering - Meet other environmental volunteers, groups and environmental agencies - Attend a range of talks and workshops - Enjoy fun activities for all ages. Nillumbik Mayor Ben Ramcharan said he gets many emails and calls from residents asking for opportunities to do some planting, weeding or to collect some litter. \"We live in a unique and highly valued environment and we've recently heard through our consultation for the draft Biodiversity Strategy that our community loves our natural environment and wants to help protect and enhance that biodiversity,\" he said. \"I encourage you to come along to our Environmental Volunteer Expo, to learn all about the opportunities available, meet other like-minded volunteers and groups and enjoy a fun day of talks, workshops and activities for the whole family. To register to attend this free Expo go to: [nillumbik.vic.gov.au/environmental-volunteer-expo](https://www.nillumbik.vic.gov.au/Environmental-Volunteer-Expo) L to R: Nillumbik environment volunteers Bill Lord from Friends of Watery Gully in Wattle Glen, Vicky Shukuroglou from Nillumbio and Friends of Biodiversity Hohnes Hill, and Melvin Xu from North East Melbourne Intrepid Landcare.
