    "text": "staying home Neighbors in Austin campaign to save 1922 home from urbanization City staff are looking for new ways to fund restoration plans for a historic landmark that overlooks the Austin skyline. The [Norwood House](https://thenorwoodhouse.org/) sits [near I-35](https://austin.culturemap.com/news/city-life/i35-austin-construction/) and East Riverside, overlooking Downtown Austin. Wolf Sittler lives nearby and has been working to save the home since 2008. Neighbors say they hope to see the city commits to preserving history in our growing community. \"You can walk and see little remnants of bricks and patios and terracing that are all still here,\" said Kim McKnight with the Austin Parks & Recreation Department. The home, built in 1922 by Ollie and Calie Norwood, is now at a crossroads. Austin's Parks & Recreation Department has been working with the Norwood Park Foundation to preserve the house, but had to [terminate an agreement](https://www.austintexas.gov/department/norwood-house-rehabilitation) in December of 2022 \"And I would say that it was just the perfect storm of COVID and construction cost, cost escalation,\" said McKnight. In the 1980's, the home was moved to make room for condos. That project fell through, bringing the home back to its original spot, but it needs work. \"It has a brand new foundation. The subfloor is reinforced or replaced as needed. New subfloor rafters are reinforced. It has a roof that protects you from the rain,\" said Sittler. -- Read the full story and watch the video at [KVUE.com](https://www.kvue.com/article/news/local/historic-home-in-austin-has-unclear-path-forward-neighbors-rally-to-keep-restore-it/269-4061ee56-7a9e-4f41-b37b-8d2f88347121).",
