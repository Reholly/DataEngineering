    "text": "The \"Ha Long Bay, Vietnam\" of Quang Ninh is among the teams, with 400 crewmen who are scientists, businesses, investors, doctors and renowned people that love boat racing. According to the provincial Department of Tourism, the fleet will engage in several activities in Quang Ninh before leaving on March 2 for Jiuzhou port in China's Guangdong Province. The 2023-2024 race sees adventurers from all over the world to take on the challenges of racing across the oceans on 70-foot ocean racing yachts. It is divided into eight legs with 16 individual races and six ocean crossings. Quang Ninh Province will organize various activities on the occasion with a view to popularizing local attractions and luring investors, including a welcoming ceremony, a program to introduce local staples and destinations at Ha Long international port, an investment conference, static event and art performances, among others. The first Clipper Race started in October 1996, with eight teams of 60-foot yachts departing Plymouth, the U.K. More than 50 cities around the world have hosted the event so far.",
