    "text": "In a significant initiative, Power Africa, a U.S. government-led partnership, introduces the Elevate: Women’s Solar Installation Certification Course (WSICC) in Nigeria. This three-week training program aims to equip women with technical and vocational skills, enabling them to contribute to the solar energy sector. The program aligns with Power Africa’s broader goal of doubling electricity access in sub-Saharan Africa. Elevate Initiative: Power Africa Launches Solar Installation Certification Course for Women in Nigeria Power Africa’s Elevate initiative focuses on comprehensive power sector reform in Nigeria, emphasizing strengthened enabling environments and increased private sector investment. The Women’s Solar Installation Certification Course (WSICC) is a key component, providing participants with technical skills and preparing them for the Council for the Regulation of Engineering in Nigeria (COREN) Solar Photovoltaic Installation Certification examination. Empowering Nigerian Women in the Energy Sector: Power Africa’s WSICC Training Program Unveiled The WSICC is tailored to women in the energy sector seeking to transition or advance in solar energy technical fields. Additionally, women outside the energy sector with an interest in entering and assuming technical roles in the renewable energy subsector are encouraged to apply. The program targets a diverse audience, fostering inclusivity and skill development. Abuja to Host Three-Week Solar Installation Certification Course for Women in Energy Sector Applicants for the WSICC must complete a two-segment application process, including an application form and a competency assessment. The training, scheduled for March 4 to March 22, 2024, in Abuja, entails a three-week course from Monday to Friday, providing participants with hands-on technical knowledge and preparing them for industry-specific certifications. Deadline Approaching: Power Africa’s WSICC Offers Women Opportunities in Solar Energy in Nigeria Interested Nigerian women, aged 18 and above, employed or self-employed in the energy sector or aspiring to enter the sector, are encouraged to apply before the deadline on February 19, 2024. The selection process prioritizes timely and successful submission of applications, competency test scores, and a commitment to knowledge transfer within participants’ communities or workplaces. Conclusion: Power Africa’s WSICC not only addresses the gender gap in the energy sector but also aligns with broader goals of sustainable development. The initiative aims to create a skilled workforce, contributing to Power Africa’s vision of increased electricity access and capacity in sub-Saharan Africa. As the application deadline approaches, Nigerian women are encouraged to seize this opportunity for personal and professional growth in the clean energy sector.
