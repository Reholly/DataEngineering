    "text": "Studies show more women tend to be early “environmental adopters” than men, but that doesn’t appear to be the case when it comes to buying electric vehicles (EVs). Local environmental group eMERGE is looking to change that. The group is set to host ‘Women’s EV Night’ on March 7, during International Women’s Week, with local women who own an EV sharing their experiences and answering questions about owning and operating an EV. “We want to help ‘normalize; the idea of new and used EV ownership for women,” explains an eMERGE email. “By the end of this event, we want women to feel more comfortable with taking EV ownership seriously.” More than 7,000 vehicles are sold in Guelph every year, the group notes, adding, “but very few are electric.” For every EV bought instead of a gasoline or diesel-fueled vehicle reduces greenhouse gas emissions by more than three tonnes per year, making the air less polluted. Women’s EV night is set to run from 7 to 9 p.m. at the 10C shared space (42 Carden St.).
