    "text": "At the end of January, the Winnebago County Conservation Board moved its offices into the Hanson Nature Center and is now ready to showcase the new facility. The WCCB has scheduled a series of four open Houses during which people will be able to tour the new building. Those events are scheduled for 1-4 p.m. on Feb. 23, March 1, March 8, and March 16. Winnebago County Naturalist Lisa Ralls said the building still needs furnishings and exhibits, but everyone is encouraged to attend one of the open houses. In addition to touring the new facility, the will be able to enjoy some refreshments and see what the center will soon be able to offer. In the spring, once the center is furnished and has some displays, the WCCB plans to schedule a grand opening. After that, they’ll establish regular hours when the center will be open to the public. People are also reading… Ralls said the WCCB wishes to, once again, thank everyone who has contributed to the construction of the Hanson Nature Center. As a result of the move, the Winnebago County Conservation Board’s new address is the Hanson Nature Center, 41600 Highway 69, Leland, IA, 50453. The new phone number is 641-567-3390.",
