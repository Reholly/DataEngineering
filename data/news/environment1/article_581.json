    "text": "News & Views2/15/2024\nBird-X Celebrates 60 Years of Service\nBird-X, Inc., a supplier of humane bird control products since 1964, is\ncelebrating 60 years of success in the bird control industry starting this month.\nOn January 17, 1964, Bird-X began a long and rewarding journey to becoming a leading supplier of humane bird control products. Bird-X started as a small idea, inspired by a Bird Lite that was being sold to deter birds from commercial areas. Joe Seid, Sales Director at Bird-X and son of Founder, Richard Seid, tells the story of the start of Bird-X, “My father started this business with a Bird Lite, a chemical bird repellent, and an ultrasonic bird repeller—no one in the world had anything like that in 1964. They were revolutionary go-to-market products in the bird control industry.”\nIn the beginning, Bird-X was a single-employee business that was entirely operated by Richard Seid. The company spent the first 28 years selling innovative bird control products via trade publications. Readers responded to the ads in these publications and Bird-X sold bird control products directly to the end user.\n“In its early years, it was less than a Mom & Pop operation. It started with one employee—me—and I was all job descriptions, from President to shipping clerk to phone answering person. With growth, we added administrative help, then production oversight, then sales and promotion, bookkeeping, etc.” recalls Richard Seid.\nIn 1992, Joe Seid joined the family business as the company’s 10th employee and strategically expanded sales channels. This was the start of a major growth period for the company. Throughout years of a dedicated online presence combined with a knowledgeable team of bird control sales specialists, Bird-X became a time-tested leader in the bird control industry.\nNow, Bird-X proudly supplies a growing product line of over 400 humane bird control solutions used in over 60 countries around the world, with a seasoned staff —20% of which have been a part of the company for more than 25 years and have directly attributed to the tremendous growth and success.",
