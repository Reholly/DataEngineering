    "text": "Whether it’s your first time on a snowmobile or you’re ready to explore the wilderness on your own machine, there are plenty of opportunities to ride across the snow in Colorado.\n“Colorado has too many beautiful spots for snowmobiling,” said Ed Calhoun, president of the Colorado Snowmobile Association , a nonprofit that supports safety and conservation for snowmobile activity. Snowmobiling has been steadily growing in popularity in Colorado. Colorado Parks and Wildlife issues snowmobile registrations and shows that 29,505 machines were licensed in 2022, up from 24,789 in 2020.\nThe CSA is composed of 36 clubs. Its members groom about 3,000 miles of trails which also are used for Nordic skiing, dog sledding, snow biking and other winter fun. The CSA website has details on current conditions, where to take safety lessons, and the ins and outs of buying a permit.\nHere’s an introductory look at this winter activity in Colorado.\nJordan Valente of Denver enjoys a morning of fresh snow on Jan. 17, 2012, as he rides at Vail Pass Winter Recreation Area. (RJ Sangosti, The Denver Post) Snowmobile tours with something extra Why not make the most of a snowmobile day and do more than just ride? T-Lazy-Z Ranch in Aspen offers the Klondike Lunch Tour and the Majestic Lunch Tour. The Klondike tour follows a groomed trail in the White River National Forest to the Klondike cabin where a gourmet lunch awaits. (OK, the lunch features cheeseburgers, but they’re really good ones!) Kids as young as 4 can ride. Snowmobile drivers must be at least 18 years old and have a valid driver’s license.\nAlthough Independence Pass is closed to road traffic in winter, the Majestic Tour leads you to the town of Independence near the Continental Divide . The Lost Man Cabin welcomes you with a lunch and spectacular views. This ride is best for those with some experience riding. Riders must be at least 7.\nYou can combine a nice hot springs soak with your snowmobiling adventure at Mount Princeton Hot Springs near Salida. The concierge at Mount Princeton can arrange a guided snowmobile tour with a local operator. Upon your return, slide into the warm waters for a soothing soak.\nSteamboat Snowmobile Tours offers First Tracks tours on Rabbit Ears Pass, which can be a real treat on a powder day. It also offers four-hour Backcountry Adventure tours that take riders to the Continental Divide and include lunch. White Mountain Snowmobile Tours in Leadville combines snowmobiling with ziplining. The day starts with ziplining, then it’s time for lunch in town. You’ll round out the day with an afternoon of snowmobiling. Keep in mind that Leadville is 10,158 feet above sea level and you’ll be riding higher than that during this day of adventure.\nMark T. Osler, The Denver Post Mark Allen takes off on his snowmobile during a tour of Battle Mountain, south of Minturn, on Feb. 21, 2008. (Denver Post file) Rent and go Many companies rent snowmobiles, so you can explore Colorado’s winter wonderland on your own even if you don’t own a snow machine. This also means you are in charge of your own safety, so keep these safety tips in mind:\n1. Call ahead and ask what gear is included with your rental. Snowsuit or bib? Heated handlebars? Goggles? Gloves? If they’re not included, arrange to rent or buy them for your trip.\n2. Take an avalanche safety course. Carry necessary gear, including a snow shovel, and know how to complete a rescue. Avalanche risk varies from day to day. It’s up to you to research current conditions. You should set out with an alternative plan in mind in case you venture into an area where the avalanche risk appears too great.\n3. Bring water and sunscreen.\n4. Have reliable communication, which probably means something other than a cellphone.\nDon’t put yourself, your trip mates and rescue teams at risk. Most rescue teams include many volunteers. They risk their own safety when they attempt to save people who are stuck or lost.\n“Some people want to go to the expert areas right off,” Calhoun said. “Normally that’s when you get in a problem with this stuff, and avalanches are the Number One danger for snowmobiling.”\nPopular spots for snowmobilers include Leadville, Grand Lake, Vail Pass Winter Recreation Area and Rabbit Ears Pass near Steamboat Springs.\nGrand Lake is considered Colorado’s snowmobiling capital and features more than 300 miles of trails for every level of snowmobiler. There are another 700 miles of trails in surrounding Grand County. Snow machines are allowed in only a small area of Rocky Mountain National Park, but the region’s trails offer views of the park’s famous peaks and grandeur. It’s legal to ride a snowmobile in Grand Lake, provided the streets have enough packed snow.\nRelated Articles Travel | How to travel with your pet responsibly Travel | What Gen Z and millennial travelers are seeking in 2024 Travel | Accessible travel, a $58 billion market, gets its first one-stop shop Travel | Where would you live if you won the lottery? Travel | Traveling internationally? Order foreign currency before you go There are numerous outfitters to rent from in Grand Lake, and some lodges have snowmobiles available for rent.\nThe Rabbit Ears Pass area offers trails across meadows and through snow-covered trees as you ride up and over the mountainous terrain.\n“I live in Steamboat,” Calhoun said. “People come here to ski, and they ski like crazy at high altitude, and then have to rest for a day or two. During that time, they can go snowmobiling with their families.”\nAs with all winter sports, research conditions before you set out, wear appropriate gear, and always tell someone reliable where you are going and when you plan to return.\nSubscribe to our weekly newsletter, The Adventurist, to get outdoors news sent straight to your inbox.\nShare this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window) More Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Submit to Stumbleupon (Opens in new window) Most Popular Most Popular Man who shot Burnsville officers and firefighter tried to have gun rights restored after assault conviction Man who shot Burnsville officers and firefighter tried to have gun rights restored after assault conviction Children were in room with man who killed Burnsville officers and firefighter, and shot himself, mother says Children were in room with man who killed Burnsville officers and firefighter, and shot himself, mother says Twin Cities executive convicted of insider trading involving company’s acquisition by Medtronic Twin Cities executive convicted of insider trading involving company's acquisition by Medtronic ‘Heroic actions’ of law enforcement meant safety for family in Burnsville home, says relative of gunman’s girlfriend 'Heroic actions' of law enforcement meant safety for family in Burnsville home, says relative of gunman's girlfriend St. Catherine University to shutter 93-year-old early learning center in May St. Catherine University to shutter 93-year-old early learning center in May Metro Transit bus driver fatally strikes pedestrian in St. Paul’s Highland Park Metro Transit bus driver fatally strikes pedestrian in St. Paul's Highland Park Stillwater school board approves later start time for high-schoolers in 2025-26 Stillwater school board approves later start time for high-schoolers in 2025-26 The 2024 Minnesota girls state hockey tournament brackets The 2024 Minnesota girls state hockey tournament brackets Donation platform announced for families of Burnsville’s fallen first responders as second vigil is held Donation platform announced for families of Burnsville's fallen first responders as second vigil is held Magnolias Restaurant, popular Payne Avenue diner, damaged in Monday evening fire Magnolias Restaurant, popular Payne Avenue diner, damaged in Monday evening fire Trending Nationally Largest COVID vaccine study yet finds links to health conditions Girl killed in sand hole on Lauderdale-by-the-Sea identified; lifeguards could have prevented tragedy, experts say After killing sex worker in SoHo hotel, man busted in Arizona stabbings: cops Syphilis cases spike in Florida, especially in Orange County Brooklyn-born ‘Porky’s’ star Tony Ganios dead at 64 from cardiac arrest after spinal cord surgery",
