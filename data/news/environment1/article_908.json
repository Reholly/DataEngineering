    "text": "Chad Gillis They have stumpy legs with strong feet designed for digging massive holes in sandy dunes. Gopher tortoises are among Florida's most ancient-looking critters, and they thrive at places like Bowditch Point Park at the north end of Fort Myers Beach. Bowditch has plenty of grassy hills, perfect places for gopher tortoises to dig out their fortresses; but it's thought that many or all of the tortoises that were there were washed away by Hurricane Ian in September 2022. At least one gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) survived the storm or was transported to the park afterwards as one was recently photographed by The News-Press. The only tortoise native to Florida, gopher tortoises are icons on tall, hilly dunes and scrubby pine and palmetto uplands. They're long-lived animals that mature around the same rate as humans. From tiny to 90 \"Gopher tortoises can live 40 to 60 years in the wild, though captive tortoises may live 90-plus years,\" an FWC website says. \"Males reach adulthood at approximately 9 to 12 years of age, whereas a female may take 10 to 21 years to reach maturity depending on local resource abundance and latitude.\" Listed as threatened by the state, gopher tortoises are most active during the warmer months. Hatchlings are smaller than a nectarine, and they're considered juveniles when their carapace (shell) reaches 2-and-a-half inches in length, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, the state agency charged with protecting wildlife and habitat. At that age and size their shells are still soft, and the coloration is mostly yellow to almost orange. They're subadults when they reach 5 inches in length, and their shells are starting to harden. The coloration at this stage turns much darker, into a dark olive green to grey.

These burrows eventually become home to all sorts of animals, and they are climate controlled, to a degree. \"Their burrows maintain a stable temperature and humidity year-round, providing protection from extreme temperatures, drought, and fire,\" FWC says. They eat low-lying vegetation like long-leafed grasses and legumes, and they don't drink a lot of water. \"They typically forage within 160 feet of their burrow but will travel farther if forage is unavailable,\" FWC says. \"Gopher tortoises may drink water that has pooled following a rainstorm, but generally consume an adequate amount of water from forage plants.\" More: [Millions of birds aren't feeding on Florida's largest lake. What is going wrong?](/story/news/environment/2024/02/01/more-el-nino-rains-could-lead-to-lake-releases-for-caloosahatchee/72399649007/) Threats to the species come mostly from humans and development, according to a federal agency responsible for protecting wildlife and habitat. \"Primary threats to the gopher tortoise are fragmentation, destruction and modification of its habitat, including urbanization,\" a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service website reads. \"Other threats include mortality due to vehicle strikes; effects of climate change including increased drought and extreme high temperatures, sea level rise and migration of human populations from inundated coastal areas; and nonnative invasive species, disease and predation, mainly on nests and hatchlings.\" Connect with this reporter: Chad Gillis on Facebook.",
