    "text": "Nanaimo streets are set to be adorned with functional art – new manhole covers designed by Snuneymuxw artists. The City of Nanaimo is collaborating with Ay Lelum - The Good House of Design and Joel Good to honour Snuneymuxw First Nation culture with three new utility covers, which “serve as a unique canvas for Snuneymuxw art,” according to a city press release. The storm cover design features two supernatural eagles, representing strength and protection; the new sanitary cover design shows a frog due to their ability to purify natural water sources; and the water cover design highlights an orca, symbolizing power and strength. “From an ancestral lens, art holds important knowledge and reminds us of our connection and responsibilities to the natural world. We extend our gratitude to our Snuneymuxw artists who generously share their gifts with the community,” noted Snuneymuxw Chief Michael Wyse in the release. According to the release, the new utility covers will be installed in the city over the coming months and years, aiming to provide residents and visitors with the opportunity to experience Snuneymuxw art throughout Nanaimo. The city noted, in an e-mail, that only new installations will receive the new covers and there is no intent to replace all existing covers with the designs.
