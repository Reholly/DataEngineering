    "text": "Clean energy powered by Aussie ingenuity\nThe Albanese Government has awarded $14 million to Powering Australia Limited to establish the Powering Australia Industry Growth Centre to help Australian businesses manufacture renewable energy technologies locally, fulfilling an election commitment.\nThe Centre will fund activities and provide services to:\n- help commercialise locally manufactured renewable energy technologies and ideas;\n- encourage connections between critical minerals producers and renewable technology manufacturers;\n- include a First Nations Advisor to build First Nations business management capabilities in renewable technologies.\nThe centre delivers on our election commitment under the Australia Made Battery Plan, to provide advanced technology and skills development to businesses looking to locally manufacture renewable technologies.\nIt also builds on the Government’s suite of support for the renewable technology industry, including Powering Australia, Rewiring the Nation and a Future Made in Australia.\nThe centre also aligns with the National Reconstruction Fund’s priority area of renewables, value adding in resources and low-emissions technologies.\nQuotes attributable to the Hon Ed Husic, Minister for Industry and Science:\n“Batteries, renewables and other low-emissions technologies offer huge opportunities for Australian industry to create jobs and the sovereign capabilities critical to our economic success.\n“This $14 million investment is targeted support to grow Aussie know-how in these emerging areas.\n“It aligns with what we’re doing with our $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund, which has renewable and low-emissions technologies as one of its priority investment areas, once again demonstrating how Government linking up policies can better support Australian industry.”",
