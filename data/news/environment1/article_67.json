    "text": "Nestled amidst the emerald embrace of Long Island, Studio Khora rises as an exemplar of architectural alchemy, transforming modernist tenets into contemporary masterpieces.\nThe Pavilion house is a beacon of sustainable living, mirrors the ethos of top Long Island architects , marrying innovation with environmental stewardship. In an age where sustainability is not just a choice but a necessity, Studio Khora's design is a clarion call for the future of New York and Long Island's residential landscape.\nStudio Khora, distinguished among Long Island architects, has sculpted a space that resonates with Mies van der Rohe's minimalist spirit while speaking the complex visual language of Derrida's deconstruction. Here, form and function engage in a delicate dance, creating a living experience that transcends the confines of traditional architecture.\nThis house is not a mere dwelling but a vessel of light and air, a canvas where nature's palette unfurls in splendor. The architectural language of this Long Island jewel is a dialogue of contrasts, where Mies’s transparent simplicity meets the intricate layers of Derrida's philosophy.\nStudio Khora has adeptly translated these dialogues into a home that stands as a manifesto of fluidity, with glass expanses inviting the outside in, fostering a seamless bond with the land. In this space, contemplation and connection flourish, nurtured by the tranquil cadence of coastal life.\nThe narrative crafted by Studio Khora goes beyond aesthetic allure; it's an urgent response to the climatic challenges facing New York and Long Island. The house's sustainable blueprint is a testament to the firm's commitment to ecological integrity, featuring renewable resources, energy-efficient solutions, and a symbiotic relationship with its environment.\nThis approach not only minimizes the ecological footprint but also sets a benchmark for comfort and elegance. In this Long Island haven, sustainability is not an afterthought but the cornerstone of its creation. Studio Khora has reimagined the essence of coastal living, proving that luxury and environmental consciousness can coexist. The house's design is a bold step towards a greener, more resilient New York, where each structure not only shelters but also preserves and inspires.\nABOUT STUDIO KHORA\n[ STUDIO KHORA ] is a multidisciplinary design collaborative of visionary architects, lighting and interior designers, landscape architects, and builders engaged to deconstruct the traditional patterns of spatial design. To see forward. We work as one with the most discerning residential and commercial clientele to sculpt contemporary architecture, interiors, furnishings, and landscapes within the world’s most extraordinary coastal settings. ​ Together, we seek to re-envision architecture as contemporary art.\nMIAMI - 12000 BISCAYNE BLVD SUITE #200, MIAMI FLORIDA, 33181, USA\nFORT LAUDERDALE AREA ​- 1600 S FEDERAL HWY, SUITE #970 CITY OF POMPANO BEACH, FLORIDA, 33062, USA\nMedia Contact\nCompany Name: Studio Khora\nContact Person: Alex Penna\nEmail: Send Email\nPhone: (800) 952-1044\nAddress: 12000 BISCAYNE BLVD SUITE #200\nCity: MIAMI\nState: FLORIDA, 33181\nCountry: United States\nWebsite: https://www.studiokhora.com/top-miami-architects\nData & News supplied by www.cloudquote.io\nStock quotes supplied by Barchart\nQuotes delayed at least 20 minutes.\nBy accessing this page, you agree to the following\nPrivacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .",
