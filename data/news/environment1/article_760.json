    "text": "2023 ANNUAL RESULTS\nSubstantially higher nuclear power output in France\nGood overall operational performance\nNew commercial policy\nNet financial debt reduced\nTrajectory 1.5°C validated by Moody’s\n|Performance|\nSales: €139.7 bn\nEBITDA: €39.9 bn\nEBIT: €13.2 bn\nNet income - Group share: €10.0 bn\nNet Financial Debt: €54.4 bn – NFD / EBITDA: 1.36x\nAdjusted Economic Debt: €86.3 bn – AED / adjusted EBITDA: 2.26x\nThe exceptional results of the Group were driven by a very good operational performance, achieving a significant 41.4TWh increase in nuclear generation in France in a context of historically high prices. Coming after the sudden drop in nuclear power output in France in 2022 due to the stress corrosion phenomenon and exceptional regulatory measures to limit price rises for consumers, these results have reduced net financial debt.\nIn 2023, EDF began key actions for the future\nNew commercial policy\nTo give its customers more price visibility and be more competitive, the Group is rolling out a new business policy involving 4 and 5 year ahead auctions on the wholesale market, and medium-term power supply contracts. The Group is also developing long-term industrial partnerships relating to the historic nuclear fleet (nuclear generation allocation contracts).\nSupporting customers’ efforts to reduce their carbon footprint:\nProducing more low-carbon electricity:\nExpanding the networks to address to the challenges of the energy transition:\nDeveloping flexibility solutions to meet electricity system requirements, via:\nAt its meeting of 15 February 2024, chaired by Luc Rémont, EDF’s Board of Directors approved the consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2023. Luc Rémont, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of EDF, said: “2023 marks the return of the company’s operational performance at a better level, after a year of industrial difficulties and exceptional regulation unfavourable effects in 2022. With these good results, EDF has met its financial targets and reduced its financial debt. They also reflect the hard work put in by all EDF’s teams to turn generation levels around, and provide appropriate sales offers for customers, and innovative solutions in response to the needs of the electricity system. Finally, 2023 saw the start of key actions for the company’s future, with an intensive focus on change and efficiency improvements so we can remain the leader in carbon-free, competitive electricity production that is available at all times. I am certain that all these steps will continue to bring benefits over the next few years.”\n2026 targets (9)\nNet financial debt / EBITDA: ≤ 2.5x\nAdjusted economic debt / Adjusted EBITDA (10): ≤ 4x\nKey financial results:\n- EBITDA\n|(in millions of euros)||2022||2023||Organic change|\n|France - Generation and supply||-23,144||24,677||N/A|\n|France - Regulated activities||6,723||3,707||-44.9%|\n|EDF Renewables||909||932||2.8%|\n|Dalkia||333||407||22.8%|\n|Framatome||328||255||-25.3%|\n|United Kingdom||1,325||3,967||x3|\n|Italy||1,115||1,855||65.3%|\n|Other international||336||872||x2.6|\n|Other activities||7,089||3,255||-52.2%|\n|Group total||-4,986||39,927||N/A|\nThe gradual recovery of nuclear power generation in France, the high-price environment in Europe (entailing a record ARENH scheme cropping price), and the absence of regulatory measures of the kind introduced in 2022 were the main explanations for the exceptional (almost €45 billion) improvement in EBITDA to €39.9 million in 2023. The other businesses’ operational performances also contributed. The United Kingdom registered a good performance, particularly in sales. In Italy, most business segments contributed to this rise in EBITDA, and Dalkia’s sales performance was also very satisfactory.\n- Net income\nThe financial result for 2023 was an expense of €3.3 billion, a slight improvement of €0.2 billion from 2022 explained by:\n- a good performance by the dedicated asset portfolio, which achieved a return of 10.2% (vs -8.5% in 2022) thanks to favourable developments on the financial markets, particularly the equity markets in 2023 leading to a €6.5 billion improvement in other financial income and expenses (with a limited cash impact);\n- a €4.2 billion increase in the cost of unwinding the discount, principally owing to stability in the real discount rate applied for nuclear provisions in 2023 after the positive impact of a 50bp rate increase in 2022 (with no cash impact);\n- a €2.1 billion increase in the cost of gross financial debt, primarily reflecting a significant increase in interest rates (with a cash effect of €1.8 billion).\nThe financial result excluding non-recurring items, particularly the change in fair value of the dedicated asset portfolio, was -€5.6 billion, a decrease of €5.4 billion.\nNet income excluding non-recurring items stood at €18.5 billion, up by €31.1 billion in line with the significant growth in EBITDA after the corporate income tax expense (an income tax credit was booked in 2022).\nThe Group’s net income totalled €10.0 billion, up by nearly €28 billion. Apart from the large increase in net income excluding non-recurring items, the principal items after tax contributing to this change are:\n- the €4.0 billion change in the fair value of financial instruments;\n- €7.9 billion of impairment on the Hinkley Point C project and EDF Energy’s goodwill in 2023, in view of the new schedule and additional costs announced in January 2024.\n- Cash flow\nCash flow for 2023 amounted to €9.3 billion, versus -€24.6 million in 2022. This is explained by cash EBITDA of €43.9 billion resulting from a good operating performance and a very high price effect. It also benefited from the closing in 2023 of trading positions taken in 2022, with an effect of €5.3 billion.\nWorking capital requirement increased by €7.8 billion, comprising:\n- €5.1 billion for optimisation of trading, mainly reflecting the repayment of margin calls as positions were closed in 2023.\n- €3.9 billion due to the 2023 CSPE receivable generated by France’s tariff shield, which was offset by lower revenues from purchase obligations in a context of declining prices, compensation payments by the French State for 2023 charges, and the regularisation of excess compensation of previous years.\nThis cash flow funded net investments of €19.1 billion, €2.7 billion more than in 2022 due notably to the Hinkley Point C project, extensive maintenance work on the nuclear fleet, and network growth.\n- Net financial debt\nNet financial debt (1) totalled €54.4 billion at 31 December 2023, a decrease of €10.1 billion compared to end-2022. As well as the positive cash flow, the €2.4 billion conversion of OCEANE bonds reinforced EDF’s equity.\nThe bond issues of 2023, totalling around €8 billion, the lower level of short-term debt, and early repayments of bank loans lengthened the maturity of the Group’s financial debt to 11 years at 31 December 2023 (versus 9.4 years at 31 December 2022).\nEDF received the 2024 International Financing Review (IFR) “Corporate Issuer of the Year” award for its issues in 2023.\nFinancial results by segment:\nSegment sales are presented before elimination of inter-segment operations.\n- France - Generation and supply\n|(in millions of euros)||2022||2023||Organic change|\n|Sales||48,686||64,244||31.9%|\n|EBITDA||-23,144||24,677||N/A|\nThe considerable increase in EBITDA was driven by the gradual recovery by nuclear generation, with a favourable effect of €5.7 billion.\nIn 2022, the exceptional regulatory measures introduced by the French government to limit rises in sales prices to consumers had an adverse effect on EBITDA estimated at -€8.2 billion.\nThe lower nuclear output in 2022 had led to purchases of large volumes at very high market prices, but this effect was much smaller in 2023, generating a positive impact of €7.3 billion.\nAlso, the rise in prices had an impact of €12.1 billion for final consumers and €12.5 billion covered by the tariff shield. This effect is largely explained by the average forward market price for the past 2 years, which was €218/MWh in 2023 compared to €71/MWh in 2022, and an ARENH cropping price of €410/MWh in 2023, versus €257/MWh in 2022.\n- France - Regulated activities (2)\n| |\n(in millions of euros)\n|2022||2023||Organic change|\n|Sales||18,082||19,413||7.4%|\n|EBITDA||6,723||3,707||-44.9%|\n|Including Enedis||5,864||2,699||-54.0%|\nThe decrease in EBITDA is principally explained by a negative price effect estimated at €1.3 billion, caused by purchases of network losses made at very high market prices (this additional cost will be compensated by future tariff increases). However, changes in the TURPE network access tariff had a favourable effect estimated at €0.7 billion (3).\nAlso, in 2022 a €1.7 billion payment was received from RTE (4), corresponding to a share of interconnection fees, and there was no equivalent receipt in 2023.\nThe 8.2TWh decline in volumes distributed (excluding the weather effect) had a limited negative impact on EBITDA estimated at €0.1 billion.\n- EDF Renewables - Renewable Energies\nGroup renewables excluding hydropower in France\n|(in millions of euros)||2022||2023||Organic change|\n|Sales||3,647||3,636||4.6%|\n|EBITDA||1,191||1,712||43.6%|\n|Net investments||1,894||2,016||6.4%|\nContribution by EDF Renewables\n|(in millions of euros)||2022||2023||Organic change|\n|Sales||2,158||2,031||2.6%|\n|EBITDA||909||932||2.8%|\n|Including EBITDA for generation||1,246||1,234||1.8%|\nThe increase in EBITDA for Group Renewables is attributable to a 14% increase in wind and solar power output thanks to new capacities installed that brought total net capacity to 15.1GW at end-2023. In Italy and Belgium, hydropower output also rose substantially in a favourable price environment.\nAt EDF Renewables, EBITDA for generation increased due to 10.9% higher volume output following the commissioning of new plants in 2022 and 2023, despite less favourable wind conditions, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. The downturn in prices only affected the plants that are exposed to market prices.\nInvestments by Group Renewables were higher than in 2022, particularly due to development of large-scale solar plants in the United States (including Fox Squirrel - 753MW gross and Desert Quartzite - 527MW gross), in the United Kingdom and wind farms in Brazil (Eólico Serra do Seridó and Serra das Almas).\n- Dalkia - Energy Services\nGroup Energy Services (5)\n|(in millions of euros)||2022||2023||Organic change|\n|Sales||8,578||8,618||0.6%|\n|EBITDA||440||535||18.2%|\n|Net investments||572||589||3%|\nContribution by Dalkia\n|(in millions of euros)||2022||2023||Organic change|\n|Sales||6,663||6,395||-3.6%|\n|EBITDA||333||407||22.8%|\nThe service activities of Dalkia, Sowee and Izivia in France and the Edison Next activity in Italy all contributed to the increase in EBITDA for the Group Energy Services.\nAt Dalkia, the rise in EBITDA is attributable to the business performance, particularly in energy efficiency services and decarbonisation in France. Also, Dalkia’s co-generation plants were in operation over the whole first quarter in 2023 (in 2022, Dalkia was affected by early shutdowns due to a shortened winter tariff period).\nThe rise in investments mainly concerned Dalkia and Edison Next.\n- Framatome\n|(in millions of euros)||2022||2023||Organic change|\n|Sales||4,122||4,066||-2.0%|\n|EBITDA||589||597||-0.3%|\n|Contribution to EDF group EBITDA||328||255||-25.3%|\nThe change in EBITDA is explained by an increase in Installed Base services provided on behalf of EDF, and the ramping up of new nuclear projects in France and the United Kingdom. The contribution to Group EBITDA was lower, essentially in North America (financial difficulties with performance of a safety Instrumentation & Control renovation contract, and a temporary downturn in production by the nuclear fuel assembly plant).\nOrder intake amounted to approximately €4.8 billion at end-2023, higher than in 2022. The rise is mainly attributable to the Installed Base business in North America.\nFramatome and Naval Group completed the acquisition of Jeumont Electric in late 2023. This operation consolidates Framatome’s activities in the nuclear energy sector, by integrating a supplier specialising in production and maintenance of motors and equipment for the energy sector.\n- United Kingdom\n|(in millions of euros)||2022||2023||Organic change|\n|Sales||16,098||21,132||33.3%|\n|EBITDA||1,325||3,967||x3|\nThe increase in EBITDA was driven, in particular, by sales performance in the medium and large business segments, which helped to strengthen margins and market share. Allowances in the domestic default tariff cap led to a recovery of margins in the residential market, allowing suppliers to recuperate some of the costs incurred at the height of the energy crisis.\nOperational performance was strong for the generating business, where the higher realised nuclear prices offset lower power generation of 37.3TWh, down by 6.3TWh, following the shutdown of Hinkley Point B (-4.1TWh) in August 2022 and a more intense maintenance programme than in 2022.\n- Italy\n|(in millions of euros)||2022||2023||Organic change|\n|Sales||29,302||17,787||-39.5%|\n|EBITDA||1,115||1,855||65.3%|\nIn Italy, the increase in EBITDA in the electricity generation business was driven by better renewable energy output, especially in hydropower generation thanks to better hydrological conditions. However, this trend was mitigated by an unfavourable price effect in thermal generation.\nIn the sales activities, margins recovered across all customer segments.\nFinally, the gas business benefited from effective optimisation of the supply contract portfolio, despite the strong negative impact of non-delivery of agreed LNG supplies from the United States.\nWind and solar power capacities totalled 650MW net (6) at end-2023.\n- Other international\n|(in millions of euros)||2022||2023||Organic change|\n|Sales||5,659||5,583||-1.7%|\n|EBITDA||336||872||x2.5|\n|Including: - Belgium||118||673||x6|\n|- Brazil||225||210||-7.6%|\nThe rise in EBITDA in Belgium (7) is explained by better nuclear power output (+6%) compared to 2022, a year when results were affected by energy purchases at high prices and outage at the Chooz power plant. Generation was also up for hydropower (+54%) and wind power (+29%) in a high-price environment.\nWind power capacities totalled 633MW net (8) at end-2023.\nIn Brazil, EBITDA was down slightly due to the downturn in system services and an unfavourable spot price effect, despite the +5% adjustment to the Power Purchase Agreement attached to EDF’s Norte Fluminense plant in November 2022.\n- Other activities\n|(in millions of euros)||2022||2023||Organic |\nchange\n|Sales||19,724||7,677||-59.7%|\n|EBITDA||7,089||3,255||-52.2%|\n|Including: - gas activities||606||-66||-110.9%|\n|- EDF Trading||6,407||3,230||-47.5%|\nLower prices and lower levels of business at the Dunkirk terminal, after an exceptional year in 2022 with very high prices on the wholesale markets, explain the sharp decrease in EBITDA for the gas activities.\nIn a context of market and counterparty risks decline, EDF Trading achieved excellent performances, well above the pre-energy crisis levels of 2021. These performances were mainly achieved through good diversification, although the contribution to EBITDA was down from 2022 due to falling prices and lower volatility on the wholesale markets in 2023.\nExtract from the consolidated financial statements\nConsolidated income statement\n|(in millions of euros)||2023||2022|\n|Sales||139,715||143,476|\n|Fuel and energy
