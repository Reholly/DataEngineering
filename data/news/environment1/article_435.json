    "text": "Success! We help secure higher protection for endangered porpoise at UN meeting\nWe are very excited to report that our work with other partner organisations has helped secure the highest level of protection for a critically endangered population of common\nharbour porpoise in the central Baltic Sea, and off the Iberian Peninsula.\nOnly a few hundred of these porpoises are left alive and effective measures to enable their recovery have been lacking. But, following our hard work to change this perilous situation, the UN Convention of Migratory Species (CMS COP14) has agreed today to include the Baltic Proper harbour porpoise in its Appendix I category (the highest protection status), which formally recognises the population as critically endangered and means emergency measures can now be taken to save them.\nWhale and Dolphin Conservation, Humane Society International, Coalition Clean Baltic and ORCA made a decisive contribution to the decision, submitting a\njoint report to CMS calling for stronger protections for these specific harbour porpoise populations, and to restore their habitats. As a result, the CMS member states of the EU submitted a proposal for the harbour porpoise to be included in Appendix I of the Convention.\nThis new protection status enables priority conservation measures to be taken to prevent, remove or mitigate obstacles to their seasonal migration and to control other factors that might endanger their survival. The main threats to the Baltic proper harbour porpoise include bycatch, underwater noise and pollution.\nThe harbour porpoise is one of the smallest species within the larger family of cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises). Previously, we conducted an awareness-raising\ncampaign for the Baltic Proper harbour porpoise with the aim of achieving a year-round ban on gillnets in marine protected areas. A petition with more than 100,000 signatures was submitted to the German government in September 2021. We also initiated an open letter to the German government, signed by more than 100 cetacean experts from around the world, calling for effective measures to protect the Baltic Proper harbour porpoise. Our educational work continues to this day.",
