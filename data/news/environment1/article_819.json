    "text": "Solvang, a Seatrium Favoured Customer Contract (FCC) partner, intends to pilot the system on board the 21,289 cu metre gas carrier over a twelve-month period from installation during the third quarter of this year. If the project proves successful, the company plans to install CCS systems aboard other vessels in its 22-ship gas carrier fleet. The system, based on amine cleaning technology, will capture about 70% of the carbon dioxide in the ship’s exhaust gas, involving the entire value chain for handling the carbon gas, including liquefaction and storage on board the vessel. Seatrium’s work scope will include design, engineering, procurement of the CCS unit, upgrades to the ship’s electrical and automation systems, and integration of the carbon capture, compression and storage system. Solvang’s Fleet Director, Tor Ask, commented: “Solvang is pleased to partner with Seatrium for our full-scale pilot project for CO2 capture on board Clipper Eris. We have enjoyed many years of successful partnerships and Seatrium has a strong track record for decarbonisation retrofit works, including the installation of exhaust gas cleaning system for four of our very large gas carriers … If the pilot project is successful, Solvang intends to install the technology on some of our vessels, including newbuilds, thereby contributing to a faster take-up of the technology.” Alvin Gan, Executive Vice President of Seatrium Repairs and Upgrades, said: “We are excited to be part of this game-changing world’s first full-scale turnkey CCS retrofit … Our collaboration with Solvang on Clipper Eris will further boost our strong track record in the areas of maritime decarbonisation upgrades and retrofits which are expected to continue to grow in the coming years.” The project marks the latest initiative in Seatrium’s supply of sustainable installations including low carbon energy saving retrofits and environmental regulatory works. The company has supplied more than 500 such projects since 2018. Copyright © 2024. All rights reserved. Seatrade, a trading name of Informa Markets (UK) Limited. | |",
