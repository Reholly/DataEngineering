In line with the Carbon Neutrality Target by 2035, our Company reduced over 33 percent of its carbon emissions in FY23 and nearly 1,306 tCO2e emissions have been avoided by switching to green power and other energy efficiency initiatives across our branches till the end of Q3FY24. We have also financed nearly 25,650 Electric Vehicles till the end of Q3FY24, a 65 percent increase compared to Q3FY23. In addition to the Scope 1 & Scope 2 reduction initiatives we also strengthened our reporting by increased mapping of our Scope 3 emissions. These factors have helped us drive an improvement in the CDP score.\" LTFH has been reporting to CDP India since 2020 on Climate Change.
