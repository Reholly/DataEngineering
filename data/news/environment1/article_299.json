    "text": "David Fink follows a line of straw and uses a baler in one of his fields Wednesday, Aug. 2, 2023, at Heidel Hollow Farm in Germansville.\nFive Lehigh Valley farms, totaling more than 230 acres, will be preserved under a state investment program that protects them from future residential or commercial development.\nGov. Josh Shapiro’s office recently announced that more than 1,500 acres on 22 farms in 11 counties were part of a $5.8 million investment using state, county and local funds.\nPennsylvania partners with county and local governments and nonprofits to buy development rights so farm owners ensure their farms will remain farms and never be sold to developers.\nLehigh County ranks fourth statewide in the number of farms preserved and is fifth in total acreage. It expects the 400th farm to be preserved this spring. According to the county’s website, 397 farms covering more than 27,600 acres have been preserved. The county has allocated $1 million per year for the purchase of development rights and is looking to keep that amount through 2026.\nNorthampton County has a similar program. According to its website, through May 2023, it preserved 251 farms covering more than 19,000 acres since 1989.\nFor this round, Lehigh County had an investment of $1.64 million, including $220,000 from the state and $1.42 million from the county.\nFarms included were:\nWilliam G. and Cheryl C. Ash and Brian Brady, a Heidelberg Township horse farm. Weinhofer Farms LLC, a 154-acre crop farm in Whitehall Township. Errol W. and Virginia A. Zellner, Brenda Kay and Robert Price, a 28-acre crop farm in Washington Township. Northampton County had an investment of $552,770 from the state.\nFarms included were:\nJody L. and Megan M. Snyder, a 33-acre crop farm in Lehigh Township. Weinhofer Farms LLC No. 3, a 16-acre crop farm in East Allen Township. Pennsylvania leads the nation in preserved farmland. Since 1988, the state has protected 6,336 farms and 634,375 acres in 58 counties from development, investing nearly $1.69 billion in state, county and local funds.\nOutside of the Lehigh Valley, farmland was also preserved in Adams, Centre, Cumberland, Lancaster, Lebanon, Luzerne, Schuylkill, Union and York counties\nMorning Call reporter Evan Jones can be reached at [email protected] .\n©2024 The Morning Call.
