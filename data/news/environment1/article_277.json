Nova Minerals identifies gold up to 20.9 g/t gold at the Tomahawk and Trundle prospects of the Estelle Gold Project NVA +3.99% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio Add to Watchlist Add Position Position added successfully to:\nPlease name your holdings portfolio Type: BUY SELL Date: Amount: Price Point Value: Leverage: 1:1 1:10 1:25 1:50 1:100 1:200 1:400 1:500 1:1000 Commission: Create New Watchlist Create Create a new holdings portfolio Add Create + Add another position Close Nova Minerals Ltd (ASX:NVA, OTCQB:NVAAF) has identified more gold at the Tomahawk and Trundle prospects, just north and west of the new Wombat prospect of the Estelle Gold Project in the US.\nThe company has used a combination of field observations and assay results from surface samples to confirm the presence of gold-bearing quartz veins at the Tomahawk and Trundle prospects.\nThe samples included 43 rock and 35 soil samples which showed anomalous gold, copper and antimony mineralisation with six rocks of more than 5 g/t with a high of 20.9 g/t gold.\nThere were also five rocks of over 2% copper with a high of 10.5% copper, and nine rocks of more than 0.1% antimony with a high of 2.6% antimony and six soils of more than 0.5 g/t gold with a high of 1.3 g/t gold.\n“Mineralisation identified at Trundle and Tomahawk contribute to the developing 35km long Estelle gold trend,” Nova Minerals head of exploration Hans Hoffman said.\n“Chasing the large veins at Wombat led us straight north to Tomahawk, and the iron-stained intrusive rocks at Trundle was an obvious target just west of Wombat.\n“With a long list of prospects from Korbel in the north to RPM in the south, these new results warrant follow-up reconnaissance mapping and sampling.”\nHighly mineralised prospects\n“These results now confirm Trundle and Tomahawk as highly mineralised prospects in not only gold, but copper, silver and antimony as well,” Nova Minerals CEO Christopher Gerteisen said.\n“These prospects have always been an area of interest for us exhibiting all the indicative features of mineralisation, including striking surface colour, alteration, and vein density anomalies, which is now confirmed through sample analysis.\n“This shows us the value of our systematic surface exploration programs which continue across the Estelle Project.\n“The claim block is 513 square kilometres and we have only scratched the surface. As we proceed into 2024 and beyond with further exploration work, we expect additional prospects to be discovered with both gold and critical and strategic element potential.\n“This aggressive ongoing exploration approach, which to date has identified over 20 known mineralised prospects, provides the company with decades of project longevity, with a pipeline of potential resources for future production scenarios.\n“As we move forward, we will prioritise this prospect portfolio for advancement towards resource definition.”\nNova says both prospects contain dominant northwest striking, steeply dipping vein orientation as seen elsewhere on the project.\nRead more on Proactive Investors AU\nDisclaimer\nNova Minerals identifies gold up to 20.9 g/t gold at the Tomahawk and Trundle prospects of the Estelle Gold Project",
