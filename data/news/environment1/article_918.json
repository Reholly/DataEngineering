As in all Marquis Who's Who biographical volumes, individuals profiled are selected on the basis of current reference value.

Drawing on expertise in clean energy, fossil fuel, coal and natural gas, he oversees his company in its mission to provide clean energy solutions and sustainability consulting to clients in various sectors, including business, municipal, education and manufacturing.
