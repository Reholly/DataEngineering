    "text": "Last month, award-winning author Kim Stanley Robinson spoke at the David Brower Center about weaving themes from ecological sustainability and social justice into science fiction.\nHosted by the Berkeley Climate Change Network, the event offered attendees a chance to hear about Robinson’s book, The Ministry for the Future . The novel is set in the near future and uses fictional eyewitness accounts to tell how climate change will affect us all. Robinson also discussed his latest book, The High Sierra: A Love Story , which explores the beauty of California’s High Sierra.\nThe conversation was moderated by Sociology professor Daniel Aldana Cohen , whose research on the climate emergency intersects with topics like inequities and the political economy, and English professor Katherine Snyder , who studies post-apocalyptic novels and recently led a research seminar on climate change fiction.\nAdditional co-sponsors included Rausser College of Natural Resources, the Center for Interdisciplinary Critical Inquiry, the Graduate School of Journalism, the Department of English, the Socio-Spatial Climate Collaborative, and the Townsend Center for the Humanities.",
