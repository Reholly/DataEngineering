    "text": "Yamaha Motor Recognized with Highest Score from CDP for Transparency on Climate Change February 16, 2024 IWATA, February 16, 2024 - Yamaha Motor Co., Ltd. (Tokyo: 7272) has been recognized for leadership in corporate transparency and performance on climate change by global environment non-profit CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project), securing a place on its A List for 2023. This is the first time that Yamaha Motor has achieved an 'A' score from the organization. CDP is an international non-profit organization that runs the world's environmental disclosure system for companies, municipalities, and more. CDP scores are widely used to drive investment and procurement decisions toward a more sustainable and resilient net-zero economy. In 2023, a record-breaking 23,000 companies (including 1,985 Japanese companies) responded to requests for information from financial institutions, purchasing companies, and organizations through the CDP and disclosed data related to climate change, forests, and water security. Of these, Yamaha Motor became one of just 346 companies (including 109 Japanese companies) to receive an 'A' score for its climate change transparency. Yamaha Motor seeks to resolve societal issues in the unique style of Yamaha and to develop businesses that contribute to the achievement of SDGs under our Long-Term Vision for 2030 of \"ART for Human Possibilities.\" In the field of climate change, the Company has set carbon neutrality as a goal in the Yamaha Motor Group Environmental Plan 2050. Going forward, while prioritizing harmony with regions, societies, and the global environment, Yamaha Motor will continue to pursue initiatives for creating a sustainable world and strive to be a company trusted by stakeholders. ■List of companies that received an A score from the CDP in 2023 ■Contact us from the Press Corporate Communication Division, PR group: +81-538-32-1145 ■News Center: CDP is an international non-profit organization that runs the world's environmental disclosure system for companies, municipalities, and more.
