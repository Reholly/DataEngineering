These new kits are the QIAwave RNA Plus Mini Kit and QIAwave DNA/RNA Mini Kit that are used in labs around the world. In awarding the ACT (Accountability, Consistency, and Transparency) labels, My Green Lab found that the two new QIAwave products had an up to 27% improvement in the Environmental Impact Factor when compared to the respective QIAGEN standard kits. - QIAGEN’s R&D lab for Sample technologies at its European operational headquarters in Hilden, Germany, has achieved the Platinum certification level in a review by My Green Lab. This certification provides scientists and lab-supporting teams with actionable ways to make meaningful changes, reduce costs, preserve resources, and ensure a safe, healthy environment in support of science. QIAGEN has set a roadmap to have all of its Life Sciences labs at the Hilden site certified by My Green Lab. „My Green Lab puts the spotlight on companies to meet planet Earth’s immense ecological challenges head-on. We at QIAGEN take that challenge very seriously. The recognition of our eco-friendlier kits and the Platinum certification of our Sample technologies lab are proof points of our commitment to sustainability and important milestones in our campaign to significantly reduce the environmental impact of our entire product range,” said Nitin Sood, Senior Vice President and Head of QIAGEN’s Life Science Business Area. In early 2023, QIAGEN’s emissions reduction targets were validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), and the company committed to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050. In 2022, the company surpassed its target for a 9% reduction in plastic usage with a 16.5% decrease. QIAGEN aims to reduce plastic packaging waste by a further 7% in 2023. QIAGEN’s commitment to sustainability and responsible business practices has been recognized by independent rating agencies such as ISS-ESG, which recently elevated QIAGEN’s rating to B-, reaffirming its „Prime“ status, and MSCI ESG Research, which gave QIAGEN a grade A. Sustainalytics ESG Risk Ratings placed the company in the low-risk group.
