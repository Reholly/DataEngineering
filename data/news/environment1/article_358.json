    "text": "New litter abatement department aims to clean up Livingston Parish LIVINGSTON PARISh, La. (WAFB) - It’s not a sight anyone wants to see — roads and waterways littered with trash — but it’s something Livingston Parish residents are having to look at and live with. “It is easy to see: There is a lot of litter. It causes safety issues, diseases and flooding,” said Livingston Parish President Randy Delatte. Delatte decided to do something about it. The newly-elected parish president is forming a litter abatement department under his administration. “People are concerned. There are things we have to attack, and attack it now,” Delatte explained. To run the new department, he has appointed Lynda Gardiner, the director of “Keep Livingston Beautiful” — an organization already dedicated to keeping the area clean. “We did a litter study last year. We were in the top two,” Gardiner said. This puts Livingston Parish as one of the top two parishes in the state facing a severe litter problem, and that’s not a place Gardiner wants to be. She says litter is stopping the parish from growing. “It reflects the parish. It has stopped businesses from coming in,” Gardiner explained. One of the key early initiatives for the litter abatement department will be to work with the Livingston Parish Sheriff’s Office and 21st Judicial District Court. “The 21st Judicial requires litter pickup for people that have community service work. We don’t have a mechanism to do that yet. The sheriff has trustees doing that,” Delatte added. [Click here](mailto:typo@wafb.com) to report a typo. Copyright 2024 WAFB. All rights reserved.",
