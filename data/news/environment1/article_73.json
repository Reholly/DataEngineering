    "text": "HANCEVILLE â€” During the late stages of the game Thursday morning, the Hartselle girls basketball team never batted an eye.\nFacing off against Muscle Shoals in the first round of the Class 6A Northwest Regional tournament, the Tigers found themselves in a battle late in the game.\nLike all great teams do though, Hartselle made the shots when it mattered and it resulted in a 50-46 win.\n\"When you get to this level you have to find ways to win,\" said Hartselle head coach Amber Deline. \"These girls know how to fight when their backs are against the wall and today proved that.\"\nHartselle stayed in comfortable control for the first three quarters, building a 35-25 lead late in the third. However, an 11-0 run by Muscle Shoals gave the Trojans their first lead early in the fourth and forced Hartselle into a timeout.\n\"We were rattled and we just needed to calm down,\" Deline said.\nAfter that, Hartselle continually made clutch shot after shot until it ended with Anna Hampton Burroughs sinking two free throws with eight seconds remaining to seal the win.\nFreshman Hannah Burks led the Tigers in scoring with 17 points, while junior Gracie Hill added 15. Junior Mary Frances Itsede had a double-double with 12 points and 11 rebounds.\nThree-point shooting was key for the Tigers in Thursday's game and started in the opening minutes of the game when Hill pulled up from behind the men's college 3-point line and swished a shot.\n\"'I'm not going to lie, I was surprised when it went in,\" Hill said with a laugh. \"I guess it was the adrenaline.\"\n\"When she shot it I was thinking 'oh no,' but then she made it so I was like, 'Alright, let's go,'\" Deline added.\nTom Drake Coliseum at Wallace State is notorious for being a tough place to shoot, but Hartselle finished 7 for 14 from beyond the arch, with four of those coming from Hill. It was the most 3 pointers by any team in the Northwest Regional tournament so far this season.\n\"When we got there the first thing Coach Deline had us do was practice form shooting,\" Hill said. \"This is a different place and you have to focus and keep your mind on the goal. Just think it's as big as a normal gym.\"\nWith the win Hartselle advances to the Regional finals for the first time since 2021. The Tigers will face the winner of Class 6A, No. 1 Hazel Green and No. 2 Clay-Chalkville on Tuesday at 9 a.m.",
