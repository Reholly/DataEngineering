    "text": "Don't let the winter chill fool you, beneath the frosted landscapes and bare branches, life is stirring in the form of tiny, resilient leaf and flower buds. So next time you see a seemingly lifeless branch, remember: it's not the end, it's just a pause. Within those tiny buds lies the promise of life awaiting to burst forth at the first sign of spring.\nFind information to plan your visit\nhere. Reposted from the Red Butte Garden blog. Photos by Glenn Eurick, Kaitlyn Kotar, Heidi M. Simper, and Jason W. Baker.\nPrairifire Crabapple (Malus 'Prairifire')\nStubbornly refusing to let go, last year's leaf petioles cling on just below this year's dormant bud.\nHorse Chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum 'Baumannii')\nHorse Chestnut buds are covered in a sticky resin. This resin creates a waterproof seal that lets the bud grow nice and big before they pop open later in the spring.\nSweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua 'Worplesdon')\nSweetgum buds are mixed buds, meaning they contain both leaves and flowers.\nLoebner Magnolia (Magnolia x loebneri 'Merrill')\nThe soft hairs covering Magnolia buds insulate the delicate flower or leaf tissue inside the bud from the harsh winter elements, such as freezing temperatures and drying winds.\nChokecherry (Prunus virginiana)\nThe outer layer of bud scales are typically made of modified leaves.\nLilac (Syringa reticulata)\nWhile hairs provide insulation in fuzzy buds, hairless buds often rely on other mechanisms like thicker scales, waxy coatings, or internal adaptations to protect themselves.\nLittle Leaf Linden (Tilia cordata)\nAlthough fuzzy buds often steal the show, hairless buds offer their own unique elegance and showcase the fascinating diversity of dormant plant buds.\nMEDIA & PR CONTACTS\n-\nMindy Wilson\nDirector of marketing and public relations, Red Butte Garden\n801.581.4938",
