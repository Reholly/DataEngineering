    "text": "ORLANDO, Fla. – Dozens of young people volunteered their time on Thursday afternoon to pick up trash in the Pine Hills neighborhood of Orange County.\nThose volunteers are members of Future Leaders United , a mentoring program aimed at helping high schoolers prepare for higher education.\nThe group partnered with Light Orlando as part of its L.O.V.E. — Light Orlando Volunteer Experience — Week initiative.\nThat service project began on Monday with a spa night in partnership with One Heart for Women and Children, which served recovering women in the S.T.E.P.S. — Specialized Treatment, Education, and Prevention Services — program.\n[EXCLUSIVE: Become a News 6 Insider (it’s FREE) | PINIT! Share your photos ]\n“We have different people coming in with chair massage, painting nails, haircuts, and we’re having dinner together just as a big family,” One Heart Founder Stephanie Bowman said. “Really help make the women feel special, and, like, they really do matter because each one of us matters.”\nOther events during L.O.V.E. week include a Valentine’s Day party for children, garden clean-up, senior citizen prom, street cleanup and building bunk beds.\nLight Orlando was behind a $250,000 donation to the Salvation Army Angel Tree program last year.\nLeaders with the organization are now calling on volunteers to help serve the community during L.O.V.E. week, which runs through Sunday.\nVisit JustServe.org for details on becoming a volunteer.\nFor more information on Light Orlando’s mission visit LightOrlando.org .\nGet today’s headlines in minutes with Your Florida Daily :\nCopyright 2024 by WKMG ClickOrlando - All rights reserved.",
