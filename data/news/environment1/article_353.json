    "text": "Wolfgang Elsäßer is leaving Swisscom subsidiary blue Entertainment to join Swiss media company CH Media on June 1, 2024.\nThe German media manager, who becomes part of CH Media’s management board, will take over the management of the Swiss TV business with the channels 3+ and TV24 as well as the streaming service oneplus.\nIn his previous role as CEO of blue, Elsäßer was responsible for the operational and strategic management of Swisscom’s entertainment business, leading over 700 employees at 14 locations. From 2016 to 2019, Elsäßer headed Deutsche Telekom’s TV business in Germany, prior to which he was Managing Director of Astra Deutschland.\n“Wolfgang Elsäßer not only has extensive experience in the pay TV and streaming business, he is also a proven leader with team player qualities. I am delighted that I have been able to gain him for my team,” said Michael Wanner, CEO of CH Media.\nElsäßer added: “The potential of CH Media TV AG is huge: the many TV channels, the oneplus app, which is very well distributed in the Swiss market, as well as the great content worlds of live sport, fiction and, in particular, the broad factual entertainment offering. In addition, with the many other content worlds of the CH Media Group, we have a huge ecosystem of new opportunities. I am highly motivated to exploit this potential together with my colleagues.”\nElsäßer succeeds Roger Elsener, who is leaving CH Media at his own request.",
