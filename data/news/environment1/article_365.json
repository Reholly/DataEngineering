    "text": "Preservation efforts at the Penn Center on St. Helena Island BEAUFORT COUNTY, S.C. (WTOC) - The United States National Parks director Chuck Sams visited the Penn Center on St. Helena Island today to discuss efforts to preserve Reconstruction Era History. Sams was shown the restorations made to the Penn Center’s Darrah Hall, the Penn Center’s oldest building. The building’s restoration from stairs to shingles were made possible through the Great American Outdoors Act, which Sam spoke about as well. The Penn Center is just one of many historic landmarks in the Reconstruction Era National Historic Network, which preserves the history of the era from 1861 to 1900. “Similar to dozens of other national parks established in recent years, it is part of an effort to ensure that everyone’s story is reflected in our national story. A story that is not true and complete unless it is diverse and inclusive, and recounts stumbles, along with our great achievements,” United States National Parks Director Chuck Sams said. Sams announced five new additions to the Reconstruction Era National Historic Network across the country, which he said is incredibly meaningful during Black History Month. Those new additions are: • 1838 Black Metropolis • Buffalo Soldiers National Museum in Fort Lawton • Dark Branch Descendants Association • Fort Stanton Historic Site • Fort Union National Monument Copyright 2024 WTOC.
