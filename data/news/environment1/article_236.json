    "text": "METAIRIE, La (WVUE) - Arc of Greater New Orleans is busy recycling beads left on city streets after a long carnival season.\nArc GNO (Greater New Orleans) works to recycle throws left on the street, then package and resell them so they can be used in the future, a process called recycling.\nWhen customers buy recycled throws, the proceeds go towards programs Arc GNO offers for people with intellectual development disabilities.\nRussell Hardy recycles Mardi Gras throws at the organization’s Mardi Gras bead recycle center. Hardy has been a part of Arc GNO’s supportive employment program since 2005. The organization helps people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.\nHardy said the organization has helped him in so many ways.\n“Taking me to get groceries and stuff and, you know, money and all that,” Hardy said.\nHe said he is grateful for the opportunity to make a difference for his community by recycling Mardi Gras throws to keep New Orleans beautiful.\n“I’m helping people keep the streets clean and to keep beads up out of the drains,” he said.\nExecutive director Heather Matthews stresses for the community to put throws in recycling bins across the city.\nIf they do not make it into the bins, they do not get recycled,” Matthews said. “It’s essential that folks find a place to recycle their throws and their Mardi Gras beads.”\nRecycling Mardi Gras throws is something New Orleans Bruce Warner said he takes pride in.\n“It just keeps it out of our landfills and keeps our drains from being clogged,” Warner said.\nMatthews said Arc GNO has begun recycling throws for the St. Partick’s Day, Decadence and Easter parades.\n“We can roll right into next year. We have beads available for special events and parties too, so we are always ready to have themed festivities,” she said.\nSee a spelling or grammar error in our story? Click Here to report it.
