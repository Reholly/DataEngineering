    "text": "The cold-stunned Kemp’s ridley turtles were flown down from New England in December\nCLEARWATER, FL (Feb. 15, 2024) – This week, Clearwater Marine Aquarium released 11 cold-stunned Kemp’s ridley sea turtles back into the Atlantic Ocean near the Cape Canaveral area, after they were rehabilitated for two months at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium.\nIn early December 2023, CMA’s Animal Health team received 16 cold stunned juvenile Kemp’s ridley sea turtles from New England Aquarium in Boston, MA. The turtles were monitored and approximately 75 percent were treated for pneumonia.\nThe other five Kemp’s ridley turtles remain at CMA and are receiving continued care until they have recovered.\n“We are excited to share that 11 of our Kemp’s ridley patients are fully recovered and have been cleared for release by us, as well as Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC). All 11 were ready to go back home to the east coast of Florida into a warmer part of the Atlantic Ocean,” said Dr. Shelly Marquardt, CMA veterinarian.\nEach year, hundreds of sea turtles become vulnerable to colder temperatures in Cape Cod Bay (Massachusetts) where they become stranded on the beaches and need medical attention. Because sea turtles are cold blooded reptiles, they rely on their environment to regulate their body temperatures. When water temperatures drop, their body temperature decreases causing hypothermia and severe debilitation.\nDue to the large number of turtles affected by these cold-stun events, rehabilitation facilities in the northeast frequently collaborate with other facilities to transfer stable patients. This allows facilities such as New England Aquarium to continue to treat cold-stunned turtles during their most critical period.\nA total of 52 cold-stunned sea turtles were flown via private jet to Tampa. CMA, along with three other rehabilitation facilities in Florida, including Mote Marine Laboratory, Florida Aquarium and Loggerhead Marine Life Center, are providing the necessary care and support for their recovery.\nFor more information on how to assist in the recovery efforts of these endangered sea turtles, please visit\nhttps://mission.cmaquarium.org/what-we-do/rescue-rehab-release/\n###\nMedia Contact: Marsha Strickhouser | mstrickhouser@CMAquarium.org | (727) 242-0770\n- About Clearwater Marine Aquarium\n- Clearwater Marine Aquarium (CMA) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit working marine rescue center dedicated to inspiring the human spirit through leadership in education, research, rescue, rehabilitation and release.
