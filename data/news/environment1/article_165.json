    "text": "LONG ISLAND, NY / ACCESSWIRE / Ferary 15, 2024 / Clearview Roofing & Construction has announced their open services for the winter months. For Long Island and Queens residents, December and January bring freezing weather and snow. Clearview is offering their services throughout the winter months, including melting snow off roofs and roof repairs.\nClearview, which operates as both a roofing and full construction company, specializes in shingle roofing, TPO and EPDM Rubber Flat roofing, slate roofing, leak repairs and all the interior restoration involved after a water related event.\nChris Feniello, Managing Partner of Clearview, explains how to prepare homes and buildings for the colder months. \"We certainly have to deal with colder temperatures in December and January,\" says Feniello. \"and it is true you have to take precaution and proper preparations in colder months, but it can be done for sure.\"\n\"It is important that shingles are not frozen and are pliable, so we leave them in the sun until we are ready to nail,\" says Feniello. \"It is also important for a homeowner to know that in the colder temperatures, as it will take longer for the singles to lay down and cure. If after a week of sun, a homeowner notices a shingle or two has not laid down, we can manually seal it with flashing cement, which is a manufacturer recommendation.\"\nFor the coming winter months, New York residents are encouraged to utilize Clearview's roofing services for melting snow off their roof to prevent ice dams, which can seep under shingles and cause damage to ceilings, walls and other structures inside the home. Despite the cold weather, Clearview is experienced in taking precautions when it comes to fulfilling roofing services during the winter.\n\"We install heater cables that are turned on by a switch within the home if homeowners have homes that are prone to Ice Dams. Ice Dams, which occur when snow buildup melts and then refreezes, can be avoided with our heater cables placed in a zig-zag formation on the roof.\"\nLong Island and Queens residents may still turn to Clearview for any of their construction or roofing necessities, and as the company continues to grow, their volume of insurance restoration jobs has also expanded. \"We have all the mitigation equipment necessary to handle these insurance related claims, like air movers, air scrubbers and power vacuums to remove water out of basements from flooding or pipe burst events,\" says Chris Feniello. \"We have serviced many homeowners with their insurance claims and we feel that the south shore is in need of these services as well.\"\nClearview is big on safety and accountability. There is such a thing as too cold to lay a roof, though for emergency situations, the company offers their services so long as it's above freezing temperatures. \"If there is an emergency, we can utilize warmers to warm the shingles if necessary. Generally, as soon as it's below 30 degrees, which traditionally ends up being the month of February in Long island, we don't roof homes. However, if it's 30 in the morning but warms up to 40 degrees during the day, that is considered very acceptable working conditions.\nTo take precautions for the winter months and the freezing temperatures, Clearview encourages Long Island residents to seek their services sooner rather than later. They hope to continue fulfilling orders throughout the winter to those that require a roof replacement as soon as possible.\nAbout the Company:\nClearview Roofing & Construction is a family-owned Long-Island roofing company that first started in 1961. For the past few decades, they have provided Long Island and Queens communities with a myriad of efficient services for an affordable price. Their current locations include offices in Port Washington, Huntington and Rockville Centre, all of Nassau, Suffolk and Queens counties.\nTo get a free on-site estimate or request a quote, contact Clearview Roofing & Construction through their website at https://longislandroofs.com/ or contact:\nChris Feniello, Clearview Roofing & Construction\nclearviewnorthport@gmail.com\nSOURCE: Clearview Roofing and Construction\nView the original press release on accesswire.com",
