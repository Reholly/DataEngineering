I think she’s stronger, she gets off the ground fast and she can elevate and have her hands on the ball.”\nThe game was tied 41-41 with 5:40 remaining when McBee made a 3-pointer from the left wing and then converted an and-1 reverse layup to put UH ahead by six.\nAfter a 3-pointer by Annika Shah cut Hawaii’s lead in half, Cal Poly’s Sydney Bourbond was whistled for her fourth foul and then called for a technical foul to end her night.\nMcBee converted all four free throws and then added a layup to push UH’s lead to nine. Kelsie Imai followed with a spinning layup to put UH ahead by double figures.\n“That poise was very important because it cost (Cal Poly) seven points,” McBee said.\nShah finished with a team-high 14 points for the Mustangs (13-10, 9-5), who have lost six straight to UH.\nNeither team led by more than seven points in a tightly contested first half in which UH held the Mustangs to 32% shooting (8-for-25).\nJacque David capped a 7-0 UH run late in the second quarter with a layup as UH enjoyed a 14-8 advantage in points in the paint.\nShah, the Mustangs’ leading scorer, ended Cal Poly’s 1-for-11 funk from the field with a 3-pointer with 14 seconds left in the second quarter.\nHawaii quickly pushed the ball down the floor and Lily Wahinekapu sunk a fall-away jumper from the right side to give UH a 28-22 halftime advantage.\nCal Poly cut the deficit in half heading into the fourth quarter, closing with four points in the final 43 seconds.\n“I thought we played a little frustrated for the first three-and-a-half quarters and I don’t know why,” Beeman said. “I thought we had a really good timeout where a few of the players really took over and talked about the adjustments we needed to make, talked about our energy and talked about why we were playing so frustrated.”\nSidney Richards ended a five-minute Cal Poly scoring drought with a layup in the paint and Sierra Lichtie sunk two free throws in the final two seconds after Daejah Phillips had a bucket taken away due to a questionable offensive foul that could have made it an eight-point UH lead.\nRichards made two free throws with 8:30 remaining to give Cal Poly its first lead since it scored the first basket of the game.\nWahinekapu answered with a three-point play at the other end to put UH back in front and it never trailed again.\nMcBee’s second 3 pushed her past Julissa Tago into fourth place on UH’s career 3s made list with 141.\nBIG WEST WOMEN\nConference Overall\nW L Pct.
